Prior\napproaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget\nconstraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical\ninformation from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We\nhypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more\nconcise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy\nOptimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum\nlength over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO\nemploys a novel length reward function based on this history state to\nincentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those\npreviously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing\nshorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards\nmore efficient solutions.

The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral\ntrajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can\nintroduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may\ntrigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address\nthe safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we\npropose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing\na lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each\nhigh-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected\nthought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions\nand tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning\nphase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy\nand widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner\nmodel, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios\nand simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse\ninstructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is\nfine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three\nagent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that\nThought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the\nunprotected setting to 90% on average.

While\nunderstanding linguistic metaphors has advanced significantly, grasping\nmultimodal metaphors, such as those found in internet memes, presents unique\nchallenges due to their unconventional expressions and implied meanings.\nExisting methods for multimodal metaphor identification often struggle to\nbridge the gap between literal and figurative interpretations. Additionally,\ngenerative approaches that utilize large language models or text-to-image\nmodels, while promising, suffer from high computational costs. This paper\nintroduces \\textbf{C}oncept \\textbf{D}rift \\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{L}ayerNorm\n\\textbf{T}uning (\\textbf{CDGLT}), a novel and training-efficient framework for\nmultimodal metaphor identification. CDGLT incorporates two key innovations: (1)\nConcept Drift, a mechanism that leverages Spherical Linear Interpolation\n(SLERP) of cross-modal embeddings from a CLIP encoder to generate a new,\ndivergent concept embedding. This drifted concept helps to alleviate the gap\nbetween literal features and the figurative task. (2) A prompt construction\nstrategy, that adapts the method of feature extraction and fusion using\npre-trained language models for the multimodal metaphor identification task.\nCDGLT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MET-Meme benchmark while\nsignificantly reducing training costs compared to existing generative methods.\nAblation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both Concept Drift and our\nadapted LN Tuning approach. Our method represents a significant step towards\nefficient and accurate multimodal metaphor understanding.

{"title": "Covariance Symmetries Classification in Multitemporal/Multipass PolSAR Images", "abstract": "A polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) system, which uses multiple\nimages acquired with different polarizations in both transmission and\nreception, has the potential to improve the description and interpretation of\nthe observed scene. This is typically achieved by exploiting the polarimetric\ncovariance or coherence matrix associated with each pixel, which is processed\nto meet a specific goal in Earth observation. This paper presents a design\nframework for selecting the structure of the polarimetric covariance matrix\nthat accurately reflects the symmetry associated with the analyzed pixels. The\nproposed methodology leverages both polarimetric and temporal information from\nmultipass PolSAR images to enhance the retrieval of information from the\nacquired data. To accomplish this, it is assumed that the covariance matrix (of\nthe overall acquired data) is given as the Kronecker product of the temporal\nand polarimetric covariances. An alternating maximization algorithm, known as\nthe flip-flop method, is then developed to estimate both matrices while\nenforcing the symmetry constraint on the polarimetric covariance. Subsequently,\nthe symmetry structure classification is formulated as a multiple hypothesis\ntesting problem, which is solved using model order selection techniques. The\nproposed approach is quantitatively assessed on simulated data, showing its\nadvantages over its competitor, which does not exploit temporal correlations.\nFor example, it reaches accuracies of 94.6% and 92.0% for the reflection and\nazimuth symmetry classes, respectively, while the competitor achieves 72.5% and\n72.6% under the same simulation conditions.

This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning\nbenchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of\nreasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables,\nlocalizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning\nover states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and\nworld-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge\n(e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct\nspatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552\nchallenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter.\nEvaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks\nrequiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation),\nparticularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust\nperformance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or\nsurpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in\nreasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and\nLRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model\ncontinues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result\nattributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models.

Mainstream approaches\nfollow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling\nitem topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics\nbased on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the\nmodeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical\nconfounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the\nbehavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and\nlearn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show\nthat it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient\nintegration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems,\nfor which we propose TagCF.

On the other hand, TagCF\npresents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the\nextracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We\nconduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and\npublic datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically\nshow that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than\nthe modeling of item topics.

Inter-balancing aims to mitigate the gradient imbalance\nbetween PDE residual loss and condition-fitting losses by determining an\naggregated weight that offsets their gradient distribution discrepancies.\nIntra-balancing acts on condition-fitting losses to tackle the imbalance in\nfitting difficulty across diverse conditions. By evaluating the fitting\ndifficulty based on the loss records, intra-balancing can allocate the\naggregated weight proportionally to each condition loss according to its\nfitting difficulty level.
