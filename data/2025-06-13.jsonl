In response to this,\nour paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies\nfor adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,\nincluding x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel\ndesigns and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and\ndemonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over\nfloating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.\nThese contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the\ndemands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as\nthe \"Cambrian period\" for matrix multiplication.", "published": "2025-06-13 12:40:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11728v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

However, the efficacy of RLVR\ndiminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,\ncharacterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure\nrates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for\neffective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce\nAgent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic\nsettings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by\nhuman pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively\nsteers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse\ninformational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to\ndynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate\na teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces\nand promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In\nthe Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce\ninitial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented\nwith agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy\nis updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.\nAgent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%\nto 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified.

Nine image-based features\nwere selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision\nTree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The\nmodels were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified\ndeformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.\nAll models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or\nnegatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of\ndifferent VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)\nvalues. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and\nstandardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments.

First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability.

Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as\npoints sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\\mathcal{M} \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to\nembeddings that represent their coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric\ngraph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to\ndistances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem\ninto a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is\nsolved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a\ntheoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this\ndata-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from\n$\\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes\nwith increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training\nprocedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during\ntraining, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further,\nvanishing asymptotically.

We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW)\nmethods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier\ntypes, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results\nshow that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced\nfold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures\nsensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that\nclassifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal\npartitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more\neffectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis\nreveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable\nperformance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked\nsensitivity.

{"title": "SSLAM: Enhancing Self-Supervised Models with Audio Mixtures for Polyphonic Soundscapes", "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in\nreal-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These\nnetworks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the\nSSL pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio.\nHowever, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform\nin real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex,\ninvolving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio SSL methods are\noften benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as\nenvironmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to\ngeneralize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios,\nremains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical\nrobustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap,\nwe introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel\ndirection in audio SSL research, designed to improve, designed to improve the\nmodel's ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong\nperformance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio\nSSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis against SOTA methods using a range of\nhigh-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets.
