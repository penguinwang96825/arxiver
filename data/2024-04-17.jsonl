{"title": "Deep Joint Learning valuation of Bermudan Swaptions", "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of pricing involved financial derivatives by means of advanced of deep learning techniques. More precisely, we smartly combine several sophisticated neural network-based concepts like differential machine learning, Monte Carlo simulation-like training samples and joint learning to come up with an efficient numerical solution. The application of the latter development represents a novelty in the context of computational finance. We also propose a novel design of interdependent neural networks to price early-exercise products, in this case, Bermudan swaptions. The improvements in efficiency and accuracy provided by the here proposed approach is widely illustrated throughout a range of numerical experiments. Moreover, this novel methodology can be extended to the pricing of other financial derivatives.", "published": "2024-04-17 11:07:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11257v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.NA"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
