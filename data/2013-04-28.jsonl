{"title": "Measuring Cultural Relativity of Emotional Valence and Arousal using\n  Semantic Clustering and Twitter", "abstract": "Researchers since at least Darwin have debated whether and to what extent\nemotions are universal or culture-dependent. However, previous studies have\nprimarily focused on facial expressions and on a limited set of emotions. Given\nthat emotions have a substantial impact on human lives, evidence for cultural\nemotional relativity might be derived by applying distributional semantics\ntechniques to a text corpus of self-reported behaviour. Here, we explore this\nidea by measuring the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion\nkeywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter. We do this in three\ngeographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. We demonstrate that in\nour sample, the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ\nsignificantly with respect to these geographical regions --- Europeans are, or\nat least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are\nmore negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when\ncompared to global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords. Our\nwork is the first in kind to programatically map large text corpora to a\ndimensional model of affect.", "published": "2013-04-28 19:30:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7507v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
