{"title": "Tree-width of hypergraphs and surface duality", "abstract": "In Graph Minor III, Robertson and Seymour conjecture that the tree-width of a planar graph and that of its dual differ by at most one. We prove that given a hypergraph H on a surface of Euler genus k, the tree-width of H^* is at most the maximum of tw(H) + 1 + k and the maximum size of a hyperedge of H^*.", "published": "2008-12-16 07:47:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2990v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
