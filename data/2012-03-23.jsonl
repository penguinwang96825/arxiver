{"title": "International Stock Market Efficiency: A Non-Bayesian Time-Varying Model Approach", "abstract": "This paper develops a non-Bayesian methodology to analyze the time-varying structure of international linkages and market efficiency in G7 countries. We consider a non-Bayesian time-varying vector autoregressive (TV-VAR) model, and apply it to estimate the joint degree of market efficiency in the sense of Fama (1970, 1991). Our empirical results provide a new perspective that the international linkages and market efficiency change over time and that their behaviors correspond well to historical events of the international financial system.", "published": "2012-03-23 05:30:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5176v14", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
