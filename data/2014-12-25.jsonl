{"title": "Plagiarism Detection on Electronic Text based Assignments using Vector\n  Space Model (ICIAfS14)", "abstract": "Plagiarism is known as illegal use of others' part of work or whole work as\none's own in any field such as art, poetry, literature, cinema, research and\nother creative forms of study. Plagiarism is one of the important issues in\nacademic and research fields and giving more concern in academic systems. The\nsituation is even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web.\nThis paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying\nsuitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by\ncomparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity\nmeasure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram\nand trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more\ntime, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected\ntrigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with\ntri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results,\ncosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because,\nit focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the\ndataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more\npreferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be\nused as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and\nminimize the plagiarism among students.", "published": "2014-12-25 03:54:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7782v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
