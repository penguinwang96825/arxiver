{"title": "Meaning-focused and Quantum-inspired Information Retrieval", "abstract": "In recent years, quantum-based methods have promisingly integrated the\ntraditional procedures in information retrieval (IR) and natural language\nprocessing (NLP). Inspired by our research on the identification and\napplication of quantum structures in cognition, more specifically our work on\nthe representation of concepts and their combinations, we put forward a\n'quantum meaning based' framework for structured query retrieval in text\ncorpora and standardized testing corpora. This scheme for IR rests on\nconsidering as basic notions, (i) 'entities of meaning', e.g., concepts and\ntheir combinations and (ii) traces of such entities of meaning, which is how\ndocuments are considered in this approach. The meaning content of these\n'entities of meaning' is reconstructed by solving an 'inverse problem' in the\nquantum formalism, consisting of reconstructing the full states of the entities\nof meaning from their collapsed states identified as traces in relevant\ndocuments. The advantages with respect to traditional approaches, such as\nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA), are discussed by means of concrete examples.", "published": "2013-03-30 13:08:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0104v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
