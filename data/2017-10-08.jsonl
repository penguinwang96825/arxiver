{"title": "The IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus", "abstract": "We present the IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus. The corpus is a\ncompilation of parallel corpora previously available in the public domain as\nwell as new parallel corpora we collected. The corpus contains 1.49 million\nparallel segments, of which 694k segments were not previously available in the\npublic domain. The corpus has been pre-processed for machine translation, and\nwe report baseline phrase-based SMT and NMT translation results on this corpus.\nThis corpus has been used in two editions of shared tasks at the Workshop on\nAsian Language Translation (2016 and 2017). The corpus is freely available for\nnon-commercial research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest\npublicly available English-Hindi parallel corpus.", "published": "2017-10-08 16:56:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02855v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Annotating High-Level Structures of Short Stories and Personal Anecdotes", "abstract": "Stories are a vital form of communication in human culture; they are employed\ndaily to persuade, to elicit sympathy, or to convey a message. Computational\nunderstanding of human narratives, especially high-level narrative structures,\nremain limited to date. Multiple literary theories for narrative structures\nexist, but operationalization of the theories has remained a challenge. We\ndeveloped an annotation scheme by consolidating and extending existing\nnarratological theories, including Labov and Waletsky's (1967) functional\ncategorization scheme and Freytag's (1863) pyramid of dramatic tension, and\npresent 360 annotated short stories collected from online sources. In the\nfuture, this research will support an approach that enables systems to\nintelligently sustain complex communications with humans.", "published": "2017-10-08 21:12:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06917v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Smarnet: Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend Like Human", "abstract": "Machine Comprehension (MC) is a challenging task in Natural Language\nProcessing field, which aims to guide the machine to comprehend a passage and\nanswer the given question. Many existing approaches on MC task are suffering\nthe inefficiency in some bottlenecks, such as insufficient lexical\nunderstanding, complex question-passage interaction, incorrect answer\nextraction and so on. In this paper, we address these problems from the\nviewpoint of how humans deal with reading tests in a scientific way.\nSpecifically, we first propose a novel lexical gating mechanism to dynamically\ncombine the words and characters representations. We then guide the machines to\nread in an interactive way with attention mechanism and memory network. Finally\nwe add a checking layer to refine the answer for insurance. The extensive\nexperiments on two popular datasets SQuAD and TriviaQA show that our method\nexceeds considerable performance than most state-of-the-art solutions at the\ntime of submission.", "published": "2017-10-08 02:51:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02772v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

We use distributed word representations of the\nwords in the title as features to identify clickbaits in online news media. We\ntrain a machine learning model using linear regression to predict the cickbait\nscore of a given tweet. Our methods achieve an F1-score of 64.98\\% and an MSE\nof 0.0791.
