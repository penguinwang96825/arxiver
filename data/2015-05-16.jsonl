{"title": "A type-theoretical approach to Universal Grammar", "abstract": "The idea of Universal Grammar (UG) as the hypothetical linguistic structure\nshared by all human languages harkens back at least to the 13th century. The\nbest known modern elaborations of the idea are due to Chomsky. Following a\ndevastating critique from theoretical, typological and field linguistics, these\nelaborations, the idea of UG itself and the more general idea of language\nuniversals stand untenable and are largely abandoned. The proposal tackles the\nhypothetical contents of UG using dependent and polymorphic type theory in a\nframework very different from the Chomskyan ones. We introduce a type logic for\na precise, universal and parsimonious representation of natural language\nmorphosyntax and compositional semantics. The logic handles grammatical\nambiguity (with polymorphic types), selectional restrictions and diverse kinds\nof anaphora (with dependent types), and features a partly universal set of\nmorphosyntactic types (by the Curry-Howard isomorphism).", "published": "2015-05-16 19:28:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04313v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.LO", "03"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
