{"title": "Syntax-Directed Variational Autoencoder for Structured Data", "abstract": "Deep generative models have been enjoying success in modeling continuous\ndata. However it remains challenging to capture the representations for\ndiscrete structures with formal grammars and semantics, e.g., computer programs\nand molecular structures. How to generate both syntactically and semantically\ncorrect data still remains largely an open problem. Inspired by the theory of\ncompiler where the syntax and semantics check is done via syntax-directed\ntranslation (SDT), we propose a novel syntax-directed variational autoencoder\n(SD-VAE) by introducing stochastic lazy attributes. This approach converts the\noffline SDT check into on-the-fly generated guidance for constraining the\ndecoder. Comparing to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach enforces\nconstraints on the output space so that the output will be not only\nsyntactically valid, but also semantically reasonable. We evaluate the proposed\nmodel with applications in programming language and molecules, including\nreconstruction and program/molecule optimization. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness in incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints in discrete\ngenerative models, which is significantly better than current state-of-the-art\napproaches.", "published": "2018-02-24 02:34:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08786v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
