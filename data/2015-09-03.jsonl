{"title": "On TimeML-Compliant Temporal Expression Extraction in Turkish", "abstract": "It is commonly acknowledged that temporal expression extractors are important\ncomponents of larger natural language processing systems like information\nretrieval and question answering systems. Extraction and normalization of\ntemporal expressions in Turkish has not been given attention so far except the\nextraction of some date and time expressions within the course of named entity\nrecognition. As TimeML is the current standard of temporal expression and event\nannotation in natural language texts, in this paper, we present an analysis of\ntemporal expressions in Turkish based on the related TimeML classification\n(i.e., date, time, duration, and set expressions). We have created a lexicon\nfor Turkish temporal expressions and devised considerably wide-coverage\npatterns using the lexical classes as the building blocks. We believe that the\nproposed patterns, together with convenient normalization rules, can be readily\nused by prospective temporal expression extraction tools for Turkish.", "published": "2015-09-03 07:23:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00963v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Encoding Prior Knowledge with Eigenword Embeddings", "abstract": "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a method for reducing the dimension\nof data represented using two views. It has been previously used to derive word\nembeddings, where one view indicates a word, and the other view indicates its\ncontext. We describe a way to incorporate prior knowledge into CCA, give a\ntheoretical justification for it, and test it by deriving word embeddings and\nevaluating them on a myriad of datasets.", "published": "2015-09-03 09:39:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01007v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The influence of Chunking on Dependency Crossing and Distance", "abstract": "This paper hypothesizes that chunking plays important role in reducing\ndependency distance and dependency crossings. Computer simulations, when\ncompared with natural languages,show that chunking reduces mean dependency\ndistance (MDD) of a linear sequence of nodes (constrained by continuity or\nprojectivity) to that of natural languages. More interestingly, chunking alone\nbrings about less dependency crossings as well, though having failed to reduce\nthem, to such rarity as found in human languages. These results suggest that\nchunking may play a vital role in the minimization of dependency distance, and\na somewhat contributing role in the rarity of dependency crossing. In addition,\nthe results point to a possibility that the rarity of dependency crossings is\nnot a mere side-effect of minimization of dependency distance, but a linguistic\nphenomenon with its own motivations.", "published": "2015-09-03 23:57:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01310v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generating Weather Forecast Texts with Case Based Reasoning", "abstract": "Several techniques have been used to generate weather forecast texts. In this\npaper, case based reasoning (CBR) is proposed for weather forecast text\ngeneration because similar weather conditions occur over time and should have\nsimilar forecast texts. CBR-METEO, a system for generating weather forecast\ntexts was developed using a generic framework (jCOLIBRI) which provides modules\nfor the standard components of the CBR architecture. The advantage in a CBR\napproach is that systems can be built in minimal time with far less human\neffort after initial consultation with experts. The approach depends heavily on\nthe goodness of the retrieval and revision components of the CBR process. We\nevaluated CBRMETEO with NIST, an automated metric which has been shown to\ncorrelate well with human judgements for this domain. The system shows\ncomparable performance with other NLG systems that perform the same task.", "published": "2015-09-03 10:21:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01023v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Incremental Active Opinion Learning Over a Stream of Opinionated\n  Documents", "abstract": "Applications that learn from opinionated documents, like tweets or product\nreviews, face two challenges. First, the opinionated documents constitute an\nevolving stream, where both the author's attitude and the vocabulary itself may\nchange. Second, labels of documents are scarce and labels of words are\nunreliable, because the sentiment of a word depends on the (unknown) context in\nthe author's mind. Most of the research on mining over opinionated streams\nfocuses on the first aspect of the problem, whereas for the second a continuous\nsupply of labels from the stream is assumed. Such an assumption though is\nutopian as the stream is infinite and the labeling cost is prohibitive. To this\nend, we investigate the potential of active stream learning algorithms that ask\nfor labels on demand. Our proposed ACOSTREAM 1 approach works with limited\nlabels: it uses an initial seed of labeled documents, occasionally requests\nadditional labels for documents from the human expert and incrementally adapts\nto the underlying stream while exploiting the available labeled documents. In\nits core, ACOSTREAM consists of a MNB classifier coupled with \"sampling\"\nstrategies for requesting class labels for new unlabeled documents. In the\nexperiments, we evaluate the classifier performance over time by varying: (a)\nthe class distribution of the opinionated stream, while assuming that the set\nof the words in the vocabulary is fixed but their polarities may change with\nthe class distribution; and (b) the number of unknown words arriving at each\nmoment, while the class polarity may also change. Our results show that active\nlearning on a stream of opinionated documents, delivers good performance while\nrequiring a small selection of labels", "published": "2015-09-03 22:11:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01288v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
