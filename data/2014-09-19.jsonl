For the given site, processed with a crowdsourcing system, a\nsentence-aligned corpus can be fetched, which covers a very narrow domain of\nterminology and language patterns - a site-specific domain.

{"title": "Interactive Visual Exploration of Topic Models using Graphs", "abstract": "Probabilistic topic modeling is a popular and powerful family of tools for\nuncovering thematic structure in large sets of unstructured text documents.\nWhile much attention has been directed towards the modeling algorithms and\ntheir various extensions, comparatively few studies have concerned how to\npresent or visualize topic models in meaningful ways. In this paper, we present\na novel design that uses graphs to visually communicate topic structure and\nmeaning. By connecting topic nodes via descriptive keyterms, the graph\nrepresentation reveals topic similarities, topic meaning and shared, ambiguous\nkeyterms. At the same time, the graph can be used for information retrieval\npurposes, to find documents by topic or topic subsets. To exemplify the utility\nof the design, we illustrate its use for organizing and exploring corpora of\nfinancial patents.", "published": "2014-09-19 12:26:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5623v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "I.5.5"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
