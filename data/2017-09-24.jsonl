{"title": "Long Text Generation via Adversarial Training with Leaked Information", "abstract": "Automatically generating coherent and semantically meaningful text has many\napplications in machine translation, dialogue systems, image captioning, etc.\nRecently, by combining with policy gradient, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)\nthat use a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model\nas a reinforcement learning policy has shown promising results in text\ngeneration. However, the scalar guiding signal is only available after the\nentire text has been generated and lacks intermediate information about text\nstructure during the generative process. As such, it limits its success when\nthe length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this\npaper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for\nlong text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own\nhigh-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the\nguidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all\ngeneration steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the\nextracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to\nguide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on\nsynthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that\nLeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the\nperformance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any\nsupervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only\nthrough the interaction between Manager and Worker.", "published": "2017-09-24 13:35:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08624v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "HDLTex: Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text Classification", "abstract": "The continually increasing number of documents produced each year\nnecessitates ever improving information processing methods for searching,\nretrieving, and organizing text. Central to these information processing\nmethods is document classification, which has become an important application\nfor supervised learning. Recently the performance of these traditional\nclassifiers has degraded as the number of documents has increased. This is\nbecause along with this growth in the number of documents has come an increase\nin the number of categories. This paper approaches this problem differently\nfrom current document classification methods that view the problem as\nmulti-class classification. Instead we perform hierarchical classification\nusing an approach we call Hierarchical Deep Learning for Text classification\n(HDLTex). HDLTex employs stacks of deep learning architectures to provide\nspecialized understanding at each level of the document hierarchy.", "published": "2017-09-24 21:58:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08267v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "A Hybrid DSP/Deep Learning Approach to Real-Time Full-Band Speech\n  Enhancement", "abstract": "Despite noise suppression being a mature area in signal processing, it\nremains highly dependent on fine tuning of estimator algorithms and parameters.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid DSP/deep learning approach to noise\nsuppression. A deep neural network with four hidden layers is used to estimate\nideal critical band gains, while a more traditional pitch filter attenuates\nnoise between pitch harmonics. The approach achieves significantly higher\nquality than a traditional minimum mean squared error spectral estimator, while\nkeeping the complexity low enough for real-time operation at 48 kHz on a\nlow-power processor.", "published": "2017-09-24 19:23:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08243v3", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
