{"title": "Statistical arbitrage in multi-pair trading strategy based on graph clustering algorithms in US equities market", "abstract": "The study seeks to develop an effective strategy based on the novel framework\nof statistical arbitrage based on graph clustering algorithms. Amalgamation of\nquantitative and machine learning methods, including the Kelly criterion, and\nan ensemble of machine learning classifiers have been used to improve\nrisk-adjusted returns and increase immunity to transaction costs over existing\napproaches. The study seeks to provide an integrated approach to optimal signal\ndetection and risk management. As a part of this approach, innovative ways of\noptimizing take profit and stop loss functions for daily frequency trading\nstrategies have been proposed and tested. All of the tested approaches\noutperformed appropriate benchmarks. The best combinations of the techniques\nand parameters demonstrated significantly better performance metrics than the\nrelevant benchmarks. The results have been obtained under the assumption of\nrealistic transaction costs, but are sensitive to changes in some key\nparameters.", "published": "2024-06-15 17:25:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10695v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.TR", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
