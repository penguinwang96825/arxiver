{"title": "An Information Retrieval Approach to Short Text Conversation", "abstract": "Human computer conversation is regarded as one of the most difficult problems\nin artificial intelligence. In this paper, we address one of its key\nsub-problems, referred to as short text conversation, in which given a message\nfrom human, the computer returns a reasonable response to the message. We\nleverage the vast amount of short conversation data available on social media\nto study the issue. We propose formalizing short text conversation as a search\nproblem at the first step, and employing state-of-the-art information retrieval\n(IR) techniques to carry out the task. We investigate the significance as well\nas the limitation of the IR approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the\nretrieval-based model can make the system behave rather \"intelligently\", when\ncombined with a huge repository of conversation data from social media.", "published": "2014-08-29 12:04:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6988v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
