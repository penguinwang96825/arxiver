{"title": "Knowlege Graph Embedding by Flexible Translation", "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding refers to projecting entities and relations in\nknowledge graph into continuous vector spaces. State-of-the-art methods, such\nas TransE, TransH, and TransR build embeddings by treating relation as\ntranslation from head entity to tail entity. However, previous models can not\ndeal with reflexive/one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relations properly, or\nlack of scalability and efficiency. Thus, we propose a novel method, flexible\ntranslation, named TransF, to address the above issues. TransF regards relation\nas translation between head entity vector and tail entity vector with flexible\nmagnitude. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct link prediction and\ntriple classification on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our\nmethod remarkably improve the performance compared with several\nstate-of-the-art baselines.", "published": "2015-05-20 05:57:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05253v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
