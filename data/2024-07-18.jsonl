{"title": "Construction and Hedging of Equity Index Options Portfolios", "abstract": "This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of systematic index\noption-writing strategies, focusing on S&P500 index options. We compare the\nperformance of hedging strategies using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model\nand the Variance-Gamma (VG) model, emphasizing varying moneyness levels and\ndifferent sizing methods based on delta and the VIX Index. The study employs\n1-minute data of S&P500 index options and index quotes spanning from 2018 to\n2023. The analysis benchmarks hedged strategies against buy-and-hold and naked\noption-writing strategies, with a focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics\nincluding transaction costs. Portfolio delta approximations are derived using\nimplied volatility for the BSM model and market-calibrated parameters for the\nVG model. Key findings reveal that systematic option-writing strategies can\npotentially yield superior returns compared to buy-and-hold benchmarks. The BSM\nmodel generally provided better hedging outcomes than the VG model, although\nthe VG model showed profitability in certain naked strategies as a tool for\nposition sizing. In terms of rehedging frequency, we found that intraday\nhedging in 130-minute intervals provided both reliable protection against\nadverse market movements and a satisfactory returns profile.", "published": "2024-07-18 21:49:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13908v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
{"title": "Dynamic Pricing in Securities Lending Market: Application in Revenue Optimization for an Agent Lender Portfolio", "abstract": "Securities lending is an important part of the financial market structure,\nwhere agent lenders help long term institutional investors to lend out their\nsecurities to short sellers in exchange for a lending fee. Agent lenders within\nthe market seek to optimize revenue by lending out securities at the highest\nrate possible. Typically, this rate is set by hard-coded business rules or\nstandard supervised machine learning models. These approaches are often\ndifficult to scale and are not adaptive to changing market conditions. Unlike a\ntraditional stock exchange with a centralized limit order book, the securities\nlending market is organized similarly to an e-commerce marketplace, where agent\nlenders and borrowers can transact at any agreed price in a bilateral fashion.\nThis similarity suggests that the use of typical methods for addressing dynamic\npricing problems in e-commerce could be effective in the securities lending\nmarket. We show that existing contextual bandit frameworks can be successfully\nutilized in the securities lending market. Using offline evaluation on real\nhistorical data, we show that the contextual bandit approach can consistently\noutperform typical approaches by at least 15% in terms of total revenue\ngenerated.", "published": "2024-07-18 17:42:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13687v4", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
