{"title": "Accomplishable Tasks in Knowledge Representation", "abstract": "Knowledge Representation (KR) is traditionally based on the logic of facts,\nexpressed in boolean logic. However, facts about an agent can also be seen as a\nset of accomplished tasks by the agent. This paper proposes a new approach to\nKR: the notion of task logical KR based on Computability Logic. This notion\nallows the user to represent both accomplished tasks and accomplishable tasks\nby the agent. This notion allows us to build sophisticated KRs about many\ninteresting agents, which have not been supported by previous logical\nlanguages.", "published": "2013-06-07 04:42:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2268v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
