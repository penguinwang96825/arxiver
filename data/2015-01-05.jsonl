{"title": "Chasing the Ghosts of Ibsen: A computational stylistic analysis of drama\n  in translation", "abstract": "Research into the stylistic properties of translations is an issue which has\nreceived some attention in computational stylistics. Previous work by Rybicki\n(2006) on the distinguishing of character idiolects in the work of Polish\nauthor Henryk Sienkiewicz and two corresponding English translations using\nBurrow's Delta method concluded that idiolectal differences could be observed\nin the source texts and this variation was preserved to a large degree in both\ntranslations. This study also found that the two translations were also highly\ndistinguishable from one another. Burrows (2002) examined English translations\nof Juvenal also using the Delta method, results of this work suggest that some\ntranslators are more adept at concealing their own style when translating the\nworks of another author whereas other authors tend to imprint their own style\nto a greater extent on the work they translate. Our work examines the writing\nof a single author, Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, and these writings\ntranslated into both German and English from Norwegian, in an attempt to\ninvestigate the preservation of characterization, defined here as the\ndistinctiveness of textual contributions of characters.", "published": "2015-01-05 12:55:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00841v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Characterizing the Google Books corpus: Strong limits to inferences of\n  socio-cultural and linguistic evolution", "abstract": "It is tempting to treat frequency trends from the Google Books data sets as\nindicators of the \"true\" popularity of various words and phrases. Doing so\nallows us to draw quantitatively strong conclusions about the evolution of\ncultural perception of a given topic, such as time or gender. However, the\nGoogle Books corpus suffers from a number of limitations which make it an\nobscure mask of cultural popularity. A primary issue is that the corpus is in\neffect a library, containing one of each book. A single, prolific author is\nthereby able to noticeably insert new phrases into the Google Books lexicon,\nwhether the author is widely read or not. With this understood, the Google\nBooks corpus remains an important data set to be considered more lexicon-like\nthan text-like. Here, we show that a distinct problematic feature arises from\nthe inclusion of scientific texts, which have become an increasingly\nsubstantive portion of the corpus throughout the 1900s. The result is a surge\nof phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general, such as\nreferences to time in the form of citations. We highlight these dynamics by\nexamining and comparing major contributions to the statistical divergence of\nEnglish data sets between decades in the period 1800--2000. We find that only\nthe English Fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not\nheavily affected by professional texts, in clear contrast to the first version\nof the fiction data set and both unfiltered English data sets. Our findings\nemphasize the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the Google Books\ncorpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural\nand linguistic evolution.", "published": "2015-01-05 20:09:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960v4", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.CL", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
