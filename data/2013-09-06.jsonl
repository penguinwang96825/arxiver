{"title": "Preparing Korean Data for the Shared Task on Parsing Morphologically\n  Rich Languages", "abstract": "This document gives a brief description of Korean data prepared for the SPMRL\n2013 shared task. A total of 27,363 sentences with 350,090 tokens are used for\nthe shared task. All constituent trees are collected from the KAIST Treebank\nand transformed to the Penn Treebank style. All dependency trees are converted\nfrom the transformed constituent trees using heuristics and labeling rules de-\nsigned specifically for the KAIST Treebank. In addition to the gold-standard\nmorphological analysis provided by the KAIST Treebank, two sets of automatic\nmorphological analysis are provided for the shared task, one is generated by\nthe HanNanum morphological analyzer, and the other is generated by the Sejong\nmorphological analyzer.", "published": "2013-09-06 14:28:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1649v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Rank-frequency relation for Chinese characters", "abstract": "We show that the Zipf's law for Chinese characters perfectly holds for\nsufficiently short texts (few thousand different characters). The scenario of\nits validity is similar to the Zipf's law for words in short English texts. For\nlong Chinese texts (or for mixtures of short Chinese texts), rank-frequency\nrelations for Chinese characters display a two-layer, hierarchic structure that\ncombines a Zipfian power-law regime for frequent characters (first layer) with\nan exponential-like regime for less frequent characters (second layer). For\nthese two layers we provide different (though related) theoretical descriptions\nthat include the range of low-frequency characters (hapax legomena). The\ncomparative analysis of rank-frequency relations for Chinese characters versus\nEnglish words illustrates the extent to which the characters play for Chinese\nwriters the same role as the words for those writing within alphabetical\nsystems.", "published": "2013-09-06 04:48:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1536v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
