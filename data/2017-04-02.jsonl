{"title": "Building a Neural Machine Translation System Using Only Synthetic\n  Parallel Data", "abstract": "Recent works have shown that synthetic parallel data automatically generated\nby translation models can be effective for various neural machine translation\n(NMT) issues. In this study, we build NMT systems using only synthetic parallel\ndata. As an efficient alternative to real parallel data, we also present a new\ntype of synthetic parallel corpus. The proposed pseudo parallel data are\ndistinct from previous works in that ground truth and synthetic examples are\nmixed on both sides of sentence pairs. Experiments on Czech-German and\nFrench-German translations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pseudo\nparallel corpus, which shows not only enhanced results for bidirectional\ntranslation tasks but also substantial improvement with the aid of a ground\ntruth real parallel corpus.", "published": "2017-04-02 05:54:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00253v4", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Word-Alignment-Based Segment-Level Machine Translation Evaluation using\n  Word Embeddings", "abstract": "One of the most important problems in machine translation (MT) evaluation is\nto evaluate the similarity between translation hypotheses with different\nsurface forms from the reference, especially at the segment level. We propose\nto use word embeddings to perform word alignment for segment-level MT\nevaluation. We performed experiments with three types of alignment methods\nusing word embeddings. We evaluated our proposed methods with various\ntranslation datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed methods\noutperform previous word embeddings-based methods.", "published": "2017-04-02 22:36:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00380v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
