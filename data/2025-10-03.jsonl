{"title": "Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward", "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large\nLanguage Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by\na training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,\nsignaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence.

We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space.

During token\ngeneration, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify\nhigh-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific\ncorrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a\nself-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By\nretrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more\ntrustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors\nat highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model\nreasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger\nself-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on\nPass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a\nplug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for\nreliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and\nbroad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,\nSLOT) techniques.", "published": "2025-10-03 11:46:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet.

We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud.

Though treatments, such as\nanti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the\ndegenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision\nloss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD\nor AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to\nreduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,\ndeep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and\nGradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in\ndistinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI\ndriven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists\nregarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works\nmostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying\ncausal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific\nfactors or even lead to less reliable decisions.

However, most production\nworkloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most\nresearch systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in\ncompression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific\ncompressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of\nthe data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best\ngeneric compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not\nwithout drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are\ndifficult to maintain and deploy.\n  We show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking\nabout compression. We propose the ``graph model'' of compression, a new\ntheoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph\nof modular codecs. This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that\ncompresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which\ncan be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid\ndevelopment of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder\neliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard\ncomponent library minimizes security risks.

In this work, we introduce CVSM (Contrastive Vocal Similarity\nModeling), a contrastive self-supervised procedure for music signal\nrepresentation learning in the audio domain that can be utilized for musical\nand vocal similarity modeling. Our method operates under a contrastive\nframework, maximizing the similarity between vocal excerpts and musical\nmixtures containing the same vocals; we devise both a label-informed protocol,\nleveraging artist identity information to sample the contrastive pairs, and a\nlabel-agnostic scheme, involving artificial mixture creation from randomly\nsampled vocal and accompaniment excerpts, which are paired with vocals from the\nsame audio segment. We evaluate our proposed method in measuring vocal\nsimilarity both objectively, through linear probing on a suite of appropriate\ndownstream tasks, and subjectively, via conducting a user study consisting of\npairwise comparisons between different models in a recommendation-by-query\nsetting. Our results indicate that the representations learned through CVSM are\neffective in musical and vocal similarity modeling, outperforming numerous\nbaselines across both isolated vocals and complete musical mixtures. Moreover,\nwhile the availability of artist identity labels during pre-training leads to\noverall more consistent performance both in the evaluated downstream tasks and\nthe user study, a label-agnostic CVSM variant incorporating hybrid pre-training\nwith real and artificial mixtures achieves comparable performance to the\nlabel-informed one in artist identification and perceived vocal similarity.", "published": "2025-10-03 14:07:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03025v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
