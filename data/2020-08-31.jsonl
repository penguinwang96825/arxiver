{"title": "Mapping Researchers with PeopleMap", "abstract": "Discovering research expertise at universities can be a difficult task. Directories routinely become outdated, and few help in visually summarizing researchers' work or supporting the exploration of shared interests among researchers. This results in lost opportunities for both internal and external entities to discover new connections, nurture research collaboration, and explore the diversity of research. To address this problem, at Georgia Tech, we have been developing PeopleMap, an open-source interactive web-based tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to create visual maps for researchers based on their research interests and publications. Requiring only the researchers' Google Scholar profiles as input, PeopleMap generates and visualizes embeddings for the researchers, significantly reducing the need for manual curation of publication information. To encourage and facilitate easy adoption and extension of PeopleMap, we have open-sourced it under the permissive MIT license at https://github.com/poloclub/people-map. PeopleMap has received positive feedback and enthusiasm for expanding its adoption across Georgia Tech.", "published": "2020-08-31 20:46:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00091v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
{"title": "A Finite-Time Technological Singularity Model With Artificial Intelligence Self-Improvement", "abstract": "Recent advances in the development of artificial intelligence, technological progress acceleration, long-term trends of macroeconomic dynamics increase the relevance of technological singularity hypothesis. In this paper, we build a model of finite-time technological singularity assuming that artificial intelligence will replace humans for artificial intelligence engineers after some point in time when it is developed enough. This model implies the following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then, the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and compare. Subsequently, we also add a stochastic term (Brownian motion) to the model and investigate the changes in its behavior. The results can be applied for the modeling of dynamics of various processes characterized by multiplicative growth.", "published": "2020-08-31 15:29:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01961v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Biased Opinion Dynamics: When the Devil Is in the Details", "abstract": "We investigate opinion dynamics in multi-agent networks when a bias toward one of two possible opinions exists; for example, reflecting a status quo vs a superior alternative. Starting with all agents sharing an initial opinion representing the status quo, the system evolves in steps. In each step, one agent selected uniformly at random adopts the superior opinion with some probability $\u03b1$, and with probability $1 - \u03b1$ it follows an underlying update rule to revise its opinion on the basis of those held by its neighbors. We analyze convergence of the resulting process under two well-known update rules, namely majority and voter. The framework we propose exhibits a rich structure, with a non-obvious interplay between topology and underlying update rule. For example, for the voter rule we show that the speed of convergence bears no significant dependence on the underlying topology, whereas the picture changes completely under the majority rule, where network density negatively affects convergence. We believe that the model we propose is at the same time simple, rich, and modular, affording mathematical characterization of the interplay between bias, underlying opinion dynamics, and social structure in a unified setting.", "published": "2020-08-31 13:22:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13589v2", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Random Forest (RF) Kernel for Regression, Classification and Survival", "abstract": "Breiman's random forest (RF) can be interpreted as an implicit kernel generator,where the ensuing proximity matrix represents the data-driven RF kernel. Kernel perspective on the RF has been used to develop a principled framework for theoretical investigation of its statistical properties. However, practical utility of the links between kernels and the RF has not been widely explored and systematically evaluated.Focus of our work is investigation of the interplay between kernel methods and the RF. We elucidate the performance and properties of the data driven RF kernels used by regularized linear models in a comprehensive simulation study comprising of continuous, binary and survival targets. We show that for continuous and survival targets, the RF kernels are competitive to RF in higher dimensional scenarios with larger number of noisy features. For the binary target, the RF kernel and RF exhibit comparable performance. As the RF kernel asymptotically converges to the Laplace kernel, we included it in our evaluation. For most simulation setups, the RF and RFkernel outperformed the Laplace kernel. Nevertheless, in some cases the Laplace kernel was competitive, showing its potential value for applications. We also provide the results from real life data sets for the regression, classification and survival to illustrate how these insights may be leveraged in practice.Finally, we discuss further extensions of the RF kernels in the context of interpretable prototype and landmarking classification, regression and survival. We outline future line of research for kernels furnished by Bayesian counterparts of the RF.", "published": "2020-08-31 20:21:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00089v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
