{"title": "A Parallel Corpus of Theses and Dissertations Abstracts", "abstract": "In Brazil, the governmental body responsible for overseeing and coordinating\npost-graduate programs, CAPES, keeps records of all theses and dissertations\npresented in the country. Information regarding such documents can be accessed\nonline in the Theses and Dissertations Catalog (TDC), which contains abstracts\nin Portuguese and English, and additional metadata. Thus, this database can be\na potential source of parallel corpora for the Portuguese and English\nlanguages. In this article, we present the development of a parallel corpus\nfrom TDC, which is made available by CAPES under the open data initiative.\nApproximately 240,000 documents were collected and aligned using the Hunalign\ntool. We demonstrate the capability of our developed corpus by training\nStatistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT)\nmodels for both language directions, followed by a comparison with Google\nTranslate (GT). Both translation models presented better BLEU scores than GT,\nwith NMT system being the most accurate one. Sentence alignment was also\nmanually evaluated, presenting an average of 82.30% correctly aligned\nsentences. Our parallel corpus is freely available in TMX format, with\ncomplementary information regarding document metadata", "published": "2019-05-05 16:53:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01715v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "HHMM at SemEval-2019 Task 2: Unsupervised Frame Induction using\n  Contextualized Word Embeddings", "abstract": "We present our system for semantic frame induction that showed the best\nperformance in Subtask B.1 and finished as the runner-up in Subtask A of the\nSemEval 2019 Task 2 on unsupervised semantic frame induction (QasemiZadeh et\nal., 2019). Our approach separates this task into two independent steps: verb\nclustering using word and their context embeddings and role labeling by\ncombining these embeddings with syntactical features. A simple combination of\nthese steps shows very competitive results and can be extended to process other\ndatasets and languages.", "published": "2019-05-05 19:57:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01739v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "BVS Corpus: A Multilingual Parallel Corpus of Biomedical Scientific\n  Texts", "abstract": "The BVS database (Health Virtual Library) is a centralized source of\nbiomedical information for Latin America and Carib, created in 1998 and\ncoordinated by BIREME (Biblioteca Regional de Medicina) in agreement with the\nPan American Health Organization (OPAS). Abstracts are available in English,\nSpanish, and Portuguese, with a subset in more than one language, thus being a\npossible source of parallel corpora. In this article, we present the\ndevelopment of parallel corpora from BVS in three languages: English,\nPortuguese, and Spanish. Sentences were automatically aligned using the\nHunalign algorithm for EN/ES and EN/PT language pairs, and for a subset of\ntrilingual articles also. We demonstrate the capabilities of our corpus by\ntraining a Neural Machine Translation (OpenNMT) system for each language pair,\nwhich outperformed related works on scientific biomedical articles. Sentence\nalignment was also manually evaluated, presenting an average 96% of correctly\naligned sentences across all languages. Our parallel corpus is freely\navailable, with complementary information regarding article metadata.", "published": "2019-05-05 16:18:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01712v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Investigating the Successes and Failures of BERT for Passage Re-Ranking", "abstract": "The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model has\nrecently advanced the state-of-the-art in passage re-ranking. In this paper, we\nanalyze the results produced by a fine-tuned BERT model to better understand\nthe reasons behind such substantial improvements. To this aim, we focus on the\nMS MARCO passage re-ranking dataset and provide potential reasons for the\nsuccesses and failures of BERT for retrieval. In more detail, we empirically\nstudy a set of hypotheses and provide additional analysis to explain the\nsuccessful performance of BERT.", "published": "2019-05-05 22:16:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01758v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A Typedriven Vector Semantics for Ellipsis with Anaphora using Lambek\n  Calculus with Limited Contraction", "abstract": "We develop a vector space semantics for verb phrase ellipsis with anaphora\nusing type-driven compositional distributional semantics based on the Lambek\ncalculus with limited contraction (LCC) of J\\\"ager (2006). Distributional\nsemantics has a lot to say about the statistical collocation-based meanings of\ncontent words, but provides little guidance on how to treat function words.\nFormal semantics on the other hand, has powerful mechanisms for dealing with\nrelative pronouns, coordinators, and the like. Type-driven compositional\ndistributional semantics brings these two models together. We review previous\ncompositional distributional models of relative pronouns, coordination and a\nrestricted account of ellipsis in the DisCoCat framework of Coecke et al.\n(2010, 2013). We show how DisCoCat cannot deal with general forms of ellipsis,\nwhich rely on copying of information, and develop a novel way of connecting\ntypelogical grammar to distributional semantics by assigning vector\ninterpretable lambda terms to derivations of LCC in the style of Muskens &\nSadrzadeh (2016). What follows is an account of (verb phrase) ellipsis in which\nword meanings can be copied: the meaning of a sentence is now a program with\nnon-linear access to individual word embeddings. We present the theoretical\nsetting, work out examples, and demonstrate our results on a toy distributional\nmodel motivated by data.", "published": "2019-05-05 10:30:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01647v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LO", "math.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
