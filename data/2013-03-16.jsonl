{"title": "An Adaptive Methodology for Ubiquitous ASR System", "abstract": "Achieving and maintaining the performance of ubiquitous (Automatic Speech\nRecognition) ASR system is a real challenge. The main objective of this work is\nto develop a method that will improve and show the consistency in performance\nof ubiquitous ASR system for real world noisy environment. An adaptive\nmethodology has been developed to achieve an objective with the help of\nimplementing followings, -Cleaning speech signal as much as possible while\npreserving originality / intangibility using various modified filters and\nenhancement techniques. -Extracting features from speech signals using various\nsizes of parameter. -Train the system for ubiquitous environment using\nmulti-environmental adaptation training methods. -Optimize the word recognition\nrate with appropriate variable size of parameters using fuzzy technique. The\nconsistency in performance is tested using standard noise databases as well as\nin real world environment. A good improvement is noticed. This work will be\nhelpful to give discriminative training of ubiquitous ASR system for better\nHuman Computer Interaction (HCI) using Speech User Interface (SUI).", "published": "2013-03-16 05:35:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3948v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
