{"title": "Energy-Optimal Goal Assignment of Multi-Agent System with Goal Trajectories in Polynomials", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach for solving an energy-optimal goal assignment problem to generate the desired formation in multi-agent systems. Each agent solves a decentralized optimization problem with only local information about its neighboring agents and the goals. The optimization problem consists of two sub-problems. The first problem seeks to minimize the energy for each agent to reach certain goals, while the second problem entreats an optimal combination of goal and agent pairs that minimizes the energy cost. By assuming the goal trajectories are given in a polynomial form, we prove the solution to the formulated problem exists globally. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through the simulation.", "published": "2021-01-15 20:03:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06288v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Least Squares Monte Carlo applied to Dynamic Monetary Utility Functions", "abstract": "In this paper we explore ways of numerically computing recursive dynamic monetary risk measures and utility functions. Computationally, this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality and nested simulations are unfeasible if there are more than two time steps. The approach considered in this paper is to use a Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm to tackle this problem, a method which has been primarily considered for valuing American derivatives, or more general stopping time problems, as these also give rise to backward recursions with corresponding challenges in terms of numerical computation. We give some overarching consistency results for the LSM algorithm in a general setting as well as explore numerically its performance for recursive Cost-of-Capital valuation, a special case of a dynamic monetary utility function.", "published": "2021-01-15 10:44:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10947v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.PR", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
