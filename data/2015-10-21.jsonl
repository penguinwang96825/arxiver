{"title": "Part-of-Speech Tagging with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory\n  Recurrent Neural Network", "abstract": "Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM-RNN) has\nbeen shown to be very effective for tagging sequential data, e.g. speech\nutterances or handwritten documents. While word embedding has been demoed as a\npowerful representation for characterizing the statistical properties of\nnatural language. In this study, we propose to use BLSTM-RNN with word\nembedding for part-of-speech (POS) tagging task. When tested on Penn Treebank\nWSJ test set, a state-of-the-art performance of 97.40 tagging accuracy is\nachieved. Without using morphological features, this approach can also achieve\na good performance comparable with the Stanford POS tagger.", "published": "2015-10-21 08:57:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06168v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Prevalence and recoverability of syntactic parameters in sparse\n  distributed memories", "abstract": "We propose a new method, based on Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva\nNetworks), for studying dependency relations between different syntactic\nparameters in the Principles and Parameters model of Syntax. We store data of\nsyntactic parameters of world languages in a Kanerva Network and we check the\nrecoverability of corrupted parameter data from the network. We find that\ndifferent syntactic parameters have different degrees of recoverability. We\nidentify two different effects: an overall underlying relation between the\nprevalence of parameters across languages and their degree of recoverability,\nand a finer effect that makes some parameters more easily recoverable beyond\nwhat their prevalence would indicate. We interpret a higher recoverability for\na syntactic parameter as an indication of the existence of a dependency\nrelation, through which the given parameter can be determined using the\nremaining uncorrupted data.", "published": "2015-10-21 17:11:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06342v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "91F20"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
