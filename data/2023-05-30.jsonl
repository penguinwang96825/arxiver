{"title": "The union-closed sets conjecture for non-uniform distributions", "abstract": "The union-closed sets conjecture, attributed to P\u00e9ter Frankl from 1979, states that for any non-empty finite union-closed family of finite sets not consisting of only the empty set, there is an element that is in at least half of the sets in the family. We prove a version of Frankl's conjecture for families distributed according to any one of infinitely many distributions. As a corollary, in the intersection-closed reformulation of Frankl's conjecture, we obtain that it is true for families distributed according to any one of infinitely many Maxwell--Boltzmann distributions with inverse temperatures bounded below by a positive universal constant. Frankl's original conjecture corresponds to zero inverse temperature.", "published": "2023-05-30 18:04:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19338v2", "categories": ["math.CO", "cs.IT", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "math.CO"}
