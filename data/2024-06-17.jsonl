{"title": "Circular transformation of the European steel industry renders scrap metal a strategic resource", "abstract": "The steel industry is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, accounting for 7%\nof global emissions. The European steel industry is seeking to reduce its\nemissions by increasing the use of electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which can\nproduce steel from scrap, marking a major shift towards a circular steel\neconomy. Here, we show by combining trade with business intelligence data that\nthis shift requires a deep restructuring of the global and European scrap\ntrade, as well as a substantial scaling of the underlying business ecosystem.\nWe find that the scrap imports of European countries with major EAF\ninstallations have steadily decreased since 2007 while globally scrap trade\nstarted to increase recently. Our statistical modelling shows that every 1,000\ntonnes of EAF capacity installed is associated with an increase in annual\nimports of 550 tonnes and a decrease in annual exports of 1,000 tonnes of\nscrap, suggesting increased competition for scrap metal as countries ramp up\ntheir EAF capacity. Furthermore, each scrap company enables an increase of\naround 79,000 tonnes of EAF-based steel production per year in the EU. Taking\nthese relations as causal and extrapolating to the currently planned EAF\ncapacity, we find that an additional 730 (SD 140) companies might be required,\nemploying about 35,000 people (IQR 29,000-50,000) and generating an additional\nestimated turnover of USD 35 billion (IQR 27-48). Our results thus suggest that\nscrap metal is likely to become a strategic resource. They highlight the need\nfor a massive restructuring of the industry's supply networks and identify the\nresulting growth opportunities for companies.", "published": "2024-06-17 21:21:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12098v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
