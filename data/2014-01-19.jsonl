{"title": "The Capacity of String-Replication Systems", "abstract": "It is known that the majority of the human genome consists of repeated\nsequences. Furthermore, it is believed that a significant part of the rest of\nthe genome also originated from repeated sequences and has mutated to its\ncurrent form. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of constructing an\nexponentially large number of sequences from a short initial sequence and\nsimple replication rules, including those resembling genomic replication\nprocesses. In other words, our goal is to find out the capacity, or the\nexpressive power, of these string-replication systems. Our results include\nexact capacities, and bounds on the capacities, of four fundamental\nstring-replication systems.", "published": "2014-01-19 03:57:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4634v1", "categories": ["cs.IT", "cs.CL", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}
