{"title": "SimArch: A Multi-agent System For Human Path Simulation In Architecture Design", "abstract": "Human moving path is an important feature in architecture design. By studying the path, architects know where to arrange the basic elements (e.g. structures, glasses, furniture, etc.) in the space. This paper presents SimArch, a multi-agent system for human moving path simulation. It involves a behavior model built by using a Markov Decision Process. The model simulates human mental states, target range detection, and collision prediction when agents are on the floor, in a particular small gallery, looking at an exhibit, or leaving the floor. It also models different kinds of human characteristics by assigning different transition probabilities. A modified weighted A* search algorithm quickly plans the sub-optimal path of the agents. In an experiment, SimArch takes a series of preprocessed floorplans as inputs, simulates the moving path, and outputs a density map for evaluation. The density map provides the prediction that how likely a person will occur in a location. A following discussion illustrates how architects can use the density map to improve their floorplan design.", "published": "2018-07-10 17:04:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03760v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Is Q-learning Provably Efficient?", "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Q-learning, directly parameterize and update value functions or policies without explicitly modeling the environment. They are typically simpler, more flexible to use, and thus more prevalent in modern deep RL than model-based approaches. However, empirical work has suggested that model-free algorithms may require more samples to learn [Deisenroth and Rasmussen 2011, Schulman et al. 2015]. The theoretical question of \"whether model-free algorithms can be made sample efficient\" is one of the most fundamental questions in RL, and remains unsolved even in the basic scenario with finitely many states and actions.\n  We prove that, in an episodic MDP setting, Q-learning with UCB exploration achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{H^3 SAT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, $H$ is the number of steps per episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. This sample efficiency matches the optimal regret that can be achieved by any model-based approach, up to a single $\\sqrt{H}$ factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis in the model-free setting that establishes $\\sqrt{T}$ regret without requiring access to a \"simulator.\"", "published": "2018-07-10 17:21:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03765v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "math.OC", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Deep Structured Generative Models", "abstract": "Deep generative models have shown promising results in generating realistic images, but it is still non-trivial to generate images with complicated structures. The main reason is that most of the current generative models fail to explore the structures in the images including spatial layout and semantic relations between objects. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep structured generative model which boosts generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the aid of structure information. In particular, the layout or structure of the scene is encoded by a stochastic and-or graph (sAOG), in which the terminal nodes represent single objects and edges represent relations between objects. With the sAOG appropriately harnessed, our model can successfully capture the intrinsic structure in the scenes and generate images of complicated scenes accordingly. Furthermore, a detection network is introduced to infer scene structures from a image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both modeling the intrinsic structures, and generating realistic images.", "published": "2018-07-10 21:45:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03877v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Handling Incomplete Heterogeneous Data using VAEs", "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs), as well as other generative models, have been shown to be efficient and accurate for capturing the latent structure of vast amounts of complex high-dimensional data. However, existing VAEs can still not directly handle data that are heterogenous (mixed continuous and discrete) or incomplete (with missing data at random), which is indeed common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a general framework to design VAEs suitable for fitting incomplete heterogenous data. The proposed HI-VAE includes likelihood models for real-valued, positive real valued, interval, categorical, ordinal and count data, and allows accurate estimation (and potentially imputation) of missing data. Furthermore, HI-VAE presents competitive predictive performance in supervised tasks, outperforming supervised models when trained on incomplete data.", "published": "2018-07-10 14:00:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03653v4", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
