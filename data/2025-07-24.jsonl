This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that\nintegrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations\nwithin a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted\nattacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits\nclassification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed\nvisual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,\nhelping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.", "published": "2025-07-24 02:04:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

There are\nstrong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned\nreinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a\nlarge number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each\ntest episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that\nperformance can be substantially improved through test-time training,\nspecializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time\noffline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead\nto substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel\nself-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an\noffline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality\nwith respect to the evaluation goal.

As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems.

While LLMs can generate syntactically correct\nsolutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with\nchallenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to\ndiverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or\nself-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to\naccumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.\n  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework\nthat enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past\nfixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores\nsuccessful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor\nAgent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and\nrefining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that\nguides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public\nbenchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem\ncomplexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms\nboth zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging\nfrom 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.", "published": "2025-07-24 21:23:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
