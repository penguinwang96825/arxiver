{"title": "Estimating Phoneme Class Conditional Probabilities from Raw Speech\n  Signal using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "In hybrid hidden Markov model/artificial neural networks (HMM/ANN) automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) system, the phoneme class conditional probabilities\nare estimated by first extracting acoustic features from the speech signal\nbased on prior knowledge such as, speech perception or/and speech production\nknowledge, and, then modeling the acoustic features with an ANN. Recent\nadvances in machine learning techniques, more specifically in the field of\nimage processing and text processing, have shown that such divide and conquer\nstrategy (i.e., separating feature extraction and modeling steps) may not be\nnecessary. Motivated from these studies, in the framework of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), this paper investigates a novel approach, where the\ninput to the ANN is raw speech signal and the output is phoneme class\nconditional probability estimates. On TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we study\ndifferent ANN architectures to show the benefit of CNNs and compare the\nproposed approach against conventional approach where, spectral-based feature\nMFCC is extracted and modeled by a multilayer perceptron. Our studies show that\nthe proposed approach can yield comparable or better phoneme recognition\nperformance when compared to the conventional approach. It indicates that CNNs\ncan learn features relevant for phoneme classification automatically from the\nraw speech signal.", "published": "2013-04-03 17:20:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1018v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
