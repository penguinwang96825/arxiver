{"title": "Generating Memorable Mnemonic Encodings of Numbers", "abstract": "The major system is a mnemonic system that can be used to memorize sequences\nof numbers. In this work, we present a method to automatically generate\nsentences that encode a given number.

The results\nof the study show that a model combining part-of-speech sentence templates with\nan $n$-gram language model produces the most memorable password\nrepresentations.", "published": "2017-05-07 21:16:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02700v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "People on Media: Jointly Identifying Credible News and Trustworthy\n  Citizen Journalists in Online Communities", "abstract": "Media seems to have become more partisan, often providing a biased coverage\nof news catering to the interest of specific groups. It is therefore essential\nto identify credible information content that provides an objective narrative\nof an event. News communities such as digg, reddit, or newstrust offer\nrecommendations, reviews, quality ratings, and further insights on journalistic\nworks. However, there is a complex interaction between different factors in\nsuch online communities: fairness and style of reporting, language clarity and\nobjectivity, topical perspectives (like political viewpoint), expertise and\nbias of community members, and more. This paper presents a model to\nsystematically analyze the different interactions in a news community between\nusers, news, and sources. We develop a probabilistic graphical model that\nleverages this joint interaction to identify 1) highly credible news articles,\n2) trustworthy news sources, and 3) expert users who perform the role of\n\"citizen journalists\" in the community. Our method extends CRF models to\nincorporate real-valued ratings, as some communities have very fine-grained\nscales that cannot be easily discretized without losing information. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this paper is the first full-fledged analysis of\ncredibility, trust, and expertise in news communities.", "published": "2017-05-07 17:41:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02667v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Credible Review Detection with Limited Information using Consistency\n  Analysis", "abstract": "Online reviews provide viewpoints on the strengths and shortcomings of\nproducts/services, influencing potential customers' purchasing decisions.\nHowever, the proliferation of non-credible reviews -- either fake (promoting/\ndemoting an item), incompetent (involving irrelevant aspects), or biased --\nentails the problem of identifying credible reviews. Prior works involve\nclassifiers harnessing rich information about items/users -- which might not be\nreadily available in several domains -- that provide only limited\ninterpretability as to why a review is deemed non-credible. This paper presents\na novel approach to address the above issues. We utilize latent topic models\nleveraging review texts, item ratings, and timestamps to derive consistency\nfeatures without relying on item/user histories, unavailable for \"long-tail\"\nitems/users. We develop models, for computing review credibility scores to\nprovide interpretable evidence for non-credible reviews, that are also\ntransferable to other domains -- addressing the scarcity of labeled data.\nExperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate improvements over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.", "published": "2017-05-07 17:43:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02668v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Item Recommendation with Continuous Experience Evolution of Users using\n  Brownian Motion", "abstract": "Online review communities are dynamic as users join and leave, adopt new\nvocabulary, and adapt to evolving trends. Recent work has shown that\nrecommender systems benefit from explicit consideration of user experience.\nHowever, prior work assumes a fixed number of discrete experience levels,\nwhereas in reality users gain experience and mature continuously over time.\nThis paper presents a new model that captures the continuous evolution of user\nexperience, and the resulting language model in reviews and other posts. Our\nmodel is unsupervised and combines principles of Geometric Brownian Motion,\nBrownian Motion, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to trace a smooth temporal\nprogression of user experience and language model respectively. We develop\npractical algorithms for estimating the model parameters from data and for\ninference with our model (e.g., to recommend items). Extensive experiments with\nfive real-world datasets show that our model not only fits data better than\ndiscrete-model baselines, but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods for\npredicting item ratings.", "published": "2017-05-07 17:46:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02669v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
