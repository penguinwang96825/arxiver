{"title": "Bilingual Distributed Word Representations from Document-Aligned\n  Comparable Data", "abstract": "We propose a new model for learning bilingual word representations from\nnon-parallel document-aligned data. Following the recent advances in word\nrepresentation learning, our model learns dense real-valued word vectors, that\nis, bilingual word embeddings (BWEs). Unlike prior work on inducing BWEs which\nheavily relied on parallel sentence-aligned corpora and/or readily available\ntranslation resources such as dictionaries, the article reveals that BWEs may\nbe learned solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data without any\nadditional lexical resources nor syntactic information. We present a comparison\nof our approach with previous state-of-the-art models for learning bilingual\nword representations from comparable data that rely on the framework of\nmultilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM), as well as with\ndistributional local context-counting models. We demonstrate the utility of the\ninduced BWEs in two semantic tasks: (1) bilingual lexicon extraction, (2)\nsuggesting word translations in context for polysemous words. Our simple yet\neffective BWE-based models significantly outperform the MuPTM-based and\ncontext-counting representation models from comparable data as well as prior\nBWE-based models, and acquire the best reported results on both tasks for all\nthree tested language pairs.", "published": "2015-09-24 11:00:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07308v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Description of the Odin Event Extraction Framework and Rule Language", "abstract": "This document describes the Odin framework, which is a domain-independent\nplatform for developing rule-based event extraction models. Odin aims to be\npowerful (the rule language allows the modeling of complex syntactic\nstructures) and robust (to recover from syntactic parsing errors, syntactic\npatterns can be freely mixed with surface, token-based patterns), while\nremaining simple (some domain grammars can be up and running in minutes), and\nfast (Odin processes over 100 sentences/second in a real-world domain with over\n200 rules). Here we include a thorough definition of the Odin rule language,\ntogether with a description of the Odin API in the Scala language, which allows\none to apply these rules to arbitrary texts.", "published": "2015-09-24 20:10:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07513v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Noise-Robust ASR for the third 'CHiME' Challenge Exploiting\n  Time-Frequency Masking based Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement and Recurrent\n  Neural Network", "abstract": "In this paper, the Lingban entry to the third 'CHiME' speech separation and\nrecognition challenge is presented. A time-frequency masking based speech\nenhancement front-end is proposed to suppress the environmental noise utilizing\nmulti-channel coherence and spatial cues. The state-of-the-art speech\nrecognition techniques, namely recurrent neural network based acoustic and\nlanguage modeling, state space minimum Bayes risk based discriminative acoustic\nmodeling, and i-vector based acoustic condition modeling, are carefully\nintegrated into the speech recognition back-end. To further improve the system\nperformance by fully exploiting the advantages of different technologies, the\nfinal recognition results are obtained by lattice combination and rescoring.\nEvaluations carried out on the official dataset prove the effectiveness of the\nproposed systems. Comparing with the best baseline result, the proposed system\nobtains consistent improvements with over 57% relative word error rate\nreduction on the real-data test set.", "published": "2015-09-24 02:16:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07211v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
