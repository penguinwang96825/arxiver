In fact,\nthis protocol was the main source of inspiration for this algorithm which has\nmany applications in the area of Natural Language Processing.", "published": "2013-05-02 18:49:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0556v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "quant-ph", "68T50", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
