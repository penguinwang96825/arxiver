{"title": "Is getting the right answer just about choosing the right words? The\n  role of syntactically-informed features in short answer scoring", "abstract": "Developments in the educational landscape have spurred greater interest in\nthe problem of automatically scoring short answer questions. A recent shared\ntask on this topic revealed a fundamental divide in the modeling approaches\nthat have been applied to this problem, with the best-performing systems split\nbetween those that employ a knowledge engineering approach and those that\nalmost solely leverage lexical information (as opposed to higher-level\nsyntactic information) in assigning a score to a given response. This paper\naims to introduce the NLP community to the largest corpus currently available\nfor short-answer scoring, provide an overview of methods used in the shared\ntask using this data, and explore the extent to which more\nsyntactically-informed features can contribute to the short answer scoring task\nin a way that avoids the question-specific manual effort of the knowledge\nengineering approach.", "published": "2014-03-04 14:45:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0801v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
