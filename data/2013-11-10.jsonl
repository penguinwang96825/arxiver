{"title": "Semantic Sort: A Supervised Approach to Personalized Semantic\n  Relatedness", "abstract": "We propose and study a novel supervised approach to learning statistical\nsemantic relatedness models from subjectively annotated training examples. The\nproposed semantic model consists of parameterized co-occurrence statistics\nassociated with textual units of a large background knowledge corpus. We\npresent an efficient algorithm for learning such semantic models from a\ntraining sample of relatedness preferences. Our method is corpus independent\nand can essentially rely on any sufficiently large (unstructured) collection of\ncoherent texts. Moreover, the approach facilitates the fitting of semantic\nmodels for specific users or groups of users. We present the results of\nextensive range of experiments from small to large scale, indicating that the\nproposed method is effective and competitive with the state-of-the-art.", "published": "2013-11-10 09:15:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2252v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
