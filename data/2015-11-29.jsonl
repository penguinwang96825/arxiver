{"title": "Bootstrapping Ternary Relation Extractors", "abstract": "Binary relation extraction methods have been widely studied in recent years.\nHowever, few methods have been developed for higher n-ary relation extraction.\nOne limiting factor is the effort required to generate training data. For\nbinary relations, one only has to provide a few dozen pairs of entities per\nrelation, as training data. For ternary relations (n=3), each training instance\nis a triplet of entities, placing a greater cognitive load on people. For\nexample, many people know that Google acquired Youtube but not the dollar\namount or the date of the acquisition and many people know that Hillary Clinton\nis married to Bill Clinton by not the location or date of their wedding. This\nmakes higher n-nary training data generation a time consuming exercise in\nsearching the Web. We present a resource for training ternary relation\nextractors. This was generated using a minimally supervised yet effective\napproach. We present statistics on the size and the quality of the dataset.", "published": "2015-11-29 00:49:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08952v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Machine Learning Sentiment Prediction based on Hybrid Document\n  Representation", "abstract": "Automated sentiment analysis and opinion mining is a complex process\nconcerning the extraction of useful subjective information from text. The\nexplosion of user generated content on the Web, especially the fact that\nmillions of users, on a daily basis, express their opinions on products and\nservices to blogs, wikis, social networks, message boards, etc., render the\nreliable, automated export of sentiments and opinions from unstructured text\ncrucial for several commercial applications. In this paper, we present a novel\nhybrid vectorization approach for textual resources that combines a weighted\nvariant of the popular Word2Vec representation (based on Term Frequency-Inverse\nDocument Frequency) representation and with a Bag- of-Words representation and\na vector of lexicon-based sentiment values. The proposed text representation\napproach is assessed through the application of several machine learning\nclassification algorithms on a dataset that is used extensively in literature\nfor sentiment detection. The classification accuracy derived through the\nproposed hybrid vectorization approach is higher than when its individual\ncomponents are used for text represenation, and comparable with\nstate-of-the-art sentiment detection methodologies.", "published": "2015-11-29 22:41:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09107v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
