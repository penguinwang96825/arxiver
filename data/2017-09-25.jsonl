{"title": "Dataset for the First Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading\n  Comprehension", "abstract": "Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has become enormously popular recently\nand has attracted a lot of attention. However, existing reading comprehension\ndatasets are mostly in English. To add diversity in reading comprehension\ndatasets, in this paper we propose a new Chinese reading comprehension dataset\nfor accelerating related research in the community. The proposed dataset\ncontains two different types: cloze-style reading comprehension and user query\nreading comprehension, associated with large-scale training data as well as\nhuman-annotated validation and hidden test set. Along with this dataset, we\nalso hosted the first Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension\n(CMRC-2017) and successfully attracted tens of participants, which suggest the\npotential impact of this dataset.", "published": "2017-09-25 03:14:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08299v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Using objective words in the reviews to improve the colloquial arabic\n  sentiment analysis", "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in sentiment analysis of the Arabic language is\nthe presence of the colloquialism. In this paper, we examine the effect of\nusing objective words in conjunction with sentimental words on sentiment\nclassification for the colloquial Arabic reviews, specifically Jordanian\ncolloquial reviews. The reviews often include both sentimental and objective\nwords, however, the most existing sentiment analysis models ignore the\nobjective words as they are considered useless. In this work, we created two\nlexicons: the first includes the colloquial sentimental words and compound\nphrases, while the other contains the objective words associated with values of\nsentiment tendency based on a particular estimation method. We used these\nlexicons to extract sentiment features that would be training input to the\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the sentiment polarity of the\nreviews. The reviews dataset have been collected manually from JEERAN website.\nThe results of the experiments show that the proposed approach improves the\npolarity classification in comparison to two baseline models, with accuracy\n95.6%.", "published": "2017-09-25 14:40:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08521v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "DOC: Deep Open Classification of Text Documents", "abstract": "Traditional supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the\nclasses appeared in the test data must have appeared in training. This also\napplies to text learning or text classification. As learning is used\nincreasingly in dynamic open environments where some new/test documents may not\nbelong to any of the training classes, identifying these novel documents during\nclassification presents an important problem. This problem is called open-world\nclassification or open classification. This paper proposes a novel deep\nlearning based approach.

Many a times, such creativity is about adapting richness of one\ndomain into another to strike a chord with the target audience. In this\nresearch, we present PersuAIDE! - A persuasive system based on linguistic\ncreativity to transform given sentence to generate various forms of persuading\nsentences. These various forms cover multiple focus of persuasion such as\nmemorability and sentiment. For a given simple product line, the algorithm is\ncomposed of several steps including: (i) select an appropriate well-known\nexpression for the target domain to add memorability, (ii) identify keywords\nand entities in the given sentence and expression and transform it to produce\ncreative persuading sentence, and (iii) adding positive or negative sentiment\nfor further persuasion.

{"title": "Extracting Ontological Knowledge from Textual Descriptions", "abstract": "Authoring of OWL-DL ontologies is intellectually challenging and to make this\nprocess simpler, many systems accept natural language text as input. A\ntext-based ontology authoring approach can be successful only when it is\ncombined with an effective method for extracting ontological axioms from text.\nExtracting axioms from unrestricted English input is a substantially\nchallenging task due to the richness of the language. Controlled natural\nlanguages (CNLs) have been proposed in this context and these tend to be highly\nrestrictive. In this paper, we propose a new CNL called TEDEI (TExtual\nDEscription Identifier) whose grammar is inspired by the different ways OWL-DL\nconstructs are expressed in English. We built a system that transforms TEDEI\nsentences into corresponding OWL-DL axioms. Now, ambiguity due to different\npossible lexicalizations of sentences and semantic ambiguity present in\nsentences are challenges in this context. We find that the best way to handle\nthese challenges is to construct axioms corresponding to alternative\nformalizations of the sentence so that the end-user can make an appropriate\nchoice. The output is compared against human-authored axioms and in substantial\nnumber of cases, human-authored axiom is indeed one of the alternatives given\nby the system. The proposed system substantially enhances the types of sentence\nstructures that can be used for ontology authoring.", "published": "2017-09-25 12:22:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08448v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "EZLearn: Exploiting Organic Supervision in Large-Scale Data Annotation", "abstract": "Many real-world applications require automated data annotation, such as\nidentifying tissue origins based on gene expressions and classifying images\ninto semantic categories. Annotation classes are often numerous and subject to\nchanges over time, and annotating examples has become the major bottleneck for\nsupervised learning methods. In science and other high-value domains, large\nrepositories of data samples are often available, together with two sources of\norganic supervision: a lexicon for the annotation classes, and text\ndescriptions that accompany some data samples. Distant supervision has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for exploiting such indirect supervision by\nautomatically annotating examples where the text description contains a class\nmention in the lexicon. However, due to linguistic variations and ambiguities,\nsuch training data is inherently noisy, which limits the accuracy of this\napproach. In this paper, we introduce an auxiliary natural language processing\nsystem for the text modality, and incorporate co-training to reduce noise and\naugment signal in distant supervision. Without using any manually labeled data,\nour EZLearn system learned to accurately annotate data samples in functional\ngenomics and scientific figure comprehension, substantially outperforming\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods trained on tens of thousands of annotated\nexamples.", "published": "2017-09-25 17:10:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08600v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Context-Sensitive Convolutional Filters for Text Processing", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as a popular\nbuilding block for natural language processing (NLP). Despite their success,\nmost existing CNN models employed in NLP share the same learned (and static)\nset of filters for all input sentences. In this paper, we consider an approach\nof using a small meta network to learn context-sensitive convolutional filters\nfor text processing. The role of meta network is to abstract the contextual\ninformation of a sentence or document into a set of input-aware filters. We\nfurther generalize this framework to model sentence pairs, where a\nbidirectional filter generation mechanism is introduced to encapsulate\nco-dependent sentence representations. In our benchmarks on four different\ntasks, including ontology classification, sentiment analysis, answer sentence\nselection, and paraphrase identification, our proposed model, a modified CNN\nwith context-sensitive filters, consistently outperforms the standard CNN and\nattention-based CNN baselines. By visualizing the learned context-sensitive\nfilters, we further validate and rationalize the effectiveness of proposed\nframework.", "published": "2017-09-25 02:29:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08294v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Predicting interviewee attitude and body language from speech\n  descriptors", "abstract": "This present research investigated the relationship between personal\nimpressions and the acoustic nonverbal communication conveyed by employees\nbeing interviewed. First, we investigated the extent to which different\nconversation topics addressed during the interview induced changes in the\ninterviewees' acoustic parameters. Next, we attempted to predict the observed\nand self-assessed attitudes and body language of the interviewees based on the\nacoustic data. The results showed that topicality caused significant deviations\nin the acoustic parameters statistics, but the ability to predict the personal\nperceptions of the interviewees based on their acoustic non-verbal\ncommunication was relatively independent of topicality, due to the natural\nredundancy inherent in acoustic attributes. Our findings suggest that joint\nmodeling of speech and visual cues may improve the assessment of interviewee\nprofiles.", "published": "2017-09-25 06:52:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08344v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
