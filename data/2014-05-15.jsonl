These expand the range of possible uses of lexical data and support\nusers with more flexibility, for instance in assisting human translation. In\nthis article, we give a short and easy-to-understand introduction to the\nproblematic nature of the storage, display and interpretation of lexical data.\nWe then describe the main methods and specifications used to build and\nrepresent lexical data. This paper is targeted for the following groups of\npeople: linguists, lexicographers, IT specialists, computer linguists and all\nothers who wish to learn more about the modelling, representation and\nvisualization of lexical knowledge.

{"title": "Complex Networks Measures for Differentiation between Normal and\n  Shuffled Croatian Texts", "abstract": "This paper studies the properties of the Croatian texts via complex networks.\nWe present network properties of normal and shuffled Croatian texts for\ndifferent shuffling principles: on the sentence level and on the text level. In\nboth experiments we preserved the vocabulary size, word and sentence frequency\ndistributions. Additionally, in the first shuffling approach we preserved the\nsentence structure of the text and the number of words per sentence. Obtained\nresults showed that degree rank distributions exhibit no substantial deviation\nin shuffled networks, and strength rank distributions are preserved due to the\nsame word frequencies. Therefore, standard approach to study the structure of\nlinguistic co-occurrence networks showed no clear difference among the\ntopologies of normal and shuffled texts. Finally, we showed that the in- and\nout- selectivity values from shuffled texts are constantly below selectivity\nvalues calculated from normal texts. Our results corroborate that the node\nselectivity measure can capture structural differences between original and\nshuffled Croatian texts.", "published": "2014-05-15 09:51:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3786v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
