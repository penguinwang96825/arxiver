{"title": "Introduction to Solving Quant Finance Problems with Time-Stepped FBSDE and Deep Learning", "abstract": "In this introductory paper, we discuss how quantitative finance problems under some common risk factor dynamics for some common instruments and approaches can be formulated as time-continuous or time-discrete forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) final-value or control problems, how these final value problems can be turned into control problems, how time-continuous problems can be turned into time-discrete problems, and how the forward and backward stochastic differential equations (SDE) can be time-stepped. We obtain both forward and backward time-stepped time-discrete stochastic control problems (where forward and backward indicate in which direction the Y SDE is time-stepped) that we will solve with optimization approaches using deep neural networks for the controls and stochastic gradient and other deep learning methods for the actual optimization/learning. We close with examples for the forward and backward methods for an European option pricing problem. Several methods and approaches are new.", "published": "2019-11-27 15:45:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12231v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CE", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
