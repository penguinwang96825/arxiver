{"title": "An investigation into language complexity of World-of-Warcraft\n  game-external texts", "abstract": "We present a language complexity analysis of World of Warcraft (WoW)\ncommunity texts, which we compare to texts from a general corpus of web\nEnglish. Results from several complexity types are presented, including lexical\ndiversity, density, readability and syntactic complexity. The language of WoW\ntexts is found to be comparable to the general corpus on some complexity\nmeasures, yet more specialized on other measures. Our findings can be used by\neducators willing to include game-related activities into school curricula.", "published": "2015-02-07 21:59:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02655v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
