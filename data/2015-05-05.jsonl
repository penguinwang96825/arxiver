{"title": "Mining Measured Information from Text", "abstract": "We present an approach to extract measured information from text (e.g., a\n1370 degrees C melting point, a BMI greater than 29.9 kg/m^2 ). Such\nextractions are critically important across a wide range of domains -\nespecially those involving search and exploration of scientific and technical\ndocuments. We first propose a rule-based entity extractor to mine measured\nquantities (i.e., a numeric value paired with a measurement unit), which\nsupports a vast and comprehensive set of both common and obscure measurement\nunits. Our method is highly robust and can correctly recover valid measured\nquantities even when significant errors are introduced through the process of\nconverting document formats like PDF to plain text. Next, we describe an\napproach to extracting the properties being measured (e.g., the property \"pixel\npitch\" in the phrase \"a pixel pitch as high as 352 {\\mu}m\"). Finally, we\npresent MQSearch: the realization of a search engine with full support for\nmeasured information.", "published": "2015-05-05 16:36:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01072v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "I.2.7; H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Ask Your Neurons: A Neural-based Approach to Answering Questions about\n  Images", "abstract": "We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a\nVisual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and\nnatural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end\nformulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In\ncontrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the\nlanguage output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input\n(image and question). Our approach Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of\nthe previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into\nthe problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language\npart for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which\nis related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two\nnovel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR\ndataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.", "published": "2015-05-05 18:39:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01121v3", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
