{"title": "Generalized Factor Neural Network Model for High-dimensional Regression", "abstract": "We tackle the challenges of modeling high-dimensional data sets, particularly\nthose with latent low-dimensional structures hidden within complex, non-linear,\nand noisy relationships. Our approach enables a seamless integration of\nconcepts from non-parametric regression, factor models, and neural networks for\nhigh-dimensional regression. Our approach introduces PCA and Soft PCA layers,\nwhich can be embedded at any stage of a neural network architecture, allowing\nthe model to alternate between factor modeling and non-linear transformations.\nThis flexibility makes our method especially effective for processing\nhierarchical compositional data. We explore ours and other techniques for\nimposing low-rank structures on neural networks and examine how architectural\ndesign impacts model performance. The effectiveness of our method is\ndemonstrated through simulation studies, as well as applications to forecasting\nfuture price movements of equity ETF indices and nowcasting with macroeconomic\ndata.", "published": "2025-02-16 23:13:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11310v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST", "62G08, 68T07"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
