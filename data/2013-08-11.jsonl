{"title": "Hidden Structure and Function in the Lexicon", "abstract": "How many words are needed to define all the words in a dictionary?\nGraph-theoretic analysis reveals that about 10% of a dictionary is a unique\nKernel of words that define one another and all the rest, but this is not the\nsmallest such subset. The Kernel consists of one huge strongly connected\ncomponent (SCC), about half its size, the Core, surrounded by many small SCCs,\nthe Satellites. Core words can define one another but not the rest of the\ndictionary. The Kernel also contains many overlapping Minimal Grounding Sets\n(MGSs), each about the same size as the Core, each part-Core, part-Satellite.\nMGS words can define all the rest of the dictionary. They are learned earlier,\nmore concrete and more frequent than the rest of the dictionary. Satellite\nwords, not correlated with age or frequency, are less concrete (more abstract)\nwords that are also needed for full lexical power.", "published": "2013-08-11 20:50:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2428v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Exploratory Analysis of Highly Heterogeneous Document Collections", "abstract": "We present an effective multifaceted system for exploratory analysis of\nhighly heterogeneous document collections. Our system is based on intelligently\ntagging individual documents in a purely automated fashion and exploiting these\ntags in a powerful faceted browsing framework. Tagging strategies employed\ninclude both unsupervised and supervised approaches based on machine learning\nand natural language processing. As one of our key tagging strategies, we\nintroduce the KERA algorithm (Keyword Extraction for Reports and Articles).\nKERA extracts topic-representative terms from individual documents in a purely\nunsupervised fashion and is revealed to be significantly more effective than\nstate-of-the-art methods. Finally, we evaluate our system in its ability to\nhelp users locate documents pertaining to military critical technologies buried\ndeep in a large heterogeneous sea of information.", "published": "2013-08-11 02:28:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2359v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.IR", "I.2.7; H.3.3; H.5.2"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
