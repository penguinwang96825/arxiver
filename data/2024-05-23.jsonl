{"title": "FinRobot: An Open-Source AI Agent Platform for Financial Applications using Large Language Models", "abstract": "As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) into their workflows, substantial barriers, including\nproprietary data and specialized knowledge, persist between the finance sector\nand the AI community. These challenges impede the AI community's ability to\nenhance financial tasks effectively. Acknowledging financial analysis's\ncritical role, we aim to devise financial-specialized LLM-based toolchains and\ndemocratize access to them through open-source initiatives, promoting wider AI\nadoption in financial decision-making. In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a\nnovel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized\nAI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four\nmajor layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into\nlogical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures\nappropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and\nDataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning\ntechniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation\nModels layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to\naccess them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both\nprofessional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques\nfor advanced financial analysis.
