{"title": "On Semantic Word Cloud Representation", "abstract": "We study the problem of computing semantic-preserving word clouds in which\nsemantically related words are close to each other. While several heuristic\napproaches have been described in the literature, we formalize the underlying\ngeometric algorithm problem: Word Rectangle Adjacency Contact (WRAC). In this\nmodel each word is associated with rectangle with fixed dimensions, and the\ngoal is to represent semantically related words by ensuring that the two\ncorresponding rectangles touch. We design and analyze efficient polynomial-time\nalgorithms for some variants of the WRAC problem, show that several general\nvariants are NP-hard, and describe a number of approximation algorithms.\nFinally, we experimentally demonstrate that our theoretically-sound algorithms\noutperform the early heuristics.", "published": "2013-04-23 22:14:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.8016v1", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
