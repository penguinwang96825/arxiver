{"title": "Exploring Models and Data for Image Question Answering", "abstract": "This work aims to address the problem of image-based question-answering (QA)\nwith new models and datasets. In our work, we propose to use neural networks\nand visual semantic embeddings, without intermediate stages such as object\ndetection and image segmentation, to predict answers to simple questions about\nimages. Our model performs 1.8 times better than the only published results on\nan existing image QA dataset. We also present a question generation algorithm\nthat converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We\nused this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more\nevenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are\nalso presented.", "published": "2015-05-08 15:59:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02074v4", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
