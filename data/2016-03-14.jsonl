{"title": "Interactive Tools and Tasks for the Hebrew Bible", "abstract": "This contribution to a special issue on \"Computer-aided processing of\nintertextuality\" in ancient texts will illustrate how using digital tools to\ninteract with the Hebrew Bible offers new promising perspectives for\nvisualizing the texts and for performing tasks in education and research. This\ncontribution explores how the corpus of the Hebrew Bible created and maintained\nby the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer can support new methods for\nmodern knowledge workers within the field of digital humanities and theology be\napplied to ancient texts, and how this can be envisioned as a new field of\ndigital intertextuality. The article first describes how the corpus was used to\ndevelop the Bible Online Learner as a persuasive technology to enhance language\nlearning with, in, and around a database that acts as the engine driving\ninteractive tasks for learners. Intertextuality in this case is a matter of\nactive exploration and ongoing practice. Furthermore, interactive\ncorpus-technology has an important bearing on the task of textual criticism as\na specialized area of research that depends increasingly on the availability of\ndigital resources. Commercial solutions developed by software companies like\nLogos and Accordance offer a market-based intertextuality defined by the\nproduction of advanced digital resources for scholars and students as useful\nalternatives to often inaccessible and expensive printed versions. It is\nreasonable to expect that in the future interactive corpus technology will\nallow scholars to do innovative academic tasks in textual criticism and\ninterpretation. We have already seen the emergence of promising tools for text\ncategorization, analysis of translation shifts, and interpretation. Broadly\nspeaking, interactive tools and tasks within the three areas of language\nlearning, textual criticism, and Biblical studies illustrate a new kind of\nintertextuality emerging within digital humanities.", "published": "2016-03-14 12:33:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04236v5", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing Using Bidirectional LSTM Feature\n  Representations", "abstract": "We present a simple and effective scheme for dependency parsing which is\nbased on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each sentence token is associated with\na BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature\nvectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is\ntrained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature\nextractors for parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by\napplying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally\noptimized graph-based parser. The resulting parsers have very simple\narchitectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English\nand Chinese.", "published": "2016-03-14 17:18:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04351v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
