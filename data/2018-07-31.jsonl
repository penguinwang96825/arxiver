{"title": "Semantic DMN: Formalizing and Reasoning About Decisions in the Presence of Background Knowledge", "abstract": "The Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a recent OMG standard for the elicitation and representation of decision models, and for managing their interconnection with business processes. DMN builds on the notion of decision tables, and their combination into more complex decision requirements graphs (DRGs), which bridge between business process models and decision logic models. DRGs may rely on additional, external business knowledge models, whose functioning is not part of the standard. In this work, we consider one of the most important types of business knowledge, namely background knowledge that conceptually accounts for the structural aspects of the domain of interest, and propose decision knowledge bases (DKBs), which semantically combine DRGs modeled in DMN, and domain knowledge captured by means of first-order logic with datatypes. We provide a logic-based semantics for such an integration, and formalize different DMN reasoning tasks for DKBs. We then consider background knowledge formulated as a description logic ontology with datatypes, and show how the main verification tasks for DMN in this enriched setting can be formalized as standard DL reasoning services, and actually carried out in ExpTime. We discuss the effectiveness of our framework on a case study in maritime security.", "published": "2018-07-31 00:27:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11615v3", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Delay-Performance Tradeoffs in Causal Microphone Array Processing", "abstract": "In real-time listening enhancement applications, such as hearing aid signal processing, sounds must be processed with no more than a few milliseconds of delay to sound natural to the listener. Listening devices can achieve better performance with lower delay by using microphone arrays to filter acoustic signals in both space and time. Here, we analyze the tradeoff between delay and squared-error performance of causal multichannel Wiener filters for microphone array noise reduction. We compute exact expressions for the delay-error curves in two special cases and present experimental results from real-world microphone array recordings. We find that delay-performance characteristics are determined by both the spatial and temporal correlation structures of the signals.", "published": "2018-07-31 22:04:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00082v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Shared Spectrum for Mobile-Cells Backhaul and Access Link", "abstract": "Offloading cellular hotspot regions to small-cells has been the main theme for the fifth generation of cellular network. One such hotspot is the public transport which carries a large number of cellular users who frequently receive low quality of service (QoS) due to vehicular penetration effect (VPE). Hence installation of mobile-cell (MC) within public transport is seen as a potential enabler to enhance QoS for commuting users. However, unlike fixed cells, MC requires wireless backhaul (BH) connectivity along with in-vehicle Access-Link (AL) communication. These additional wireless links for MC communication will pose an excessive burden on an already scarce frequency spectrum. Hence, in this research, we exploit VPE and line-of-sight (LOS) communication to allow the downlink backhaul (DL-BH) sub-channels to be shared by in-vehicle downlink access-link (DL-AL) transmission. Our analysis and simulations show that using the above-mentioned technique, both links maintain high success probability, especially in regions with low signal to interference ratios.", "published": "2018-07-31 01:01:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11619v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
