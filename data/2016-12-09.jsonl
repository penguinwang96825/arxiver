{"title": "Evaluating Creative Language Generation: The Case of Rap Lyric\n  Ghostwriting", "abstract": "Language generation tasks that seek to mimic human ability to use language\ncreatively are difficult to evaluate, since one must consider creativity,\nstyle, and other non-trivial aspects of the generated text. The goal of this\npaper is to develop evaluation methods for one such task, ghostwriting of rap\nlyrics, and to provide an explicit, quantifiable foundation for the goals and\nfuture directions of this task. Ghostwriting must produce text that is similar\nin style to the emulated artist, yet distinct in content. We develop a novel\nevaluation methodology that addresses several complementary aspects of this\ntask, and illustrate how such evaluation can be used to meaningfully analyze\nsystem performance. We provide a corpus of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated\nfor stylistic similarity, which allows us to assess the feasibility of manual\nevaluation for generated verse.", "published": "2016-12-09 22:36:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03205v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "#HashtagWars: Learning a Sense of Humor", "abstract": "In this work, we present a new dataset for computational humor, specifically\ncomparative humor ranking, which attempts to eschew the ubiquitous binary\napproach to humor detection. The dataset consists of tweets that are humorous\nresponses to a given hashtag. We describe the motivation for this new dataset,\nas well as the collection process, which includes a description of our\nsemi-automated system for data collection. We also present initial experiments\nfor this dataset using both unsupervised and supervised approaches. Our best\nsupervised system achieved 63.7% accuracy, suggesting that this task is much\nmore difficult than comparable humor detection tasks. Initial experiments\nindicate that a character-level model is more suitable for this task than a\ntoken-level model, likely due to a large amount of puns that can be captured by\na character-level model.", "published": "2016-12-09 23:28:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03216v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
