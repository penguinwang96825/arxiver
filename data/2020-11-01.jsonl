{"title": "Generating Correct Answers for Progressive Matrices Intelligence Tests", "abstract": "Raven's Progressive Matrices are multiple-choice intelligence tests, where one tries to complete the missing location in a $3\\times 3$ grid of abstract images. Previous attempts to address this test have focused solely on selecting the right answer out of the multiple choices. In this work, we focus, instead, on generating a correct answer given the grid, without seeing the choices, which is a harder task, by definition. The proposed neural model combines multiple advances in generative models, including employing multiple pathways through the same network, using the reparameterization trick along two pathways to make their encoding compatible, a dynamic application of variational losses, and a complex perceptual loss that is coupled with a selective backpropagation procedure. Our algorithm is able not only to generate a set of plausible answers, but also to be competitive to the state of the art methods in multiple-choice tests.", "published": "2020-11-01 13:21:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00496v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Cheap IR Evaluation: Fewer Topics, No Relevance Judgements, and Crowdsourced Assessments", "abstract": "To evaluate Information Retrieval (IR) effectiveness, a possible approach is to use test collections, which are composed of a collection of documents, a set of description of information needs (called topics), and a set of relevant documents to each topic. Test collections are modelled in a competition scenario: for example, in the well known TREC initiative, participants run their own retrieval systems over a set of topics and they provide a ranked list of retrieved documents; some of the retrieved documents (usually the first ranked) constitute the so called pool, and their relevance is evaluated by human assessors; the document list is then used to compute effectiveness metrics and rank the participant systems. Private Web Search companies also run their in-house evaluation exercises; although the details are mostly unknown, and the aims are somehow different, the overall approach shares several issues with the test collection approach.\n  The aim of this work is to: (i) develop and improve some state-of-the-art work on the evaluation of IR effectiveness while saving resources, and (ii) propose a novel, more principled and engineered, overall approach to test collection based effectiveness evaluation.\n  [...]", "published": "2020-11-01 11:22:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00479v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A novel receiver design for energy packet-based dispatching", "abstract": "A steadily growing share of renewable energies with uctuating and decentralized generation as well as rising peak loads require novel solutions to ensure the reliability of electricity supply. More speci cally, grid stability is endangered by equally relevant line constraints and battery capacity limits. In this light, energy packet-based dispatching with power signal dual modulation has recently been introduced as an innovative solution. However, this approach assumes a central synchronicity provision unit for energy packet dispatching. In order to overcome this assumption, the present paper's main contribution is a design of an energy packet receiver which recovers the required synchronicity information directly from the received signal itself. Key implementation aspects are discussed in detail. By means of a DC grid example, simulation results show the performance and applicability of the proposed novel receiver for packet-based energy dispatching.", "published": "2020-11-01 13:28:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00497v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
