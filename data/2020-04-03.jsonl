{"title": "COVID-19: Strategies for Allocation of Test Kits", "abstract": "With the increasing spread of COVID-19, it is important to systematically test more and more people. The current strategy for test-kit allocation is mostly rule-based, focusing on individuals having (a) symptoms for COVID-19, (b) travel history or (c) contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such testing strategy may miss out on detecting asymptomatic individuals who got infected via community spread. Thus, it is important to allocate a separate budget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and detecting new cases early on.\n  In this report, we consider the problem of allocating test-kits and discuss some solution approaches. We believe that these approaches will be useful to contain community spread and detect new cases early on. Additionally, these approaches would help in collecting unbiased data which can then be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict COVID-19 infections.", "published": "2020-04-03 19:02:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01740v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Deep Transfer Learning for Texture Classification in Colorectal Cancer Histology", "abstract": "Microscopic examination of tissues or histopathology is one of the diagnostic procedures for detecting colorectal cancer. The pathologist involved in such an examination usually identifies tissue type based on texture analysis, especially focusing on tumour-stroma ratio. In this work, we automate the task of tissue classification within colorectal cancer histology samples using deep transfer learning. We use discriminative fine-tuning with one-cycle-policy and apply structure-preserving colour normalization to boost our results. We also provide visual explanations of the deep neural network's decision on texture classification. With achieving state-of-the-art test accuracy of 96.2% we also embark on using deployment friendly architecture called SqueezeNet for memory-limited hardware.", "published": "2020-04-03 15:05:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01614v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Detection of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Needle Biopsies with Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "Background: The detection of perineural invasion (PNI) by carcinoma in prostate biopsies has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. The assessment and quantification of PNI is; however, labor intensive. In the study we aimed to develop an algorithm based on deep neural networks to aid pathologists in this task.\n  Methods: We collected, digitized and pixel-wise annotated the PNI findings in each of the approximately 80,000 biopsy cores from the 7,406 men who underwent biopsy in the prospective and diagnostic STHLM3 trial between 2012 and 2014. In total, 485 biopsy cores showed PNI. We also digitized more than 10% (n=8,318) of the PNI negative biopsy cores. Digitized biopsies from a random selection of 80% of the men were used to build deep neural networks, and the remaining 20% were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.\n  Results: For the detection of PNI in prostate biopsy cores the network had an estimated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) based on 106 PNI positive cores and 1,652 PNI negative cores in the independent test set. For the pre-specified operating point this translates to sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.97. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 0.67 and 0.99, respectively. For localizing the regions of PNI within a slide we estimated an average intersection over union of 0.50 (CI: 0.46-0.55).\n  Conclusion: We have developed an algorithm based on deep neural networks for detecting PNI in prostate biopsies with apparently acceptable diagnostic properties. These algorithms have the potential to aid pathologists in the day-to-day work by drastically reducing the number of biopsy cores that need to be assessed for PNI and by highlighting regions of diagnostic interest.", "published": "2020-04-03 14:27:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01589v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
