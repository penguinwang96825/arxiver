{"title": "Big Data and Cross-Document Coreference Resolution: Current State and\n  Future Opportunities", "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting\nstructured information from unstructured/semi-structured machine-readable\ndocuments. Among various IE tasks, extracting actionable intelligence from\never-increasing amount of data depends critically upon Cross-Document\nCoreference Resolution (CDCR) - the task of identifying entity mentions across\nmultiple documents that refer to the same underlying entity. Recently, document\ndatasets of the order of peta-/tera-bytes has raised many challenges for\nperforming effective CDCR such as scaling to large numbers of mentions and\nlimited representational power. The problem of analysing such datasets is\ncalled \"big data\". The aim of this paper is to provide readers with an\nunderstanding of the central concepts, subtasks, and the current\nstate-of-the-art in CDCR process. We provide assessment of existing\ntools/techniques for CDCR subtasks and highlight big data challenges in each of\nthem to help readers identify important and outstanding issues for further\ninvestigation. Finally, we provide concluding remarks and discuss possible\ndirections for future work.", "published": "2013-11-14 06:10:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3987v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DC", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
