{"title": "A Comparison between Financial and Gambling Markets", "abstract": "Financial and gambling markets are ostensibly similar and hence strategies\nfrom one could potentially be applied to the other. Financial markets have been\nextensively studied, resulting in numerous theorems and models, while gambling\nmarkets have received comparatively less attention and remain relatively\nundocumented. This study conducts a comprehensive comparison of both markets,\nfocusing on trading rather than regulation. Five key aspects are examined:\nplatform, product, procedure, participant and strategy. The findings reveal\nnumerous similarities between these two markets. Financial exchanges resemble\nonline betting platforms, such as Betfair, and some financial products,\nincluding stocks and options, share speculative traits with sports betting. We\nexamine whether well-established models and strategies from financial markets\ncould be applied to the gambling industry, which lacks comparable frameworks.\nFor example, statistical arbitrage from financial markets has been effectively\napplied to gambling markets, particularly in peer-to-peer betting exchanges,\nwhere bettors exploit odds discrepancies for risk-free profits using\nquantitative models. Therefore, exploring the strategies and approaches used in\nboth markets could lead to new opportunities for innovation and optimization in\ntrading and betting activities.", "published": "2024-09-20 14:09:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13528v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
