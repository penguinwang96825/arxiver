{"title": "Differentially Private Language Models Benefit from Public Pre-training", "abstract": "Language modeling is a keystone task in natural language processing. When training a language model on sensitive information, differential privacy (DP) allows us to quantify the degree to which our private data is protected. However, training algorithms which enforce differential privacy often lead to degradation in model quality. We study the feasibility of learning a language model which is simultaneously high-quality and privacy preserving by tuning a public base model on a private corpus. We find that DP fine-tuning boosts the performance of language models in the private domain, making the training of such models possible.", "published": "2020-09-13 00:50:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05886v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.CR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Monte Carlo Tree Search Based Tactical Maneuvering", "abstract": "In this paper we explore the application of simultaneous move Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based online framework for tactical maneuvering between two unmanned aircrafts. Compared to other techniques, MCTS enables efficient search over long horizons and uses self-play to select best maneuver in the current state while accounting for the opponent aircraft tactics. We explore different algorithmic choices in MCTS and demonstrate the framework numerically in a simulated 2D tactical maneuvering application.", "published": "2020-09-13 02:03:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08807v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.MA", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Tax Knowledge Graph for a Smarter and More Personalized TurboTax", "abstract": "Most knowledge graph use cases are data-centric, focusing on representing data entities and their semantic relationships. There are no published success stories to represent large-scale complicated business logic with knowledge graph technologies. In this paper, we will share our innovative and practical approach to representing complicated U.S. and Canadian income tax compliance logic (calculations and rules) via a large-scale knowledge graph. We will cover how the Tax Knowledge Graph is constructed and automated, how it is used to calculate tax refunds, reasoned to find missing info, and navigated to explain the calculated results. The Tax Knowledge Graph has helped transform Intuit's flagship TurboTax product into a smart and personalized experience, accelerating and automating the tax preparation process while instilling confidence for millions of customers.", "published": "2020-09-13 22:41:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06103v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Random boosting and random^2 forests -- A random tree depth injection approach", "abstract": "The induction of additional randomness in parallel and sequential ensemble methods has proven to be worthwhile in many aspects. In this manuscript, we propose and examine a novel random tree depth injection approach suitable for sequential and parallel tree-based approaches including Boosting and Random Forests. The resulting methods are called \\emph{Random Boost} and \\emph{Random$^2$ Forest}. Both approaches serve as valuable extensions to the existing literature on the gradient boosting framework and random forests. A Monte Carlo simulation, in which tree-shaped data sets with different numbers of final partitions are built, suggests that there are several scenarios where \\emph{Random Boost} and \\emph{Random$^2$ Forest} can improve the prediction performance of conventional hierarchical boosting and random forest approaches. The new algorithms appear to be especially successful in cases where there are merely a few high-order interactions in the generated data. In addition, our simulations suggest that our random tree depth injection approach can improve computation time by up to 40%, while at the same time the performance losses in terms of prediction accuracy turn out to be minor or even negligible in most cases.", "published": "2020-09-13 20:14:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06078v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "stat.CO", "stat.ME"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
