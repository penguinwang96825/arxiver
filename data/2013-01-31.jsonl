{"title": "PyPLN: a Distributed Platform for Natural Language Processing", "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed platform for Natural Language Processing\ncalled PyPLN. PyPLN leverages a vast array of NLP and text processing open\nsource tools, managing the distribution of the workload on a variety of\nconfigurations: from a single server to a cluster of linux servers. PyPLN is\ndeveloped using Python 2.7.3 but makes it very easy to incorporate other\nsoftwares for specific tasks as long as a linux version is available. PyPLN\nfacilitates analyses both at document and corpus level, simplifying management\nand publication of corpora and analytical results through an easy to use web\ninterface. In the current (beta) release, it supports English and Portuguese\nlanguages with support to other languages planned for future releases. To\nsupport the Portuguese language PyPLN uses the PALAVRAS parser\\citep{Bick2000}.\nCurrently PyPLN offers the following features: Text extraction with encoding\nnormalization (to UTF-8), part-of-speech tagging, token frequency, semantic\nannotation, n-gram extraction, word and sentence repertoire, and full-text\nsearch across corpora. The platform is licensed as GPL-v3.", "published": "2013-01-31 20:21:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7738v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
