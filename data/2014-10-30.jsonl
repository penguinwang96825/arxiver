{"title": "Training for Fast Sequential Prediction Using Dynamic Feature Selection", "abstract": "We present paired learning and inference algorithms for significantly\nreducing computation and increasing speed of the vector dot products in the\nclassifiers that are at the heart of many NLP components. This is accomplished\nby partitioning the features into a sequence of templates which are ordered\nsuch that high confidence can often be reached using only a small fraction of\nall features. Parameter estimation is arranged to maximize accuracy and early\nconfidence in this sequence. We present experiments in left-to-right\npart-of-speech tagging on WSJ, demonstrating that we can preserve accuracy\nabove 97% with over a five-fold reduction in run-time.", "published": "2014-10-30 19:02:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8498v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Semi-Automatic Construction of a Domain Ontology for Wind Energy Using\n  Wikipedia Articles", "abstract": "Domain ontologies are important information sources for knowledge-based\nsystems. Yet, building domain ontologies from scratch is known to be a very\nlabor-intensive process. In this study, we present our semi-automatic approach\nto building an ontology for the domain of wind energy which is an important\ntype of renewable energy with a growing share in electricity generation all\nover the world. Related Wikipedia articles are first processed in an automated\nmanner to determine the basic concepts of the domain together with their\nproperties and next the concepts, properties, and relationships are organized\nto arrive at the ultimate ontology. We also provide pointers to other\nengineering ontologies which could be utilized together with the proposed wind\nenergy ontology in addition to its prospective application areas. The current\nstudy is significant as, to the best of our knowledge, it proposes the first\nconsiderably wide-coverage ontology for the wind energy domain and the ontology\nis built through a semi-automatic process which makes use of the related Web\nresources, thereby reducing the overall cost of the ontology building process.", "published": "2014-10-30 22:38:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8581v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "What a Nasty day: Exploring Mood-Weather Relationship from Twitter", "abstract": "While it has long been believed in psychology that weather somehow influences\nhuman's mood, the debates have been going on for decades about how they are\ncorrelated. In this paper, we try to study this long-lasting topic by\nharnessing a new source of data compared from traditional psychological\nresearches: Twitter. We analyze 2 years' twitter data collected by twitter API\nwhich amounts to $10\\%$ of all postings and try to reveal the correlations\nbetween multiple dimensional structure of human mood with meteorological\neffects. Some of our findings confirm existing hypotheses, while others\ncontradict them. We are hopeful that our approach, along with the new data\nsource, can shed on the long-going debates on weather-mood correlation.", "published": "2014-10-30 18:51:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8749v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Addressing the Rare Word Problem in Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach to machine translation\nthat has shown promising results that are comparable to traditional approaches.\nA significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to\ncorrectly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively\nsmall vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible\nout-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an\neffective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data\nthat is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT\nsystem to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its\ncorresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized\nin a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary.\nOur experiments on the WMT14 English to French translation task show that this\nmethod provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an\nequivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points,\nour NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT14\ncontest task.", "published": "2014-10-30 00:20:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8206v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "A random forest system combination approach for error detection in\n  digital dictionaries", "abstract": "When digitizing a print bilingual dictionary, whether via optical character\nrecognition or manual entry, it is inevitable that errors are introduced into\nthe electronic version that is created. We investigate automating the process\nof detecting errors in an XML representation of a digitized print dictionary\nusing a hybrid approach that combines rule-based, feature-based, and language\nmodel-based methods. We investigate combining methods and show that using\nrandom forests is a promising approach. We find that in isolation, unsupervised\nmethods rival the performance of supervised methods. Random forests typically\nrequire training data so we investigate how we can apply random forests to\ncombine individual base methods that are themselves unsupervised without\nrequiring large amounts of training data. Experiments reveal empirically that a\nrelatively small amount of data is sufficient and can potentially be further\nreduced through specific selection criteria.", "published": "2014-10-30 20:52:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8553v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
