{"title": "Partially perfect hash functions for intersecting families", "abstract": "Consider a large network with unknown number of nodes. Some of these nodes coordinate to perform tasks. The number of such coordination groups is also unknown. The only information about the network available is that any two coordinating groups share at least $t$ nodes. To complete a particular task in a day, at least $p$ nodes of the corresponding coordinating group must get different time slots out of the $r$ available slots per day. Is there a way of estimating the number of days required such that every coordinating group gets at least one day where it can complete the task? As it turns out, this problem is a special case of \\textit{partially} perfect hash functions for intersecting families.", "published": "2018-08-07 09:20:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02273v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "A generalized scheme for BSDEs based on derivative approximation and its error estimates", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a generalized numerical scheme for backward stochastic differential equations(BSDEs). The scheme is based on approximation of derivatives via Lagrange interpolation. By changing the distribution of sample points used for interpolation, one can get various numerical schemes with different stability and convergence order. We present a condition for the distribution of sample points to guarantee the convergence of the scheme.", "published": "2018-08-07 01:23:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02478v1", "categories": ["math.NA", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.NA"}
{"title": "Optimal Subpattern Assignment Metric for Multiple Tracks (OSPAMT Metric)", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new metric which measures the distance between two finite sets of tracks (a track is a path of either a real or estimated target). This metric is based on the same principle as the Optimal Subpattern Assignment (OSPA) metric devised by Schuhmacher et al. Importantly however, the new metric measures the distance between two finite sets of tracks whereas the OSPA metric measures the distance between two finite sets of target states. By also considering the properties of false tracks, missed tracks and many tracks assigned to one track situations caused by missed detections and false alarms, the minimization of all distances between tracks across two finite sets of tracks employed by the new OSPAMT metric enables performance evaluation of multi-target tracking (MTT) algorithms in a more comprehensive and accurate manner than existing metrics such as the OSPA metric and the enhanced OSPAT metric introduced by Ristic et al which measures the distance between two finite sets of labeled target states.", "published": "2018-08-07 07:51:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02242v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Emitter Identification Using CNN IQ Imbalance Estimators", "abstract": "Specific Emitter Identification is the association of a received signal to a unique emitter, and is made possible by the naturally occurring and unintentional characteristics an emitter imparts onto each transmission, known as its radio frequency fingerprint. This work presents an approach for identifying emitters using Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the IQ imbalance parameters of each emitter, using only raw IQ data as input. Because an emitter's IQ imbalance parameters will not change as it changes modulation schemes, the proposed approach has the ability to track emitters, even as they change modulation scheme. The performance of the developed approach is evaluated using simulated quadrature amplitude modulation and phase-shift keying signals, and the impact of signal-to-noise ratio, imbalance value, and modulation scheme are considered. Further, the developed approach is shown to outperform a comparable feature-based approach, while making fewer assumptions and using less data.", "published": "2018-08-07 13:51:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02369v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
