{"title": "Text Classification Using Association Rules, Dependency Pruning and\n  Hyperonymization", "abstract": "We present new methods for pruning and enhancing item- sets for text\nclassification via association rule mining. Pruning methods are based on\ndependency syntax and enhancing methods are based on replacing words by their\nhyperonyms of various orders. We discuss the impact of these methods, compared\nto pruning based on tfidf rank of words.", "published": "2014-07-28 09:00:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7357v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
