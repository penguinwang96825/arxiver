{"title": "Supporting Language Learners with the Meanings Of Closed Class Items", "abstract": "The process of language learning involves the mastery of countless tasks:\nmaking the constituent sounds of the language being learned, learning the\ngrammatical patterns, and acquiring the requisite vocabulary for reception and\nproduction. While a plethora of computational tools exist to facilitate the\nfirst and second of these tasks, a number of challenges arise with respect to\nenabling the third. This paper describes a tool that has been designed to\nsupport language learners with the challenge of understanding the use of\nclosed-class lexical items. The process of learning the Arabic for office is\n(mktb) is relatively simple and should be possible by means of simple\nrepetition of the word. However, it is much more difficult to learn and\ncorrectly use the Arabic equivalent of the word on. The current paper describes\na mechanism for the delivery of diagnostic information regarding specific\nlexical examples, with the aim of clearly demonstrating why a particular\ntranslation of a given closed-class item may be appropriate in certain\nsituations but not others, thereby helping learners to understand and use the\nterm correctly.", "published": "2015-04-08 18:12:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02059v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Mining and discovering biographical information in Difangzhi with a\n  language-model-based approach", "abstract": "We present results of expanding the contents of the China Biographical\nDatabase by text mining historical local gazetteers, difangzhi. The goal of the\ndatabase is to see how people are connected together, through kinship, social\nconnections, and the places and offices in which they served. The gazetteers\nare the single most important collection of names and offices covering the Song\nthrough Qing periods. Although we begin with local officials we shall\neventually include lists of local examination candidates, people from the\nlocality who served in government, and notable local figures with biographies.\nThe more data we collect the more connections emerge. The value of doing\nsystematic text mining work is that we can identify relevant connections that\nare either directly informative or can become useful without deep historical\nresearch. Academia Sinica is developing a name database for officials in the\ncentral governments of the Ming and Qing dynasties.", "published": "2015-04-08 22:38:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02148v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.DL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Exploring Lexical, Syntactic, and Semantic Features for Chinese Textual\n  Entailment in NTCIR RITE Evaluation Tasks", "abstract": "We computed linguistic information at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic\nlevels for Recognizing Inference in Text (RITE) tasks for both traditional and\nsimplified Chinese in NTCIR-9 and NTCIR-10. Techniques for syntactic parsing,\nnamed-entity recognition, and near synonym recognition were employed, and\nfeatures like counts of common words, statement lengths, negation words, and\nantonyms were considered to judge the entailment relationships of two\nstatements, while we explored both heuristics-based functions and\nmachine-learning approaches. The reported systems showed robustness by\nsimultaneously achieving second positions in the binary-classification subtasks\nfor both simplified and traditional Chinese in NTCIR-10 RITE-2. We conducted\nmore experiments with the test data of NTCIR-9 RITE, with good results. We also\nextended our work to search for better configurations of our classifiers and\ninvestigated contributions of individual features. This extended work showed\ninteresting results and should encourage further discussion.", "published": "2015-04-08 22:47:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02150v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.DL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
