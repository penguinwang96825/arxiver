Similarity-based\nobservations are matched to the actual year when a figurative meaning was\ndocumented in a reference dictionary and through manual inspection of corpus\noccurrences.", "published": "2016-11-10 12:22:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03279v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism", "abstract": "Encoder-decoder models have been widely used to solve sequence to sequence\nprediction tasks. However current approaches suffer from two shortcomings.\nFirst, the encoders compute a representation of each word taking into account\nonly the history of the words it has read so far, yielding suboptimal\nrepresentations. Second, current decoders utilize large vocabularies in order\nto minimize the problem of unknown words, resulting in slow decoding times. In\nthis paper we address both shortcomings. Towards this goal, we first introduce\na simple mechanism that first reads the input sequence before committing to a\nrepresentation of each word. Furthermore, we propose a simple copy mechanism\nthat is able to exploit very small vocabularies and handle out-of-vocabulary\nwords. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Gigaword dataset\nand DUC competition outperforming the state-of-the-art.", "published": "2016-11-10 16:23:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03382v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Syntactic Enhancement to VSIMM for Roadmap Based Anomalous Trajectory\n  Detection: A Natural Language Processing Approach", "abstract": "The aim of syntactic tracking is to classify spatio-temporal patterns of a\ntarget's motion using natural language processing models. In this paper, we\ngeneralize earlier work by considering a constrained stochastic context free\ngrammar (CSCFG) for modeling patterns confined to a roadmap. The constrained\ngrammar facilitates modeling specific directions and road names in a roadmap.\nWe present a novel particle filtering algorithm that exploits the CSCFG model\nfor estimating the target's patterns. This meta-level algorithm operates in\nconjunction with a base-level tracking algorithm. Extensive numerical results\nusing simulated ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar measurements show\nsubstantial improvement in target tracking accuracy.", "published": "2016-11-10 20:13:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03466v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Landmark-based consonant voicing detection on multilingual corpora", "abstract": "This paper tests the hypothesis that distinctive feature classifiers anchored\nat phonetic landmarks can be transferred cross-lingually without loss of\naccuracy. Three consonant voicing classifiers were developed: (1) manually\nselected acoustic features anchored at a phonetic landmark, (2) MFCCs (either\naveraged across the segment or anchored at the landmark), and(3) acoustic\nfeatures computed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). All detectors are\ntrained on English data (TIMIT),and tested on English, Turkish, and Spanish\n(performance measured using F1 and accuracy). Experiments demonstrate that\nmanual features outperform all MFCC classifiers, while CNNfeatures outperform\nboth. MFCC-based classifiers suffer an F1reduction of 16% absolute when\ngeneralized from English to other languages. Manual features suffer only a 5%\nF1 reduction,and CNN features actually perform better in Turkish and Span-ish\nthan in the training language, demonstrating that features capable of\nrepresenting long-term spectral dynamics (CNN and landmark-based features) are\nable to generalize cross-lingually with little or no loss of accuracy", "published": "2016-11-10 22:11:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03533v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning to Play Guess Who? and Inventing a Grounded Language as a\n  Consequence", "abstract": "Acquiring your first language is an incredible feat and not easily\nduplicated. Learning to communicate using nothing but a few pictureless books,\na corpus, would likely be impossible even for humans. Nevertheless, this is the\ndominating approach in most natural language processing today. As an\nalternative, we propose the use of situated interactions between agents as a\ndriving force for communication, and the framework of Deep Recurrent Q-Networks\nfor evolving a shared language grounded in the provided environment. We task\nthe agents with interactive image search in the form of the game Guess Who?.\nThe images from the game provide a non trivial environment for the agents to\ndiscuss and a natural grounding for the concepts they decide to encode in their\ncommunication. Our experiments show that the agents learn not only to encode\nphysical concepts in their words, i.e. grounding, but also that the agents\nlearn to hold a multi-step dialogue remembering the state of the dialogue from\nstep to step.", "published": "2016-11-10 08:44:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03218v4", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
