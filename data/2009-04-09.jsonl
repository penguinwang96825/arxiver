{"title": "Regime Switching Volatility Calibration by the Baum-Welch Method", "abstract": "Regime switching volatility models provide a tractable method of modelling stochastic volatility. Currently the most popular method of regime switching calibration is the Hamilton filter. We propose using the Baum-Welch algorithm, an established technique from Engineering, to calibrate regime switching models instead. We demonstrate the Baum-Welch algorithm and discuss the significant advantages that it provides compared to the Hamilton filter. We provide computational results of calibrating the Baum-Welch filter to S&P 500 data and validate its performance in and out of sample.", "published": "2009-04-09 10:56:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1500v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
