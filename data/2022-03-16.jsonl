{"title": "Double sweep LU decomposition for American options under negative rates", "abstract": "The classic Brennan-Schwartz algorithm to solve the linear complementary problem, which arises from the finite difference discretization of the partial differential equation related to American option pricing does not lead to the exact solution under negative interest rates. This is due to the two exercise boundaries which may appear under negative interest rate, while the algorithm was proven to lead to the exact solution in the case of a single exercise boundary only. This paper explains that two sweeps of the Brennan-Schwartz algorithm in two directions is enough to recover the exact solution.", "published": "2022-03-16 17:55:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08794v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
