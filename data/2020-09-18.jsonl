{"title": "Residual Spatial Attention Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation", "abstract": "Reliable segmentation of retinal vessels can be employed as a way of monitoring and diagnosing certain diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, as they affect the retinal vascular structure. In this work, we propose the Residual Spatial Attention Network (RSAN) for retinal vessel segmentation. RSAN employs a modified residual block structure that integrates DropBlock, which can not only be utilized to construct deep networks to extract more complex vascular features, but can also effectively alleviate the overfitting. Moreover, in order to further improve the representation capability of the network, based on this modified residual block, we introduce the spatial attention (SA) and propose the Residual Spatial Attention Block (RSAB) to build RSAN. We adopt the public DRIVE and CHASE DB1 color fundus image datasets to evaluate the proposed RSAN. Experiments show that the modified residual structure and the spatial attention are effective in this work, and our proposed RSAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "published": "2020-09-18 13:17:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08829v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Blocking total dominating sets via edge contractions", "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of deciding whether the total domination number of a given graph $G$ can be reduced using exactly one edge contraction (called 1-Edge Contraction($\u03b3_t$)). We focus on several graph classes and determine the computational complexity of this problem. By putting together these results, we manage to obtain a complete dichotomy for $H$-free graphs.", "published": "2020-09-18 12:40:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08806v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "A Knowledge Graph based Approach for Mobile Application Recommendation", "abstract": "With the rapid prevalence of mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobile applications (apps), app recommendation becomes an emergent task that would benefit both app users and stockholders. How to effectively organize and make full use of rich side information of users and apps is a key challenge to address the sparsity issue for traditional approaches. To meet this challenge, we proposed a novel end-to-end Knowledge Graph Convolutional Embedding Propagation Model (KGEP) for app recommendation. Specifically, we first designed a knowledge graph construction method to model the user and app side information, then adopted KG embedding techniques to capture the factual triplet-focused semantics of the side information related to the first-order structure of the KG, and finally proposed a relation-weighted convolutional embedding propagation model to capture the recommendation-focused semantics related to high-order structure of the KG. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches.", "published": "2020-09-18 04:17:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08621v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Decentralized Game-Theoretic Control for Dynamic Task Allocation Problems for Multi-Agent Systems", "abstract": "We propose a decentralized game-theoretic framework for dynamic task allocation problems for multi-agent systems. In our problem formulation, the agents' utilities depend on both the rewards and the costs associated with the successful completion of the tasks assigned to them. The rewards reflect how likely is for the agents to accomplish their assigned tasks whereas the costs reflect the effort needed to complete these tasks (this effort is determined by the solution of corresponding optimal control problems). The task allocation problem considered herein corresponds to a dynamic game whose solution depends on the states of the agents in contrast with classic static (or single-act) game formulations. We propose a greedy solution approach in which the agents negotiate with each other to find a mutually agreeable (or individually rational) task assignment profile based on evaluations of the task utilities that reflect their current states. We illustrate the main ideas of this work by means of extensive numerical simulations.", "published": "2020-09-18 05:03:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08628v2", "categories": ["cs.MA", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Explicit solution simulation method for the 3/2 model", "abstract": "An explicit weak solution for the 3/2 stochastic volatility model is obtained and used to develop a simulation algorithm for option pricing purposes. The 3/2 model is a non-affine stochastic volatility model whose variance process is the inverse of a CIR process. This property is exploited here to obtain an explicit weak solution, similarly to Kouritzin (2018). A simulation algorithm based on this solution is proposed and tested via numerical examples. The performance of the resulting pricing algorithm is comparable to that of other popular simulation algorithms.", "published": "2020-09-18 20:43:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09058v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
