{"title": "Robust and Fast Bass local volatility", "abstract": "The Bass Local Volatility Model (Bass-LV), as studied in\n\\citep{henry2021bass}, stands out for its ability to eliminate the need for\ninterpolation between maturities. This offers a significant advantage over\ntraditional LV models. However, its performance highly depends on accurate\nconstruction of state price densities and the corresponding marginal\ndistributions and efficient numerical convolutions which are necessary when\nsolving the associated fixed point problems. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach combining local quadratic estimation and lognormal mixture tails for\nthe construction of state price densities. We investigate computational\nefficiency of trapezoidal rule based schemes for numerical convolutions and\nshow that they outperform commonly used Gauss-Hermite quadrature. We\ndemonstrate the performance of the proposed method, both in standard option\npricing models, as well as through a detailed market case study.", "published": "2024-11-06 23:49:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04321v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Finding the nonnegative minimal solutions of Cauchy PDEs in a volatility-stabilized market", "abstract": "The strong relative arbitrage problem in Stochastic Portfolio Theory seeks to\ngenerate an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark\nportfolio at the end of a given time horizon. The highest relative return in\nrelative arbitrage opportunities is characterized by the smallest nonnegative\ncontinuous solution of a Cauchy problem for a partial differential equation\n(PDE). However, solving this type of PDE poses analytical and numerical\nchallenges, due to the high dimensionality and its non-unique solutions. In\nthis paper, we discuss numerical methods to address the relative arbitrage\nproblem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market, using\ntime-changed Bessel bridges.

{"title": "Market efficiency, informational asymmetry and pseudo-collusion of adaptively learning agents", "abstract": "We examine the dynamics of informational efficiency in a market with\nasymmetrically informed, boundedly rational traders who adaptively learn\noptimal strategies using simple multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms. The\nstrategies available to the traders have two dimensions: on the one hand, the\ntraders must endogenously choose whether to acquire a costly information\nsignal, on the other, they must determine how aggressively they trade by\nchoosing the share of their wealth to be invested in the risky asset. Our study\ncontributes to two strands of literature: the literature comparing the effects\nof competitive and strategic behavior on asset price efficiency under costly\ninformation as well as the actively growing literature on algorithmic tacit\ncollusion and pseudo-collusion in financial markets. We find that for certain\nmarket environments (with low information costs) our model reproduces the\nresults of Kyle [1989] in that the ability of traders to trade strategically\nleads to worse price efficiency compared to the purely competitive case. For\nother environments (with high information costs), on the other hand, our\nresults show that a market with strategically acting traders can be more\nefficient than a purely competitive one. Furthermore, we obtain novel results\non the ability of independently learning traders to coordinate on a\npseudo-collusive behavior, leading to non-competitive pricing. Contrary to some\nrecent contributions (see e.g. [Cartea et al. 2022]), we find that the\npseudo-collusive behavior in our model is robust to a large number of agents,\ndemonstrating that even in the setting of financial markets with a large number\nof independently learning traders non-competitive pricing and pseudo-collusive\nbehavior can frequently arise.", "published": "2024-11-06 10:06:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05032v1", "categories": ["econ.TH", "cs.GT", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "econ.TH"}
{"title": "Volatility Parametrizations with Random Coefficients: Analytic Flexibility for Implied Volatility Surfaces", "abstract": "It is a market practice to express market-implied volatilities in some\nparametric form. The most popular parametrizations are based on or inspired by\nan underlying stochastic model, like the Heston model (SVI method) or the SABR\nmodel (SABR parametrization). Their popularity is often driven by a closed-form\nrepresentation enabling efficient calibration. However, these representations\nindirectly impose a model-specific volatility structure on observable market\nquotes. When the market's volatility does not follow the parametric model\nregime, the calibration procedure will fail or lead to extreme parameters,\nindicating inconsistency. This article addresses this critical limitation - we\npropose an arbitrage-free framework for letting the parameters from the\nparametric implied volatility formula be random. The method enhances the\nexisting parametrizations and enables a significant widening of the spectrum of\npermissible shapes of implied volatilities while preserving analyticity and,\ntherefore, computation efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nnovel method on real data from short-term index and equity options, where the\nstandard parametrizations fail to capture market dynamics. Our results show\nthat the proposed method is particularly powerful in modeling the implied\nvolatility curves of short expiry options preceding an earnings announcement,\nwhen the risk-neutral probability density function exhibits a bimodal form.", "published": "2024-11-06 16:40:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04041v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
