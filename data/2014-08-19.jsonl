{"title": "Towards crowdsourcing and cooperation in linguistic resources", "abstract": "Linguistic resources can be populated with data through the use of such\napproaches as crowdsourcing and gamification when motivated people are\ninvolved. However, current crowdsourcing genre taxonomies lack the concept of\ncooperation, which is the principal element of modern video games and may\npotentially drive the annotators' interest. This survey on crowdsourcing\ntaxonomies and cooperation in linguistic resources provides recommendations on\nusing cooperation in existent genres of crowdsourcing and an evidence of the\nefficiency of cooperation using a popular Russian linguistic resource created\nthrough crowdsourcing as an example.", "published": "2014-08-19 08:32:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4245v2", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "K.4.3"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
