{"title": "TaBooN -- Boolean Network Synthesis Based on Tabu Search", "abstract": "Recent developments in Omics-technologies revolutionized the investigation of biology by producing molecular data in multiple dimensions and scale. This breakthrough in biology raises the crucial issue of their interpretation based on modelling. In this undertaking, network provides a suitable framework for modelling the interactions between molecules. Basically a Biological network is composed of nodes referring to the components such as genes or proteins, and the edges/arcs formalizing interactions between them. The evolution of the interactions is then modelled by the definition of a dynamical system. Among the different categories of network, the Boolean network offers a reliable qualitative framework for the modelling. Automatically synthesizing a Boolean network from experimental data therefore remains a necessary but challenging issue. In this study, we present taboon, an original work-flow for synthesizing Boolean Networks from biological data. The methodology uses the data in the form of Boolean profiles for inferring all the potential local formula inference. They combine to form the model space from which the most truthful model with regards to biological knowledge and experiments must be found. In the taboon work-flow the selection of the fittest model is achieved by a Tabu-search algorithm. taboon is an automated method for Boolean Network inference from experimental data that can also assist to evaluate and optimize the dynamic behaviour of the biological networks providing a reliable platform for further modelling and predictions.", "published": "2020-09-08 08:56:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03587v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CE", "q-bio.MN"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "COVIDNet-CT: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT Images", "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world. In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.", "published": "2020-09-08 15:49:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05383v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Metis: Multi-Agent Based Crisis Simulation System", "abstract": "With the advent of the computational technologies (Graphics Processing Units - GPUs) and Machine Learning, the research domain of crowd simulation for crisis management has flourished. Along with the new techniques and methodologies that have been proposed all those years, aiming to increase the realism of crowd simulation, several crisis simulation systems/tools have been developed, but most of them focus on special cases without providing users the ability to adapt them based on their needs. Towards these directions, in this paper, we introduce a novel multi-agent-based crisis simulation system for indoor cases. The main advantage of the system is its ease of use feature, focusing on non-expert users (users with little to no programming skills) that can exploit its capabilities a, adapt the entire environment based on their needs (Case studies) and set up building evacuation planning experiments with some of the most popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Simply put, the system's features focus on dynamic environment design and crisis management, interconnection with popular Reinforcement Learning libraries, agents with different characteristics (behaviors), fire propagation parameterization, realistic physics based on popular game engine, GPU-accelerated agents training and simulation end conditions. A case study exploiting a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, for training of the agents, presents the dynamics and the capabilities of the proposed systems and the paper is concluded with the highlights of the system and some future directions.", "published": "2020-09-08 18:22:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03934v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Predictions of Subjective Ratings and Spoofing Assessments of Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 Submissions", "abstract": "The Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 is the third edition under its flagship that promotes intra-lingual semiparallel and cross-lingual voice conversion (VC). While the primary evaluation of the challenge submissions was done through crowd-sourced listening tests, we also performed an objective assessment of the submitted systems. The aim of the objective assessment is to provide complementary performance analysis that may be more beneficial than the time-consuming listening tests. In this study, we examined five types of objective assessments using automatic speaker verification (ASV), neural speaker embeddings, spoofing countermeasures, predicted mean opinion scores (MOS), and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Each of these objective measures assesses the VC output along different aspects. We observed that the correlations of these objective assessments with the subjective results were high for ASV, neural speaker embedding, and ASR, which makes them more influential for predicting subjective test results. In addition, we performed spoofing assessments on the submitted systems and identified some of the VC methods showing a potentially high security risk.", "published": "2020-09-08 07:17:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03554v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
