{"title": "The fractional volatility model: No-arbitrage, leverage and completeness", "abstract": "Based on a criterion of mathematical simplicity and consistency with empirical market data, a stochastic volatility model has been obtained with the volatility process driven by fractional noise. Depending on whether the stochasticity generators of log-price and volatility are independent or are the same, two versions of the model are obtained with different leverage behavior. Here, the no-arbitrage and completeness properties of the models are studied.", "published": "2012-05-13 14:21:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2866v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
