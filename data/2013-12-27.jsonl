{"title": "Quality Estimation of English-Hindi Outputs using Naive Bayes Classifier", "abstract": "In this paper we present an approach for estimating the quality of machine\ntranslation system. There are various methods for estimating the quality of\noutput sentences, but in this paper we focus on Na\\\"ive Bayes classifier to\nbuild model using features which are extracted from the input sentences. These\nfeatures are used for finding the likelihood of each of the sentences of the\ntraining data which are then further used for determining the scores of the\ntest data. On the basis of these scores we determine the class labels of the\ntest data.", "published": "2013-12-27 09:39:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7223v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
