{"title": "Leveraging Large Self-Supervised Time-Series Models for Transferable Diagnosis in Cross-Aircraft Type Bleed Air System", "abstract": "Bleed Air System (BAS) is critical for maintaining flight safety and\noperational efficiency, supporting functions such as cabin pressurization, air\nconditioning, and engine anti-icing. However, BAS malfunctions, including\noverpressure, low pressure, and overheating, pose significant risks such as\ncabin depressurization, equipment failure, or engine damage. Current diagnostic\napproaches face notable limitations when applied across different aircraft\ntypes, particularly for newer models that lack sufficient operational data. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents a self-supervised learning-based\nfoundation model that enables the transfer of diagnostic knowledge from mature\naircraft (e.g., A320, A330) to newer ones (e.g., C919). Leveraging\nself-supervised pretraining, the model learns universal feature representations\nfrom flight signals without requiring labeled data, making it effective in\ndata-scarce scenarios. This model enhances both anomaly detection and baseline\nsignal prediction, thereby improving system reliability. The paper introduces a\ncross-model dataset, a self-supervised learning framework for BAS diagnostics,\nand a novel Joint Baseline and Anomaly Detection Loss Function tailored to\nreal-world flight data. These innovations facilitate efficient transfer of\ndiagnostic knowledge across aircraft types, ensuring robust support for early\noperational stages of new models. Additionally, the paper explores the\nrelationship between model capacity and transferability, providing a foundation\nfor future research on large-scale flight signal models.", "published": "2025-04-12 06:06:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09090v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Towards On-Device Learning and Reconfigurable Hardware Implementation for Encoded Single-Photon Signal Processing", "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) enhance the accuracy and efficiency of\nreconstructing key parameters from time-resolved photon arrival signals\nrecorded by single-photon detectors. However, the performance of conventional\nbackpropagation-based DNNs is highly dependent on various parameters of the\noptical setup and biological samples under examination, necessitating frequent\nnetwork retraining, either through transfer learning or from scratch. Newly\ncollected data must also be stored and transferred to a high-performance GPU\nserver for retraining, introducing latency and storage overhead. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an online training algorithm based on a One-Sided\nJacobi rotation-based Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSOS-ELM). We\nfully exploit parallelism in executing OSOS-ELM on a heterogeneous FPGA with\nintegrated ARM cores. Extensive evaluations of OSOS-ELM and OSELM demonstrate\nthat both achieve comparable accuracy across different network dimensions\n(i.e., input, hidden, and output layers), while OSOS-ELM proves to be more\nhardware-efficient. By leveraging the parallelism of OSOS-ELM, we implement a\nholistic computing prototype on a Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, which integrates a\nmulti-core CPU and programmable logic fabric. We validate our approach through\nthree case studies involving single-photon signal analysis: sensing through fog\nusing commercial single-photon LiDAR, fluorescence lifetime estimation in FLIM,\nand blood flow index reconstruction in DCS, all utilizing one-dimensional data\nencoded from photonic signals. From a hardware perspective, we optimize the\nOSOS-ELM workload by employing multi-tasked processing on ARM CPU cores and\npipelined execution on the FPGA's logic fabric. We also implement our OSOS-ELM\non the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX GPU to comprehensively investigate its computing\nperformance on another type of heterogeneous computing platform.", "published": "2025-04-12 00:58:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09028v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "Inferring Outcome Means of Exponential Family Distributions Estimated by Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "While deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for prediction, inference\non DNN-estimated subject-specific means for categorical or exponential family\noutcomes remains underexplored. We address this by proposing a DNN estimator\nunder generalized nonparametric regression models (GNRMs) and developing a\nrigorous inference framework. Unlike existing approaches that assume\nindependence between prediction errors and inputs to establish the error bound,\na condition often violated in GNRMs, we allow for dependence and our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of drawing inference under\nGNRMs. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM)\nthat leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct\nreliable confidence intervals for DNN estimates. We show that, under GNRM\nsettings, ESM enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for\nheterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through simulations under\nnonparametric logistic, Poisson, and binomial regression models, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

{"title": "FairACE: Achieving Degree Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Contrastive and Adversarial Group-Balanced Training", "abstract": "Fairness has been a significant challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs)\nsince degree biases often result in un-equal prediction performance among nodes\nwith varying degrees. Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy,\nfrequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis\nissue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric\nContrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive\nlearning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures\none-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to\ncreate fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to\nbalance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model\ntraining, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize\nclassification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a\nnovel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can\nquantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different\ndegree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness\nmetrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art GNN models.", "published": "2025-04-12 13:32:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09210v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
