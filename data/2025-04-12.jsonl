{"title": "On the rate of convergence of estimating the Hurst parameter of rough stochastic volatility models", "abstract": "In [8], easily computable scale-invariant estimator\n$\\widehat{\\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ was constructed to estimate the Hurst parameter of\nthe drifted fractional Brownian motion $X$ from its antiderivative. This paper\nextends this convergence result by proving that $\\widehat{\\mathscr{R}}^s_n$\nalso consistently estimates the Hurst parameter when applied to the\nantiderivative of $g \\circ X$ for a general nonlinear function $g$. We also\nestablish an almost sure rate of convergence in this general setting. Our\nresult applies, in particular, to the estimation of the Hurst parameter of a\nwide class of rough stochastic volatility models from discrete observations of\nthe integrated variance, including the fractional stochastic volatility model.", "published": "2025-04-12 16:48:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09276v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "math.PR", "math.ST", "q-fin.MF", "stat.TH", "62P05, 60F15, 60G22, 91G70"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
