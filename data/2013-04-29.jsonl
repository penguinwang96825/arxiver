{"title": "Machine Translation Systems in India", "abstract": "Machine Translation is the translation of one natural language into another\nusing automated and computerized means. For a multilingual country like India,\nwith the huge amount of information exchanged between various regions and in\ndifferent languages in digitized format, it has become necessary to find an\nautomated process from one language to another. In this paper, we take a look\nat the various Machine Translation System in India which is specifically built\nfor the purpose of translation between the Indian languages. We discuss the\nvarious approaches taken for building the machine translation system and then\ndiscuss some of the Machine Translation Systems in India along with their\nfeatures.", "published": "2013-04-29 18:04:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7728v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
