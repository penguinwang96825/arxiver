{"title": "American Call Options Pricing With Modular Neural Networks", "abstract": "An accurate valuation of American call options is critical in most financial\ndecision making environments. However, traditional models like the Barone-Adesi\nWhaley (B-AW) and Binomial Option Pricing (BOP) methods fall short in handling\nthe complexities of early exercise and market dynamics present in American\noptions. This paper proposes a Modular Neural Network (MNN) model which aims to\ncapture the key aspects of American options pricing. By dividing the prediction\nprocess into specialized modules, the MNN effectively models the non-linear\ninteractions that drive American call options pricing. Experimental results\nindicate that the MNN model outperform both traditional models as well as a\nsimpler Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) across multiple stocks (AAPL, NVDA,\nQQQ), with significantly lower RMSE and nRMSE (by mean). These findings\nhighlight the potential of MNNs as a powerful tool to improve the accuracy of\npredicting option prices.", "published": "2024-09-29 13:50:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19706v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Stock Price Prediction and Traditional Models: An Approach to Achieve Short-, Medium- and Long-Term Goals", "abstract": "A comparative analysis of deep learning models and traditional statistical\nmethods for stock price prediction uses data from the Nigerian stock exchange.\nHistorical data, including daily prices and trading volumes, are employed to\nimplement models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and\nAutoregressive Moving Average (ARMA). These models are assessed over three-time\nhorizons: short-term (1 year), medium-term (2.5 years), and long-term (5\nyears), with performance measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute\nError (MAE). The stability of the time series is tested using the Augmented\nDickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Results reveal that deep learning models,\nparticularly LSTM, outperform traditional methods by capturing complex,\nnonlinear patterns in the data, resulting in more accurate predictions.\nHowever, these models require greater computational resources and offer less\ninterpretability than traditional approaches. The findings highlight the\npotential of deep learning for improving financial forecasting and investment\nstrategies. Future research could incorporate external factors such as social\nmedia sentiment and economic indicators, refine model architectures, and\nexplore real-time applications to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability.", "published": "2024-09-29 11:20:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07220v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Signal inference in financial stock return correlations through phase-ordering kinetics in the quenched regime", "abstract": "Financial stock return correlations have been analyzed through the lens of\nrandom matrix theory to differentiate the underlying signal from spurious\ncorrelations. The continuous spectrum of the eigenvalue distribution derived\nfrom the stock return correlation matrix typically aligns with a rescaled\nMarchenko-Pastur distribution, indicating no detectable signal. In this study,\nwe introduce a stochastic field theory model to establish a detection threshold\nfor signals present in the limit where the eigenvalues are within the\ncontinuous spectrum, which itself closely resembles that of a random matrix\nwhere standard methods such as principal component analysis fail to infer a\nsignal. We then apply our method to Standard & Poor's 500 financial stocks'\nreturn correlations, detecting the presence of a signal in the largest\neigenvalues within the continuous spectrum.", "published": "2024-09-29 14:07:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19711v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
