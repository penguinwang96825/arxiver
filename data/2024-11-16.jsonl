{"title": "Some Computations for Optimal Execution with Monotone Strategies", "abstract": "We study an optimal execution problem in the infinite horizon setup. Our\nfinancial market is given by the Black-Scholes model with a linear price\nimpact. The main novelty of the current note is that we study the constrained\ncase where the number of shares and the selling rate are non-negative\nprocesses. For this case we give a complete characterization of the value and\nthe optimal control via a solution of a non-linear ordinary differential\nequation (ODE). Furthermore, we provide an example where the non-linear ODE can\nbe solved explicitly. Our approach is purely probabilistic.", "published": "2024-11-16 07:30:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10726v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
