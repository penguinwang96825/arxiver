{"title": "Knowledge Transfer for Out-of-Knowledge-Base Entities: A Graph Neural\n  Network Approach", "abstract": "Knowledge base completion (KBC) aims to predict missing information in a\nknowledge base.In this paper, we address the out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB)\nentity problem in KBC:how to answer queries concerning test entities not\nobserved at training time. Existing embedding-based KBC models assume that all\ntest entities are available at training time, making it unclear how to obtain\nembeddings for new entities without costly retraining. To solve the OOKB entity\nproblem without retraining, we use graph neural networks (Graph-NNs) to compute\nthe embeddings of OOKB entities, exploiting the limited auxiliary knowledge\nprovided at test time.The experimental results show the effectiveness of our\nproposed model in the OOKB setting.Additionally, in the standard KBC setting in\nwhich OOKB entities are not involved, our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the WordNet dataset.

{"title": "Detecting Large Concept Extensions for Conceptual Analysis", "abstract": "When performing a conceptual analysis of a concept, philosophers are\ninterested in all forms of expression of a concept in a text---be it direct or\nindirect, explicit or implicit. In this paper, we experiment with topic-based\nmethods of automating the detection of concept expressions in order to\nfacilitate philosophical conceptual analysis. We propose six methods based on\nLDA, and evaluate them on a new corpus of court decision that we had annotated\nby experts and non-experts. Our results indicate that these methods can yield\nimportant improvements over the keyword heuristic, which is often used as a\nconcept detection heuristic in many contexts. While more work remains to be\ndone, this indicates that detecting concepts through topics can serve as a\ngeneral-purpose method for at least some forms of concept expression that are\nnot captured using naive keyword approaches.", "published": "2017-06-18 20:39:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05723v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Lexical representation explains cortical entrainment during speech\n  comprehension", "abstract": "Results from a recent neuroimaging study on spoken sentence comprehension\nhave been interpreted as evidence for cortical entrainment to hierarchical\nsyntactic structure. We present a simple computational model that predicts the\npower spectra from this study, even though the model's linguistic knowledge is\nrestricted to the lexical level, and word-level representations are not\ncombined into higher-level units (phrases or sentences). Hence, the cortical\nentrainment results can also be explained from the lexical properties of the\nstimuli, without recourse to hierarchical syntax.", "published": "2017-06-18 14:04:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05656v6", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "q-bio.NC"}
{"title": "Towards the Improvement of Automated Scientific Document Categorization\n  by Deep Learning", "abstract": "This master thesis describes an algorithm for automated categorization of\nscientific documents using deep learning techniques and compares the results to\nthe results of existing classification algorithms. As an additional goal a\nreusable API is to be developed allowing the automation of classification tasks\nin existing software. A design will be proposed using a convolutional neural\nnetwork as a classifier and integrating this into a REST based API. This is\nthen used as the basis for an actual proof of concept implementation presented\nas well in this thesis. It will be shown that the deep learning classifier\nprovides very good result in the context of multi-class document categorization\nand that it is feasible to integrate such classifiers into a larger ecosystem\nusing REST based services.", "published": "2017-06-18 20:29:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05719v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
