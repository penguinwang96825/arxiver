{"title": "Classification of Cellular Automata Rules Based on Their Properties", "abstract": "This paper presents a classification of Cellular Automata rules based on its properties at the nth iteration. Elaborate computer program has been designed to get the nth iteration for arbitrary 1-D or 2-D CA rules. Studies indicate that the figures at some particular iteration might be helpful for some specific application. The hardware circuit implementation can be done using opto-electronic components [1-7].", "published": "2009-05-12 06:53:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1769v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
