{"title": "Bidirectional LSTM-CRF for Clinical Concept Extraction", "abstract": "Extraction of concepts present in patient clinical records is an essential\nstep in clinical research. The 2010 i2b2/VA Workshop on Natural Language\nProcessing Challenges for clinical records presented concept extraction (CE)\ntask, with aim to identify concepts (such as treatments, tests, problems) and\nclassify them into predefined categories. State-of-the-art CE approaches\nheavily rely on hand crafted features and domain specific resources which are\nhard to collect and tune. For this reason, this paper employs bidirectional\nLSTM with CRF decoding initialized with general purpose off-the-shelf word\nembeddings for CE. The experimental results achieved on 2010 i2b2/VA reference\nstandard corpora using bidirectional LSTM CRF ranks closely with top ranked\nsystems.", "published": "2016-10-19 03:59:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05858v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "A Theme-Rewriting Approach for Generating Algebra Word Problems", "abstract": "Texts present coherent stories that have a particular theme or overall\nsetting, for example science fiction or western. In this paper, we present a\ntext generation method called {\\it rewriting} that edits existing\nhuman-authored narratives to change their theme without changing the underlying\nstory. We apply the approach to math word problems, where it might help\nstudents stay more engaged by quickly transforming all of their homework\nassignments to the theme of their favorite movie without changing the math\nconcepts that are being taught. Our rewriting method uses a two-stage decoding\nprocess, which proposes new words from the target theme and scores the\nresulting stories according to a number of factors defining aspects of\nsyntactic, semantic, and thematic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that the\nfinal stories typically represent the new theme well while still testing the\noriginal math concepts, outperforming a number of baselines. We also release a\nnew dataset of human-authored rewrites of math word problems in several themes.", "published": "2016-10-19 20:49:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06210v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Cross-Lingual Syntactic Transfer with Limited Resources", "abstract": "We describe a simple but effective method for cross-lingual syntactic\ntransfer of dependency parsers, in the scenario where a large amount of\ntranslation data is not available. The method makes use of three steps: 1) a\nmethod for deriving cross-lingual word clusters, which can then be used in a\nmultilingual parser; 2) a method for transferring lexical information from a\ntarget language to source language treebanks; 3) a method for integrating these\nsteps with the density-driven annotation projection method of Rasooli and\nCollins (2015). Experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art in\nseveral languages used in previous work, in a setting where the only source of\ntranslation data is the Bible, a considerably smaller corpus than the Europarl\ncorpus used in previous work. Results using the Europarl corpus as a source of\ntranslation data show additional improvements over the results of Rasooli and\nCollins (2015). We conclude with results on 38 datasets from the Universal\nDependencies corpora.", "published": "2016-10-19 21:25:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06227v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Bayesian Approach to Estimation of Speaker Normalization Parameters", "abstract": "In this work, a Bayesian approach to speaker normalization is proposed to\ncompensate for the degradation in performance of a speaker independent speech\nrecognition system. The speaker normalization method proposed herein uses the\ntechnique of vocal tract length normalization (VTLN). The VTLN parameters are\nestimated using a novel Bayesian approach which utilizes the Gibbs sampler, a\nspecial type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Additionally the\nhyperparameters are estimated using maximum likelihood approach. This model is\nused assuming that human vocal tract can be modeled as a tube of uniform cross\nsection. It captures the variation in length of the vocal tract of different\nspeakers more effectively, than the linear model used in literature. The work\nhas also investigated different methods like minimization of Mean Square Error\n(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the estimation of VTLN parameters. Both\nsingle pass and two pass approaches are then used to build a VTLN based speech\nrecognizer. Experimental results on recognition of vowels and Hindi phrases\nfrom a medium vocabulary indicate that the Bayesian method improves the\nperformance by a considerable margin.", "published": "2016-10-19 10:16:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05948v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
