{"title": "Independence Testing for Bounded Degree Bayesian Network", "abstract": "We study the following independence testing problem: given access to samples from a distribution $P$ over $\\{0,1\\}^n$, decide whether $P$ is a product distribution or whether it is $\\varepsilon$-far in total variation distance from any product distribution. For arbitrary distributions, this problem requires $\\exp(n)$ samples. We show in this work that if $P$ has a sparse structure, then in fact only linearly many samples are required. Specifically, if $P$ is Markov with respect to a Bayesian network whose underlying DAG has in-degree bounded by $d$, then $\\tilde\u0398(2^{d/2}\\cdot n/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary and sufficient for independence testing.", "published": "2022-04-19 06:16:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08690v2", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.DM", "cs.IT", "cs.LG", "math.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
