{"title": "Pricing American Parisian Options under General Time-Inhomogeneous Markov Models", "abstract": "This paper develops general approaches for pricing various types of\nAmerican-style Parisian options (down-in/-out, perpetual/finite-maturity) with\ngeneral payoff functions based on continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)\napproximation under general 1D time-inhomogeneous Markov models. For the\ndown-in types, by conditioning on the Parisian stopping time, we reduce the\npricing problem to that of a series of vanilla American options with different\nmaturities and their prices integrated with the distribution function of the\nParisian stopping time yield the American Parisian down-in option price. This\nfacilitates an efficient application of CTMC approximation to obtain the\napproximate option price by calculating the required quantities. For the\nperpetual down-in cases under time-homogeneous models, significant\ncomputational cost can be reduced. The down-out cases are more complicated, for\nwhich we use the state augmentation approach to record the excursion duration\nand then the approximate option price is obtained by solving a series of\nvariational inequalities recursively with the Lemke's pivoting method. We show\nthe convergence of CTMC approximation for all the types of American Parisian\noptions under general time-inhomogeneous Markov models, and the accuracy and\nefficiency of our algorithms are confirmed with extensive numerical\nexperiments.", "published": "2025-03-14 03:45:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11053v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Bridging Language Models and Financial Analysis", "abstract": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked\ntransformative possibilities in natural language processing, particularly\nwithin the financial sector. Financial data is often embedded in intricate\nrelationships across textual content, numerical tables, and visual charts,\nposing challenges that traditional methods struggle to address effectively.\nHowever, the emergence of LLMs offers new pathways for processing and analyzing\nthis multifaceted data with increased efficiency and insight. Despite the fast\npace of innovation in LLM research, there remains a significant gap in their\npractical adoption within the finance industry, where cautious integration and\nlong-term validation are prioritized. This disparity has led to a slower\nimplementation of emerging LLM techniques, despite their immense potential in\nfinancial applications. As a result, many of the latest advancements in LLM\ntechnology remain underexplored or not fully utilized in this domain. This\nsurvey seeks to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of recent\ndevelopments in LLM research and examining their applicability to the financial\nsector. Building on previous survey literature, we highlight several novel LLM\nmethodologies, exploring their distinctive capabilities and their potential\nrelevance to financial data analysis. By synthesizing insights from a broad\nrange of studies, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for\nresearchers and practitioners, offering direction on promising research avenues\nand outlining future opportunities for advancing LLM applications in finance.", "published": "2025-03-14 01:35:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22693v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
