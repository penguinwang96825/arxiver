{"title": "Characterizations of probe interval graphs", "abstract": "In this paper we obtain several characterizations of the adjacency matrix of a probe interval graph. In course of this study we describe an easy method of obtaining interval representation of an interval bipartite graph from its adjacency matrix. Finally, we note that if we add a loop at every probe vertex of a probe interval graph, then the Ferrers dimension of the corresponding symmetric bipartite graph is at most 3.", "published": "2008-11-17 11:17:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2675v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
