{"title": "Analysis of Named Entity Recognition and Linking for Tweets", "abstract": "Applying natural language processing for mining and intelligent information\naccess to tweets (a form of microblog) is a challenging, emerging research\narea. Unlike carefully authored news text and other longer content, tweets pose\na number of new challenges, due to their short, noisy, context-dependent, and\ndynamic nature. Information extraction from tweets is typically performed in a\npipeline, comprising consecutive stages of language identification,\ntokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and entity\ndisambiguation (e.g. with respect to DBpedia). In this work, we describe a new\nTwitter entity disambiguation dataset, and conduct an empirical analysis of\nnamed entity recognition and disambiguation, investigating how robust a number\nof state-of-the-art systems are on such noisy texts, what the main sources of\nerror are, and which problems should be further investigated to improve the\nstate of the art.", "published": "2014-10-27 11:09:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7182v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
