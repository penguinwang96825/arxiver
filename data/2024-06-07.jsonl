{"title": "An Algebraic Framework for the Modeling of Limit Order Books", "abstract": "Introducing an algebraic framework for modeling limit order books (LOBs) with\ntools from physics and stochastic processes, our proposed framework captures\nthe creation and annihilation of orders, order matching, and the time evolution\nof the LOB state. It also enables compositional settings, accommodating the\ninteraction of heterogeneous traders and different market structures. We employ\nDirac notation and generalized generating functions to describe the state space\nand dynamics of LOBs. The utility of this framework is shown through\nsimulations of simplified market scenarios, illustrating how variations in\ntrader behavior impact key market observables such as spread, return\nvolatility, and liquidity. The algebraic representation allows for exact\nsimulations using the Gillespie algorithm, providing a robust tool for\nexploring the implications of market design and policy changes on LOB dynamics.\nFuture research can expand this framework to incorporate more complex order\ntypes, adaptive event rates, and multi-asset trading environments, offering\ndeeper insights into market microstructure and trader behavior and estimation\nof key drivers for market microstructure dynamics.", "published": "2024-06-07 14:33:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04969v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.ST", "60G10, 62M10, 91B26, 65C40", "G.3; I.6.1; I.6.4; J.4"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
