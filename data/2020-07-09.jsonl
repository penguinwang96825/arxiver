{"title": "Enhancing spatial and textual analysis with EUPEG: an extensible and unified platform for evaluating geoparsers", "abstract": "A rich amount of geographic information exists in unstructured texts, such as Web pages, social media posts, housing advertisements, and historical archives. Geoparsers are useful tools that extract structured geographic information from unstructured texts, thereby enabling spatial analysis on textual data. While a number of geoparsers were developed, they were tested on different datasets using different metrics. Consequently, it is difficult to compare existing geoparsers or to compare a new geoparser with existing ones. In recent years, researchers created open and annotated corpora for testing geoparsers. While these corpora are extremely valuable, much effort is still needed for a researcher to prepare these datasets and deploy geoparsers for comparative experiments. This paper presents EUPEG: an Extensible and Unified Platform for Evaluating Geoparsers. EUPEG is an open source and Web based benchmarking platform which hosts a majority of open corpora, geoparsers, and performance metrics reported in the literature. It enables direct comparison of the hosted geoparsers, and a new geoparser can be connected to EUPEG and compared with other geoparsers. The main objective of EUPEG is to reduce the time and effort that researchers have to spend in preparing datasets and baselines, thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of comparative experiments.", "published": "2020-07-09 03:00:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04524v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Geometric Bounds for Convergence Rates of Averaging Algorithms", "abstract": "We develop a generic method for bounding the convergence rate of an averaging algorithm running in a multi-agent system with a time-varying network, where the associated stochastic matrices have a time-independent Perron vector. This method provides bounds on convergence rates that unify and refine most of the previously known bounds. They depend on geometric parameters of the dynamic communication graph such as the normalized diameter or the bottleneck measure.\n  As corollaries of these geometric bounds, we show that the convergence rate of the Metropolis algorithm in a system of $n$ agents is less than $1-1/4n^2$ with any communication graph that may vary in time, but is permanently connected and bidirectional. We prove a similar upper bound for the EqualNeighbor algorithm under the additional assumptions that the number of neighbors of each agent is constant and that the communication graph is not too irregular. Moreover our bounds offer improved convergence rates for several averaging algorithms and specific families of communication graphs. \n  Finally we extend our methodology to a time-varying Perron vector and show how convergence times may dramatically degrade with even limited variations of Perron vectors.", "published": "2020-07-09 14:35:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04837v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
