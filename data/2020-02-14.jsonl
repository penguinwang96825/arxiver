{"title": "Speaker Diarization with Region Proposal Network", "abstract": "Speaker diarization is an important pre-processing step for many speech applications, and it aims to solve the \"who spoke when\" problem. Although the standard diarization systems can achieve satisfactory results in various scenarios, they are composed of several independently-optimized modules and cannot deal with the overlapped speech. In this paper, we propose a novel speaker diarization method: Region Proposal Network based Speaker Diarization (RPNSD). In this method, a neural network generates overlapped speech segment proposals, and compute their speaker embeddings at the same time. Compared with standard diarization systems, RPNSD has a shorter pipeline and can handle the overlapped speech. Experimental results on three diarization datasets reveal that RPNSD achieves remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art x-vector baseline.", "published": "2020-02-14 19:17:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06220v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "An Adaptive X-vector Model for Text-independent Speaker Verification", "abstract": "In this paper, adaptive mechanisms are applied in deep neural network (DNN) training for x-vector-based text-independent speaker verification. First, adaptive convolutional neural networks (ACNNs) are employed in frame-level embedding layers, where the parameters of the convolution filters are adjusted based on the input features. Compared with conventional CNNs, ACNNs have more flexibility in capturing speaker information. Moreover, we replace conventional batch normalization (BN) with adaptive batch normalization (ABN). By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting parameters in BN, ABN adapts models to the acoustic variability arising from various factors such as channel and environmental noises. Finally, we incorporate these two methods to further improve performance. Experiments are carried out on the speaker in the wild (SITW) and VOiCES databases. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform the original x-vector approach.", "published": "2020-02-14 14:28:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06049v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
