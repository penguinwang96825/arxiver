{"title": "A Unified Tagging Solution: Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Network\n  with Word Embedding", "abstract": "Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM-RNN) has\nbeen shown to be very effective for modeling and predicting sequential data,\ne.g. speech utterances or handwritten documents. In this study, we propose to\nuse BLSTM-RNN for a unified tagging solution that can be applied to various\ntagging tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking and named entity\nrecognition. Instead of exploiting specific features carefully optimized for\neach task, our solution only uses one set of task-independent features and\ninternal representations learnt from unlabeled text for all tasks.Requiring no\ntask specific knowledge or sophisticated feature engineering, our approach gets\nnearly state-of-the-art performance in all these three tagging tasks.", "published": "2015-11-01 07:59:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00215v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
