{"title": "Read + Verify: Machine Reading Comprehension with Unanswerable Questions", "abstract": "Machine reading comprehension with unanswerable questions aims to abstain\nfrom answering when no answer can be inferred. In addition to extract answers,\nprevious works usually predict an additional \"no-answer\" probability to detect\nunanswerable cases. However, they fail to validate the answerability of the\nquestion by verifying the legitimacy of the predicted answer. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel read-then-verify system, which not only utilizes a\nneural reader to extract candidate answers and produce no-answer probabilities,\nbut also leverages an answer verifier to decide whether the predicted answer is\nentailed by the input snippets. Moreover, we introduce two auxiliary losses to\nhelp the reader better handle answer extraction as well as no-answer detection,\nand investigate three different architectures for the answer verifier. Our\nexperiments on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset show that our system achieves a score of\n74.2 F1 on the test set, achieving state-of-the-art results at the time of\nsubmission (Aug. 28th, 2018).", "published": "2018-08-17 05:18:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05759v5", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Disambiguating fine-grained place names from descriptions by clustering", "abstract": "Everyday place descriptions often contain place names of fine-grained\nfeatures, such as buildings or businesses, that are more difficult to\ndisambiguate than names referring to larger places, for example cities or\nnatural geographic features. Fine-grained places are often significantly more\nfrequent and more similar to each other, and disambiguation heuristics\ndeveloped for larger places, such as those based on population or containment\nrelationships, are often not applicable in these cases. In this research, we\naddress the disambiguation of fine-grained place names from everyday place\ndescriptions. For this purpose, we evaluate the performance of different\nexisting clustering-based approaches, since clustering approaches require no\nmore knowledge other than the locations of ambiguous place names. We consider\nnot only approaches developed specifically for place name disambiguation, but\nalso clustering algorithms developed for general data mining that could\npotentially be leveraged. We compare these methods with a novel algorithm, and\nshow that the novel algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of\ndisambiguation precision and distance error over several tested datasets.", "published": "2018-08-17 05:14:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05946v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Characterizing the public perception of WhatsApp through the lens of\n  media", "abstract": "WhatsApp is, as of 2018, a significant component of the global information\nand communication infrastructure, especially in developing countries. However,\nprobably due to its strong end-to-end encryption, WhatsApp became an attractive\nplace for the dissemination of misinformation, extremism and other forms of\nundesirable behavior. In this paper, we investigate the public perception of\nWhatsApp through the lens of media. We analyze two large datasets of news and\nshow the kind of content that is being associated with WhatsApp in different\nregions of the world and over time. Our analyses include the examination of\nnamed entities, general vocabulary, and topics addressed in news articles that\nmention WhatsApp, as well as the polarity of these texts. Among other results,\nwe demonstrate that the vocabulary and topics around the term \"whatsapp\" in the\nmedia have been changing over the years and in 2018 concentrate on matters\nrelated to misinformation, politics and criminal scams. More generally, our\nfindings are useful to understand the impact that tools like WhatsApp play in\nthe contemporary society and how they are seen by the communities themselves.", "published": "2018-08-17 16:47:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05927v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "What do the US West Coast Public Libraries Post on Twitter?", "abstract": "Twitter has provided a great opportunity for public libraries to disseminate\ninformation for a variety of purposes. Twitter data have been applied in\ndifferent domains such as health, politics, and history. There are thousands of\npublic libraries in the US, but no study has yet investigated the content of\ntheir social media posts like tweets to find their interests. Moreover,\ntraditional content analysis of Twitter content is not an efficient task for\nexploring thousands of tweets. Therefore, there is a need for automatic methods\nto overcome the limitations of manual methods. This paper proposes a\ncomputational approach to collecting and analyzing using Twitter Application\nProgramming Interfaces (API) and investigates more than 138,000 tweets from 48\nUS west coast libraries using topic modeling. We found 20 topics and assigned\nthem to five categories including public relations, book, event, training, and\nsocial good. Our results show that the US west coast libraries are more\ninterested in using Twitter for public relations and book-related events. This\nresearch has both practical and theoretical applications for libraries as well\nas other organizations to explore social media actives of their customer and\nthemselves.", "published": "2018-08-17 23:50:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06021v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL", "stat.AP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Learning Supervised Topic Models for Classification and Regression from\n  Crowds", "abstract": "The growing need to analyze large collections of documents has led to great\ndevelopments in topic modeling. Since documents are frequently associated with\nother related variables, such as labels or ratings, much interest has been\nplaced on supervised topic models. However, the nature of most annotation\ntasks, prone to ambiguity and noise, often with high volumes of documents, deem\nlearning under a single-annotator assumption unrealistic or unpractical for\nmost real-world applications. In this article, we propose two supervised topic\nmodels, one for classification and another for regression problems, which\naccount for the heterogeneity and biases among different annotators that are\nencountered in practice when learning from crowds.

{"title": "Unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation for acoustic scene\n  classification", "abstract": "A general problem in acoustic scene classification task is the mismatched\nconditions between training and testing data, which significantly reduces the\nperformance of the developed methods on classification accuracy.

We use a freely available dataset\nfrom the DCASE 2018 challenge Task 1, subtask B, that contains data from\nmismatched recording devices. We consider the scenario where the annotations\nare available for the data recorded from one device, but not for the rest.

{"title": "A study on speech enhancement using exponent-only floating point\n  quantized neural network (EOFP-QNN)", "abstract": "Numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of neural network\nquantization on pattern classification tasks. The present study, for the first\ntime, investigated the performance of speech enhancement (a regression task in\nspeech processing) using a novel exponent-only floating-point quantized neural\nnetwork (EOFP-QNN). The proposed EOFP-QNN consists of two stages:\nmantissa-quantization and exponent-quantization. In the mantissa-quantization\nstage, EOFP-QNN learns how to quantize the mantissa bits of the model\nparameters while preserving the regression accuracy using the least mantissa\nprecision. In the exponent-quantization stage, the exponent part of the\nparameters is further quantized without causing any additional performance\ndegradation. We evaluated the proposed EOFP quantization technique on two types\nof neural networks, namely, bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and\nfully convolutional neural network (FCN), on a speech enhancement task.\nExperimental results showed that the model sizes can be significantly reduced\n(the model sizes of the quantized BLSTM and FCN models were only 18.75% and\n21.89%, respectively, compared to those of the original models) while\nmaintaining satisfactory speech-enhancement performance.", "published": "2018-08-17 11:44:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06474v4", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.SD", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
