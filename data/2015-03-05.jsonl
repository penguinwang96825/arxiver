{"title": "Studying the Wikipedia Hyperlink Graph for Relatedness and\n  Disambiguation", "abstract": "Hyperlinks and other relations in Wikipedia are a extraordinary resource\nwhich is still not fully understood. In this paper we study the different types\nof links in Wikipedia, and contrast the use of the full graph with respect to\njust direct links. We apply a well-known random walk algorithm on two tasks,\nword relatedness and named-entity disambiguation. We show that using the full\ngraph is more effective than just direct links by a large margin, that\nnon-reciprocal links harm performance, and that there is no benefit from\ncategories and infoboxes, with coherent results on both tasks. We set new\nstate-of-the-art figures for systems based on Wikipedia links, comparable to\nsystems exploiting several information sources and/or supervised machine\nlearning. Our approach is open source, with instruction to reproduce results,\nand amenable to be integrated with complementary text-based methods.", "published": "2015-03-05 15:08:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01655v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Visualization of Clandestine Labs from Seizure Reports: Thematic Mapping\n  and Data Mining Research Directions", "abstract": "The problem of spatiotemporal event visualization based on reports entails\nsubtasks ranging from named entity recognition to relationship extraction and\nmapping of events. We present an approach to event extraction that is driven by\ndata mining and visualization goals, particularly thematic mapping and trend\nanalysis. This paper focuses on bridging the information extraction and\nvisualization tasks and investigates topic modeling approaches. We develop a\nstatic, finite topic model and examine the potential benefits and feasibility\nof extending this to dynamic topic modeling with a large number of topics and\ncontinuous time. We describe an experimental test bed for event mapping that\nuses this end-to-end information retrieval system, and report preliminary\nresults on a geoinformatics problem: tracking of methamphetamine lab seizure\nevents across time and space.", "published": "2015-03-05 06:22:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01549v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "What's Cookin'? Interpreting Cooking Videos using Text, Speech and\n  Vision", "abstract": "We present a novel method for aligning a sequence of instructions to a video\nof someone carrying out a task. In particular, we focus on the cooking domain,\nwhere the instructions correspond to the recipe. Our technique relies on an HMM\nto align the recipe steps to the (automatically generated) speech transcript.\nWe then refine this alignment using a state-of-the-art visual food detector,\nbased on a deep convolutional neural network. We show that our technique\noutperforms simpler techniques based on keyword spotting. It also enables\ninteresting applications, such as automatically illustrating recipes with\nkeyframes, and searching within a video for events of interest.", "published": "2015-03-05 07:07:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01558v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
