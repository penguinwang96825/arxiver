{"title": "AppTechMiner: Mining Applications and Techniques from Scientific\n  Articles", "abstract": "This paper presents AppTechMiner, a rule-based information extraction\nframework that automatically constructs a knowledge base of all application\nareas and problem solving techniques. Techniques include tools, methods,\ndatasets or evaluation metrics. We also categorize individual research articles\nbased on their application areas and the techniques proposed/improved in the\narticle. Our system achieves high average precision (~82%) and recall (~84%) in\nknowledge base creation. It also performs well in application and technique\nassignment to an individual article (average accuracy ~66%). In the end, we\nfurther present two use cases presenting a trivial information retrieval system\nand an extensive temporal analysis of the usage of techniques and application\nareas. At present, we demonstrate the framework for the domain of computational\nlinguistics but this can be easily generalized to any other field of research.", "published": "2017-09-10 07:56:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03064v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Debbie, the Debate Bot of the Future", "abstract": "Chatbots are a rapidly expanding application of dialogue systems with\ncompanies switching to bot services for customer support, and new applications\nfor users interested in casual conversation. One style of casual conversation\nis argument, many people love nothing more than a good argument. Moreover,\nthere are a number of existing corpora of argumentative dialogues, annotated\nfor agreement and disagreement, stance, sarcasm and argument quality. This\npaper introduces Debbie, a novel arguing bot, that selects arguments from\nconversational corpora, and aims to use them appropriately in context.

{"title": "Data-Driven Dialogue Systems for Social Agents", "abstract": "In order to build dialogue systems to tackle the ambitious task of holding\nsocial conversations, we argue that we need a data driven approach that\nincludes insight into human conversational chit chat, and which incorporates\ndifferent natural language processing modules. Our strategy is to analyze and\nindex large corpora of social media data, including Twitter conversations,\nonline debates, dialogues between friends, and blog posts, and then to couple\nthis data retrieval with modules that perform tasks such as sentiment and style\nanalysis, topic modeling, and summarization. We aim for personal assistants\nthat can learn more nuanced human language, and to grow from task-oriented\nagents to more personable social bots.", "published": "2017-09-10 22:37:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03190v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Abductive Matching in Question Answering", "abstract": "We study question-answering over semi-structured data. We introduce a new way\nto apply the technique of semantic parsing by applying machine learning only to\nprovide annotations that the system infers to be missing; all the other parsing\nlogic is in the form of manually authored rules. In effect, the machine\nlearning is used to provide non-syntactic matches, a step that is ill-suited to\nmanual rules. The advantage of this approach is in its debuggability and in its\ntransparency to the end-user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach\nby achieving state-of-the-art performance of 40.42% accuracy on a standard\nbenchmark dataset over tables from Wikipedia.", "published": "2017-09-10 03:42:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03036v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "I.2.1; H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A New Semantic Theory of Natural Language", "abstract": "Formal Semantics and Distributional Semantics are two important semantic\nframeworks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Cognitive Semantics belongs to\nthe movement of Cognitive Linguistics, which is based on contemporary cognitive\nscience. Each framework could deal with some meaning phenomena, but none of\nthem fulfills all requirements proposed by applications. A unified semantic\ntheory characterizing all important language phenomena has both theoretical and\npractical significance; however, although many attempts have been made in\nrecent years, no existing theory has achieved this goal yet.\n  This article introduces a new semantic theory that has the potential to\ncharacterize most of the important meaning phenomena of natural language and to\nfulfill most of the necessary requirements for philosophical analysis and for\nNLP applications. The theory is based on a unified representation of\ninformation, and constructs a kind of mathematical model called cognitive model\nto interpret natural language expressions in a compositional manner. It accepts\nthe empirical assumption of Cognitive Semantics, and overcomes most\nshortcomings of Formal Semantics and of Distributional Semantics. The theory,\nhowever, is not a simple combination of existing theories, but an extensive\ngeneralization of classic logic and Formal Semantics. It inherits nearly all\nadvantages of Formal Semantics, and also provides descriptive contents for\nobjects and events as fine-gram as possible, descriptive contents which\nrepresent the results of human cognition.", "published": "2017-09-10 13:18:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04857v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
