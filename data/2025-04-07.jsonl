We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the\nalignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these\nexplanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides\nalignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response\nand the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering\nto safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to\nassess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the\ngenerated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in \"reward hacking\" by\nproducing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation\ntailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To\naddress this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal\nattribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between\nthe generated self-explanation and the model's decision process.

In this paper, we ask:\nHow can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most\nfacial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake\ngenerators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting\ninconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach\" the detector to\nlearn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to\nelaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and\ngeneral artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize\ndeepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face\nInconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from\nthe challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing\ninconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform\nsurrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by\nthe generator's decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization\nstems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or\nboth of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level\npseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA\nand USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we\nemploy a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module\nthat uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the\nFIA.

This paper\nproposes a novel multi-view clustering framework that introduces a disentangled\nvariational autoencoder that separates multi-view into shared and private\ninformation, i.e., consistency and complementarity information. We first learn\ninformative and consistent representations by maximizing mutual information\nacross different views through contrastive learning. This process will ignore\ncomplementary information. Then, we employ consistency inference constraints to\nexplicitly utilize complementary information when attempting to seek the\nconsistency of shared information across all views. Specifically, we perform a\nwithin-reconstruction using the private and shared information of each view and\na cross-reconstruction using the shared information of all views. The dual\nconsistency constraints are not only effective in improving the representation\nquality of data but also easy to extend to other scenarios, especially in\ncomplex multi-view scenes. This could be the first attempt to employ dual\nconsistent constraint in a unified MVC theoretical framework. During the\ntraining procedure, the consistency and complementarity features are jointly\noptimized.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient and adjustable\ndeepJSCC model for image transmission, which we call feature importance-aware\ndeepJSCC (FAJSCC). Unlike existing deepJSCC models that equally process all\nneural features of images, FAJSCC first classifies features into important and\nless important features and then processes them differently. Specifically,\ncomputationally-intensive self-attention is applied to the important features\nand computationally-efficient spatial attention to the less important ones. The\nfeature classification is based on the available computational budget and\nimportance scores predicted by an importance predictor, which estimates each\nfeature's contribution to performance.

{"title": "Sub-Clustering for Class Distance Recalculation in Long-Tailed Drug Classification", "abstract": "In the real world, long-tailed data distributions are prevalent, making it\nchallenging for models to effectively learn and classify tail classes. However,\nwe discover that in the field of drug chemistry, certain tail classes exhibit\nhigher identifiability during training due to their unique molecular structural\nfeatures, a finding that significantly contrasts with the conventional\nunderstanding that tail classes are generally difficult to identify. Existing\nimbalance learning methods, such as resampling and cost-sensitive reweighting,\noverly rely on sample quantity priors, causing models to excessively focus on\ntail classes at the expense of head class performance. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel method that breaks away from the traditional static\nevaluation paradigm based on sample size. Instead, we establish a dynamical\ninter-class separability metric using feature distances between different\nclasses. Specifically, we employ a sub-clustering contrastive learning approach\nto thoroughly learn the embedding features of each class, and we dynamically\ncompute the distances between class embeddings to capture the relative\npositional evolution of samples from different classes in the feature space,\nthereby rebalancing the weights of the classification loss function.

To this end, this paper addresses\nminimizing average EMF exposure while maintaining coverage in a 3D urban\nscenario by jointly optimizing BS deployment and power. To address this,\nfirstly, accurate EMF prediction is essential, as traditional empirical models\nlack the required accuracy, necessitating a deterministic channel model. A\nnovel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) algorithm is\ntherefore developed to overcome several limitations of current simulators and\nis validated with real-world measurements. Secondly, to further reduce\ncomputational complexity, unlike using a fixed grid size to discretize the\ntarget area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed with a\nflexible grid to predict the overall EMF exposure. Finally, based on the EMF\nexposure predictions, the Nelder-Mead (NM) method is used in the joint\noptimization, and urban user equipment (UE) distributions are incorporated to\nbetter reflect real-world conditions.

Wilkinson power\ndivider (WPD) is the traditional power division approach using\nquarter-wavelength transmission lines [1]. This type of power divider is\npopularly used in communication systems due to its good electrical isolation\nand simple structure. The problem with WPD is that its operation requires the\nuse of an externally connected bandpass filter (BPF) to achieve filtering\nfunctionality. This leads to increased footprint and increased loss\ncoefficients in a system. In contrast to the traditional design approach\ninvolving a BPF, a matching transmission line, and a Wilkinson power divider as\nseparate components, the proposed integrated filtering power divider (FPD)\nconsolidates all three components into a single device, leading to lower\nfootprint and lower loss coefficient in a system.
