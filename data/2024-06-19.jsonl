{"title": "Adaptive Curves for Optimally Efficient Market Making", "abstract": "Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nas they match liquidity supply with demand. They function through liquidity\nproviders (LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools. However, the asset\ntrading prices in these pools often trail behind those in more dynamic,\ncentralized exchanges, leading to potential arbitrage losses for LPs. This\nissue is tackled by adapting market maker bonding curves to trader behavior,\nbased on the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. Our\napproach ensures a zero-profit condition for the market maker's prices. We\nderive the differential equation that an optimal adaptive curve should follow\nto minimize arbitrage losses while remaining competitive. Solutions to this\noptimality equation are obtained for standard Gaussian and Lognormal price\nmodels using Kalman filtering. A key feature of our method is its ability to\nestimate the external market price without relying on price or loss oracles. We\nalso provide an equivalent differential equation for the implied dynamics of\ncanonical static bonding curves and establish conditions for their optimality.\nOur algorithms demonstrate robustness to changing market conditions and\nadversarial perturbations, and we offer an on-chain implementation using\nUniswap v4 alongside off-chain AI co-processors.", "published": "2024-06-19 19:42:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13794v2", "categories": ["eess.SY", "cs.CE", "cs.SY", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "eess.SY"}
