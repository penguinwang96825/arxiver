{"title": "Generalized Beta Prime Distribution: Stochastic Model of Economic Exchange and Properties of Inequality Indices", "abstract": "We argue that a stochastic model of economic exchange, whose steady-state distribution is a Generalized Beta Prime (also known as GB2), and some unique properties of the latter, are the reason for GB2's success in describing wealth/income distributions. We use housing sale prices as a proxy to wealth/income distribution to numerically illustrate this point. We also explore parametric limits of the distribution to do so analytically. We discuss parametric properties of the inequality indices -- Gini, Hoover, Theil T and Theil L -- vis-a-vis those of GB2 and introduce a new inequality index, which serves a similar purpose. We argue that Hoover and Theil L are more appropriate measures for distributions with power-law dependencies, especially fat tails, such as GB2.", "published": "2019-06-11 21:17:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04822v1", "categories": ["econ.EM", "econ.TH", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "econ.EM"}
