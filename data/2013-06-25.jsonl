{"title": "A Computational Approach to Politeness with Application to Social\n  Factors", "abstract": "We propose a computational framework for identifying linguistic aspects of\npoliteness. Our starting point is a new corpus of requests annotated for\npoliteness, which we use to evaluate aspects of politeness theory and to\nuncover new interactions between politeness markers and context. These findings\nguide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and\nsyntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such\nas indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier\nachieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our\nframework to study the relationship between politeness and social power,\nshowing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status\nthrough elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a\nsimilar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange,\nwhere users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at\nthe bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of\npoliteness variation by gender and community.", "published": "2013-06-25 20:00:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6078v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
