{"title": "An Inventory of Preposition Relations", "abstract": "We describe an inventory of semantic relations that are expressed by\nprepositions. We define these relations by building on the word sense\ndisambiguation task for prepositions and propose a mapping from preposition\nsenses to the relation labels by collapsing semantically related senses across\nprepositions.", "published": "2013-05-24 16:34:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5785v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Development of a Hindi Lemmatizer", "abstract": "We live in a translingual society, in order to communicate with people from\ndifferent parts of the world we need to have an expertise in their respective\nlanguages. Learning all these languages is not at all possible; therefore we\nneed a mechanism which can do this task for us. Machine translators have\nemerged as a tool which can perform this task. In order to develop a machine\ntranslator we need to develop several different rules. The very first module\nthat comes in machine translation pipeline is morphological analysis. Stemming\nand lemmatization comes under morphological analysis. In this paper we have\ncreated a lemmatizer which generates rules for removing the affixes along with\nthe addition of rules for creating a proper root word.", "published": "2013-05-24 18:01:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6211v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
