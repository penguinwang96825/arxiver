{"title": "Necessary and Sufficient Conditions and a Provably Efficient Algorithm\n  for Separable Topic Discovery", "abstract": "We develop necessary and sufficient conditions and a novel provably\nconsistent and efficient algorithm for discovering topics (latent factors) from\nobservations (documents) that are realized from a probabilistic mixture of\nshared latent factors that have certain properties. Our focus is on the class\nof topic models in which each shared latent factor contains a novel word that\nis unique to that factor, a property that has come to be known as separability.\nOur algorithm is based on the key insight that the novel words correspond to\nthe extreme points of the convex hull formed by the row-vectors of a suitably\nnormalized word co-occurrence matrix. We leverage this geometric insight to\nestablish polynomial computation and sample complexity bounds based on a few\nisotropic random projections of the rows of the normalized word co-occurrence\nmatrix. Our proposed random-projections-based algorithm is naturally amenable\nto an efficient distributed implementation and is attractive for modern\nweb-scale distributed data mining applications.", "published": "2015-08-23 03:44:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05565v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
