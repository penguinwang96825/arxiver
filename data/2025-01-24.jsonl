{"title": "A Space Mapping approach for the calibration of financial models with the application to the Heston model", "abstract": "We present a novel approach for parameter calibration of the Heston model for\npricing an Asian put option, namely space mapping. Since few parameters of the\nHeston model can be directly extracted from real market data, calibration to\nreal market data is implicit and therefore a challenging task. In addition,\nsome of the parameters in the model are non-linear, which makes it difficult to\nfind the global minimum of the optimization problem within the calibration. Our\napproach is based on the idea of space mapping, exploiting the residuum of a\ncoarse surrogate model that allows optimization and a fine model that needs to\nbe calibrated. In our case, the pricing of an Asian option using the Heston\nmodel SDE is the fine model, and the surrogate is chosen to be the Heston model\nPDE pricing a European option. We formally derive a gradient descent algorithm\nfor the PDE constrained calibration model using well-known techniques from\noptimization with PDEs. Our main goal is to provide evidence that the space\nmapping approach can be useful in financial calibration tasks. Numerical\nresults underline the feasibility of our approach.", "published": "2025-01-24 14:24:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14521v1", "categories": ["math.NA", "cs.NA", "q-fin.CP", "65M06, 65K10, 91-08"], "primary_category": "math.NA"}
{"title": "Optimal Investment under Mutual Strategy Influence among Agents", "abstract": "In financial markets, agents often mutually influence each other's investment\nstrategies and adjust their strategies to align with others. However, there is\nlimited quantitative study of agents' investment strategies in such scenarios.\nIn this work, we formulate the optimal investment differential game problem to\nstudy the mutual influence among agents. We derive the analytical solutions for\nagents' optimal strategies and propose a fast algorithm to find approximate\nsolutions with low computational complexity. We theoretically analyze the\nimpact of mutual influence on agents' optimal strategies and terminal wealth.\nWhen the mutual influence is strong and approaches infinity, we show that\nagents' optimal strategies converge to the asymptotic strategy. Furthermore, in\ngeneral cases, we prove that agents' optimal strategies are linear combinations\nof the asymptotic strategy and their rational strategies without others'\ninfluence. We validate the performance of the fast algorithm and verify the\ncorrectness of our analysis using numerical experiments. This work is crucial\nto comprehend mutual influence among agents and design effective mechanisms to\nguide their strategies in financial markets.", "published": "2025-01-24 05:58:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14259v1", "categories": ["eess.SY", "cs.SY", "math.OC", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "eess.SY"}
