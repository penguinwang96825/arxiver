{"title": "Probabilistic Models for High-Order Projective Dependency Parsing", "abstract": "This paper presents generalized probabilistic models for high-order\nprojective dependency parsing and an algorithmic framework for learning these\nstatistical models involving dependency trees. Partition functions and\nmarginals for high-order dependency trees can be computed efficiently, by\nadapting our algorithms which extend the inside-outside algorithm to\nhigher-order cases. To show the effectiveness of our algorithms, we perform\nexperiments on three languages---English, Chinese and Czech, using maximum\nconditional likelihood estimation for model training and L-BFGS for parameter\nestimation. Our methods achieve competitive performance for English, and\noutperform all previously reported dependency parsers for Chinese and Czech.", "published": "2015-02-14 06:47:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04174v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
