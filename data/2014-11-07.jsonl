{"title": "Azhary: An Arabic Lexical Ontology", "abstract": "Arabic language is the most spoken languages in the Semitic languages group,\nand one of the most common languages in the world spoken by more than 422\nmillion. It is also of paramount importance to Muslims, it is a sacred language\nof the Islamic Holly Book (Quran) and prayer (and other acts of worship) in\nIslam is performed only by mastering some of Arabic words. Arabic is also a\nmajor ritual language of a number of Christian churches in the Arab world and\nit is also used in writing several intellectual and religious Jewish books in\nthe Middle Ages. Despite this, there is no semantic Arabic lexicon which\nresearchers can depend on. In this paper we introduce Azhary as a lexical\nontology for the Arabic language. It groups Arabic words into sets of synonyms\ncalled synsets, and records a number of relationships between words such as\nsynonym, antonym, hypernym, hyponym, meronym, holonym and association\nrelations. The ontology contains 26,195 words organized in 13,328 synsets. It\nhas been developed and contrasted against AWN which is the most common\navailable Arabic lexical ontology.", "published": "2014-11-07 18:23:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1999v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
