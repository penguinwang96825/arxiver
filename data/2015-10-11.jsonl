{"title": "A Diversity-Promoting Objective Function for Neural Conversation Models", "abstract": "Sequence-to-sequence neural network models for generation of conversational\nresponses tend to generate safe, commonplace responses (e.g., \"I don't know\")\nregardless of the input. We suggest that the traditional objective function,\ni.e., the likelihood of output (response) given input (message) is unsuited to\nresponse generation tasks. Instead we propose using Maximum Mutual Information\n(MMI) as the objective function in neural models. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed MMI models produce more diverse, interesting, and\nappropriate responses, yielding substantive gains in BLEU scores on two\nconversational datasets and in human evaluations.", "published": "2015-10-11 14:04:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03055v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Textual Analysis for Studying Chinese Historical Documents and Literary\n  Novels", "abstract": "We analyzed historical and literary documents in Chinese to gain insights\ninto research issues, and overview our studies which utilized four different\nsources of text materials in this paper. We investigated the history of\nconcepts and transliterated words in China with the Database for the Study of\nModern China Thought and Literature, which contains historical documents about\nChina between 1830 and 1930. We also attempted to disambiguate names that were\nshared by multiple government officers who served between 618 and 1912 and were\nrecorded in Chinese local gazetteers. To showcase the potentials and challenges\nof computer-assisted analysis of Chinese literatures, we explored some\ninteresting yet non-trivial questions about two of the Four Great Classical\nNovels of China: (1) Which monsters attempted to consume the Buddhist monk\nXuanzang in the Journey to the West (JTTW), which was published in the 16th\ncentury, (2) Which was the most powerful monster in JTTW, and (3) Which major\nrole smiled the most in the Dream of the Red Chamber, which was published in\nthe 18th century. Similar approaches can be applied to the analysis and study\nof modern documents, such as the newspaper articles published about the 228\nincident that occurred in 1947 in Taiwan.", "published": "2015-10-11 07:45:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03021v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
