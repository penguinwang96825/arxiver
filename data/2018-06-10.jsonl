{"title": "Smart Novel Computer-based Analytical Tool for Image Forgery Authentication", "abstract": "This paper presents an integration of image forgery detection with image facial recognition using black propagation neural network (BPNN). We observed that facial image recognition by itself will always give a matching output or closest possible output image for every input image irrespective of the authenticity or otherwise not of the testing input image. Based on this, we are proposing the combination of the blind but powerful automation image forgery detection for entire input images for the BPNN recognition program. Hence, an input image must first be authenticated before being fed into the recognition program. Thus, an image security identification and authentication requirement, any image that fails the authentication/verification stage are not to be used as an input/test image. In addition, the universal smart GUI tool is proposed and designed to perform image forgery detection with the high accuracy of 2% error rate.", "published": "2018-06-10 14:07:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04576v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "On The Calibration of Short-Term Interest Rates Through a CIR Model", "abstract": "It is well known that the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic model to study the term structure of interest rates, as introduced in 1985, is inadequate for modelling the current market environment with negative short interest rates. Moreover, the diffusion term in the rate dynamics goes to zero when short rates are small; both volatility and long-run mean do not change with time; they do not fit with the skewed (fat tails) distribution of the interest rates, etc. The aim of the present work is to suggest a new framework, which we call the CIR\\# model, that well fits the term structure of short interest rates so that the market volatility structure is preserved as well as the analytical tractability of the original CIR model.", "published": "2018-06-10 16:39:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03683v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Smallify: Learning Network Size while Training", "abstract": "As neural networks become widely deployed in different applications and on different hardware, it has become increasingly important to optimize inference time and model size along with model accuracy. Most current techniques optimize model size, model accuracy and inference time in different stages, resulting in suboptimal results and computational inefficiency. In this work, we propose a new technique called Smallify that optimizes all three of these metrics at the same time. Specifically we present a new method to simultaneously optimize network size and model performance by neuron-level pruning during training. Neuron-level pruning not only produces much smaller networks but also produces dense weight matrices that are amenable to efficient inference. By applying our technique to convolutional as well as fully connected models, we show that Smallify can reduce network size by 35X with a 6X improvement in inference time with similar accuracy as models found by traditional training techniques.", "published": "2018-06-10 20:58:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03723v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Smart GSM Based Home Automation System", "abstract": "This research work investigates the potential of Full Home Control, which is the aim of the Home Automation Systems in near future. The analysis and implementation of the home automation technology using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modem to control home appliances such as light, conditional system, and security system via Short Message Service (SMS) text messages is presented in this paper. The proposed research work is focused on the functionality of the GSM protocol, which allows the user to control the target system away from residential using the frequency bandwidths. The concept of serial communication and AT-commands has been applied towards the development of the smart GSM-based home automation system. Homeowners will be able to receive feedback status of any home appliances under control whether switched on or off remotely from their mobile phones. PIC16F887 microcontroller with the integration of GSM provides the smart automated house system with the desired baud rate of 9600 bps. The proposed prototype of GSM based home automation system was implemented and tested with a maximum of four loads and shows the accuracy of greater or equal 98%.", "published": "2018-06-10 19:53:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03715v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Static Quantized Radix-2 FFT/IFFT Processor for Constraints Analysis", "abstract": "This research work focuses on the design of a high-resolution fast Fourier transform (FFT) /inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) processors for constraints analysis purpose. Amongst the major setbacks associated with such high resolution, FFT processors are the high power consumption resulting from the structural complexity and computational inefficiency of floating-point calculations. As such, a parallel pipelined architecture was proposed to statically scale the resolution of the processor to suite adequate trade-off constraints. The quantization was applied to provide an approximation to address the finite word-length constraints of digital signal processing (DSP). An optimum operating mode was proposed, based on the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) as well as the statistical theory of quantization, to minimize the tradeoff issues associated with selecting the most application-efficient floating-point processing capability in contrast to their resolution quality.", "published": "2018-06-10 20:00:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03716v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.AR"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
