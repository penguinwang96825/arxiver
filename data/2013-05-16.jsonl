{"title": "Rule-Based Semantic Tagging. An Application Undergoing Dictionary\n  Glosses", "abstract": "The project presented in this article aims to formalize criteria and\nprocedures in order to extract semantic information from parsed dictionary\nglosses. The actual purpose of the project is the generation of a semantic\nnetwork (nearly an ontology) issued from a monolingual Italian dictionary,\nthrough unsupervised procedures. Since the project involves rule-based Parsing,\nSemantic Tagging and Word Sense Disambiguation techniques, its outcomes may\nfind an interest also beyond this immediate intent. The cooperation of both\nsyntactic and semantic features in meaning construction are investigated, and\nprocedures which allows a translation of syntactic dependencies in semantic\nrelations are discussed. The procedures that rise from this project can be\napplied also to other text types than dictionary glosses, as they convert the\noutput of a parsing process into a semantic representation. In addition some\nmechanism are sketched that may lead to a kind of procedural semantics, through\nwhich multiple paraphrases of an given expression can be generated. Which means\nthat these techniques may find an application also in 'query expansion'\nstrategies, interesting Information Retrieval, Search Engines and Question\nAnswering Systems.", "published": "2013-05-16 18:09:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3882v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
