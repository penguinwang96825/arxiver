We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that\ntransforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where\none model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and\ndefends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the\ncorrect solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates.

However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL.

While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to\nthe heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),\ncomputational node capabilities, and environmental impact.\n  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a\ndata-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on\nreducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.\nOur methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated\ndatasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,\nand the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We\ndevelop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric\nfactors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon\nemissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive\nrecommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,\nminimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to\ntime series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the\nenvironmental impact of FL tasks.", "published": "2025-07-23 06:18:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17241v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.DB", "cs.DC"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

The proposed SA-WiSense framework is\ncost-efficient, as only a single antenna is used rather than multiple antennas\nas in the previous works. Therefore, the proposed framework is applicable to\nInternet of Thing (IoT), where most of sensors are equipped with a single\nantenna. On one hand, we propose a cross-subcarrier channel state information\n(CSI) ratio (CSCR) based blind spot mitigation approach for IoT, where the\nratios of two values of CSI between subcarriers are leveraged to mitigate\nrandom phase offsets. We prove that the random phase offsets can be cancelled\nby the proposed CSCR approach, thereby restoring the inherent complementarity\nof signals for blind-spot-free sensing.

To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our\nextensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that\nmasking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and\nsignificantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual\nnavigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward\ncrop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and\ngeneralizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction\nin prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the\nnumber of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks\nto maximize overall performance.", "published": "2025-07-23 17:41:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17727v2", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}

The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance.

Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP).

We identify key challenges rooted in Tigrinya's\nmorphological complexity and resource scarcity, while highlighting promising\nresearch directions, including morphology-aware modeling, cross-lingual\ntransfer, and community-centered resource development. This work serves as both\na comprehensive reference for researchers and a roadmap for advancing Tigrinya\nNLP. A curated metadata of the surveyed studies and resources is made publicly\navailable.\\footnote{Tigrinya NLP Anthology:\nhttps://github.com/fgaim/tigrinya-nlp-anthology.", "published": "2025-07-23 22:45:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17974v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Previous studies have\nmainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying\naccuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature\nabout DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we\ninvestigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text\nClassifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can\nconsistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied\nadversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more\nsamples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy\nimpact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack\nwas humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and\n52% for GPTZero.

{"title": "Failure Prediction in Conversational Recommendation Systems", "abstract": "In a Conversational Image Recommendation task, users can provide natural\nlanguage feedback on a recommended image item, which leads to an improved\nrecommendation in the next turn. While typical instantiations of this task\nassume that the user's target item will (eventually) be returned, this might\noften not be true, for example, the item the user seeks is not within the item\ncatalogue. Failing to return a user's desired item can lead to user\nfrustration, as the user needs to interact with the system for an increased\nnumber of turns. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we introduce the task\nof Supervised Conversational Performance Prediction, inspired by Query\nPerformance Prediction (QPP) for predicting effectiveness in response to a\nsearch engine query. In this regard, we propose predictors for conversational\nperformance that detect conversation failures using multi-turn semantic\ninformation contained in the embedded representations of retrieved image items.\nSpecifically, our AutoEncoder-based predictor learns a compressed\nrepresentation of top-retrieved items of the train turns and uses the\nclassification labels to predict the evaluation turn.

In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is\npresented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using\natomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a\nhigh-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,\nand symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to\nexpose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,\nunsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous\natoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with\nmultidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a\nminimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various\ntests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only\nthree order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.\nBased on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as\nthe logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal\nthroughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance\n(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient\non-the-fly computation of crystallinity.

{"title": "Benchmarking of Deep Learning Methods for Generic MRI Multi-Organ Abdominal Segmentation", "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for\nsegmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the\ninherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating\ntraining datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of\nMRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the\nlandscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive\nbenchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:\nMRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these\nmodels are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also\nintroduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on\nwidely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess\naccuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by\nany of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major\nmanufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,\nvoxel resolutions, and fields-of-view.

Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input\nembedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout\nthe document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The\nproposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and\nmulti-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,\nindependent of their positions within the document.
