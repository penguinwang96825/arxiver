{"title": "New Perspectives in Sinographic Language Processing Through the Use of\n  Character Structure", "abstract": "Chinese characters have a complex and hierarchical graphical structure\ncarrying both semantic and phonetic information. We use this structure to\nenhance the text model and obtain better results in standard NLP operations.\nFirst of all, to tackle the problem of graphical variation we define\nallographic classes of characters. Next, the relation of inclusion of a\nsubcharacter in a characters, provides us with a directed graph of allographic\nclasses. We provide this graph with two weights: semanticity (semantic relation\nbetween subcharacter and character) and phoneticity (phonetic relation) and\ncalculate \"most semantic subcharacter paths\" for each character. Finally,\nadding the information contained in these paths to unigrams we claim to\nincrease the efficiency of text mining methods. We evaluate our method on a\ntext classification task on two corpora (Chinese and Japanese) of a total of 18\nmillion characters and get an improvement of 3% on an already high baseline of\n89.6% precision, obtained by a linear SVM classifier. Other possible\napplications and perspectives of the system are discussed.", "published": "2014-05-21 16:49:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5474v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
