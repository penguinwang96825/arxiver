{"title": "Bayesian CART models for aggregate claim modeling", "abstract": "This paper proposes three types of Bayesian CART (or BCART) models for\naggregate claim amount, namely, frequency-severity models, sequential models\nand joint models. We propose a general framework for the BCART models\napplicable to data with multivariate responses, which is particularly useful\nfor the joint BCART models with a bivariate response: the number of claims and\naggregate claim amount. To facilitate frequency-severity modeling, we\ninvestigate BCART models for the right-skewed and heavy-tailed claim severity\ndata by using various distributions. We discover that the Weibull distribution\nis superior to gamma and lognormal distributions, due to its ability to capture\ndifferent tail characteristics in tree models. Additionally, we find that\nsequential BCART models and joint BCART models, which incorporate dependence\nbetween the number of claims and average severity, are beneficial and thus\npreferable to the frequency-severity BCART models in which independence is\nassumed. The effectiveness of these models' performance is illustrated by\ncarefully designed simulations and real insurance data.", "published": "2024-09-03 13:58:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01908v1", "categories": ["stat.ME", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST", "stat.AP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "stat.ME"}
{"title": "Review of the EU ETS Literature: A Bibliometric Perspective", "abstract": "This study conducts a bibliometric review of scientific literature on the\nEuropean Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) from 2004 to 2024, using\nresearch articles from the Scopus database. Using the Bibliometrix R package,\nwe analyze publication trends, key themes, influential authors, and prominent\njournals related to the EU ETS. Our results indicate a notable increase in\nresearch activity over the past two decades, particularly during significant\npolicy changes and economic events affecting carbon markets. Key research\nfocuses include carbon pricing, market volatility, and economic impacts,\nhighlighting a shift toward financial analysis and policy implications.\nThematic mapping shows cap-and-trade systems, and carbon leakage as central\ntopics linking various research areas. Additionally, we observe key areas where\nfurther research could be beneficial, such as expanding non-parametric\nmethodologies, deepening the exploration of macroeconomic factors, and\nenhancing the examination of financial market connections. Moreover, we\nhighlight recent and innovative papers that contribute new insights, showcasing\nemerging trends and cutting-edge approaches within the field. This review\nprovides insights for researchers and policymakers, highlighting the evolving\nlandscape of EU ETS research and its relevance to global climate strategies.", "published": "2024-09-03 09:30:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01739v3", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "91B76, 91B82, 91B44, 62P20, 91B84, 62-00", "H.3.7; H.2.8; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Logarithmic regret in the ergodic Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model", "abstract": "We analyse the regret arising from learning the price sensitivity parameter\n$\\kappa$ of liquidity takers in the ergodic version of the Avellaneda-Stoikov\nmarket making model. We show that a learning algorithm based on a regularised\nmaximum-likelihood estimator for the parameter achieves the regret upper bound\nof order $\\ln^2 T$ in expectation. To obtain the result we need two key\ningredients. The first are tight upper bounds on the derivative of the ergodic\nconstant in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with respect to\n$\\kappa$. The second is the learning rate of the maximum-likelihood estimator\nwhich is obtained from concentration inequalities for Bernoulli signals.\nNumerical experiment confirms the convergence and the robustness of the\nproposed algorithm.", "published": "2024-09-03 16:20:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02025v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.TR", "Primary 93E35, Secondary 93C40, 93C41, 93E20, 91G80"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
