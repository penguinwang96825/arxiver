{"title": "Classifier-Based Text Simplification for Improved Machine Translation", "abstract": "Machine Translation is one of the research fields of Computational\nLinguistics. The objective of many MT Researchers is to develop an MT System\nthat produce good quality and high accuracy output translations and which also\ncovers maximum language pairs. As internet and Globalization is increasing day\nby day, we need a way that improves the quality of translation. For this\nreason, we have developed a Classifier based Text Simplification Model for\nEnglish-Hindi Machine Translation Systems. We have used support vector machines\nand Na\\\"ive Bayes Classifier to develop this model. We have also evaluated the\nperformance of these classifiers.", "published": "2015-07-12 12:14:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03223v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
