{"title": "LSTM-ARIMA as a Hybrid Approach in Algorithmic Investment Strategies", "abstract": "This study focuses on building an algorithmic investment strategy employing a\nhybrid approach that combines LSTM and ARIMA models referred to as LSTM-ARIMA.\nThis unique algorithm uses LSTM to produce final predictions but boosts the\nresults of this RNN by adding the residuals obtained from ARIMA predictions\namong other inputs. The algorithm is tested across three equity indices (S&P\n500, FTSE 100, and CAC 40) using daily frequency data from January 2000 to\nAugust 2023. The testing architecture is based on the walk-forward procedure\nfor the hyperparameter tunning phase that uses Random Search and backtesting\nthe algorithms. The selection of the optimal model is determined based on\nadequately selected performance metrics focused on risk-adjusted return\nmeasures. We considered two strategies for each algorithm: Long-Only and\nLong-Short to present the situation of two various groups of investors with\ndifferent investment policy restrictions. For each strategy and equity index,\nwe compute the performance metrics and visualize the equity curve to identify\nthe best strategy with the highest modified information ratio. The findings\nconclude that the LSTM-ARIMA algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms\nacross all the equity indices which confirms the strong potential behind hybrid\nML-TS (machine learning - time series) models in searching for the optimal\nalgorithmic investment strategies.", "published": "2024-06-26 09:39:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18206v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
