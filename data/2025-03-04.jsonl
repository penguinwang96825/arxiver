{"title": "Bayesian Estimation of Corporate Default Spreads", "abstract": "Risk-averse investors often wish to exclude stocks from their portfolios that\nbear high credit risk, which is a measure of a firm's likelihood of bankruptcy.\nThis risk is commonly estimated by constructing signals from quarterly\naccounting items, such as debt and income volatility. While such information\nmay provide a rich description of a firm's credit risk, the low-frequency with\nwhich the data is released implies that investors may be operating with\noutdated information. In this paper we circumvent this problem by developing a\nhigh-frequency credit risk proxy via corporate default spreads which are\nestimated from daily bond price data. We accomplish this by adapting classic\nyield curve estimation methods to a corporate bond setting, leveraging advances\nin Bayesian estimation to ensure higher model stability when working with small\nsample data which also allows us to directly model the uncertainty of our\npredictions.", "published": "2025-03-04 20:34:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02991v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

Discontinuities occur when the\ndeterminant crosses the negative real axis. We characterize these crossings for\nthe joint Fourier-Laplace transform of the integrated variance and log-price.\nAdditionally, we derive a corrected formula for the Fourier-Laplace transform\nand develop efficient numerical techniques to detect and compute these\ncrossings. Applying our algorithms to Fourier-based pricing in the rough\nStein-Stein model, we achieve a significant increase in accuracy while\ndrastically reducing computational cost compared to existing methods.", "published": "2025-03-04 19:47:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02965v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.CP", "91G20, 45P05"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Beyond the Leland strategies", "abstract": "In the Black and Scholes model with proportional transaction costs, the\nLeland strategy allows to asymptotically super-replicate the European Call\noption as the number of revision dates converges to + infinity and the\ntransaction costs rate tends rapidly to 0. This method relies heavily on the\nexplicit expression of the delta-hedging strategy in the Black and Scholes\nmodel where the volatility is enlarged to compensate for the transaction costs.\nWe solve the same problem of super-hedging but for a general model with an\narbitrary fixed number of revision dates and arbitrary fixed transaction costs\nrates. Moreover, our approach does not need the existence of a risk-neutral\nprobability measure and is (almost) model free and easily implementable from\nreal data.", "published": "2025-03-04 09:03:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02419v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Numerical methods for two-dimensional G-heat equation", "abstract": "The G-expectation is a sublinear expectation. It is an important tool for\npricing financial products and managing risk thanks to its ability to deal with\nmodel uncertainty. The problem is how to efficiently quantify it since the\ncommonly used Monte Carlo method does not work. Fortunately, the expectation of\na G-normal random variable can be linked to the viscosity solution of a fully\nnonlinear G-heat equation. In this paper, we propose a novel numerical scheme\nfor the two-dimensional G-heat equation and pay more attention to the case that\nthere exists uncertainty on the correlationship, especially to the case that\nthe correlationship ranges from negative to positive. The scheme is monotonic,\nstable, and convergent. The numerical tests show that the scheme is highly\nefficient.", "published": "2025-03-04 08:35:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02395v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "VWAP Execution with Signature-Enhanced Transformers: A Multi-Asset Learning Approach", "abstract": "In this paper I propose a novel approach to Volume Weighted Average Price\n(VWAP) execution that addresses two key practical challenges: the need for\nasset-specific model training and the capture of complex temporal dependencies.\nBuilding upon my recent work in dynamic VWAP execution arXiv:2502.18177, I\ndemonstrate that a single neural network trained across multiple assets can\nachieve performance comparable to or better than traditional asset-specific\nmodels. The proposed architecture combines a transformer-based design inspired\nby arXiv:2406.02486 with path signatures for capturing geometric features of\nprice-volume trajectories, as in arXiv:2406.17890. The empirical analysis,\nconducted on hourly cryptocurrency trading data from 80 trading pairs, shows\nthat the globally-fitted model with signature features (GFT-Sig) achieves\nsuperior performance in both absolute and quadratic VWAP loss metrics compared\nto asset-specific approaches. Notably, these improvements persist for\nout-of-sample assets, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across\ndifferent market conditions. The results suggest that combining global\nparameter sharing with signature-based feature extraction provides a scalable\nand robust approach to VWAP execution, offering significant practical\nadvantages over traditional asset-specific implementations.", "published": "2025-03-04 14:50:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02680v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market", "abstract": "Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into\nthe long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both\nseparately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy\ngains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention\nhas been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the\nestimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap,\nwe introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a\nprice series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We\nassess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power\nmarkets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the\nwar in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated\nmodels, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\\% to 15\\%\nin terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\\% in terms of profits from\na realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.", "published": "2025-03-04 11:30:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "econ.EM", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "To Hedge or Not to Hedge: Optimal Strategies for Stochastic Trade Flow Management", "abstract": "This paper addresses the trade-off between internalisation and\nexternalisation in the management of stochastic trade flows. We consider agents\nwho must absorb flows and manage risk by deciding whether to warehouse it or\nhedge in the market, thereby incurring transaction costs and market impact.\nUnlike market makers, these agents cannot skew their quotes to attract\noffsetting flows and deter risk-increasing ones, leading to a fundamentally\ndifferent problem. Within the Almgren-Chriss framework, we derive\nalmost-closed-form solutions in the case of quadratic execution costs, while\nmore general cases require numerical methods. In particular, we discuss the\nchallenges posed by artificial boundary conditions when using classical\ngrid-based numerical PDE techniques and propose reinforcement learning methods\nas an alternative.", "published": "2025-03-04 11:03:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02496v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
