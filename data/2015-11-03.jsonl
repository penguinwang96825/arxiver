{"title": "Detecting Interrogative Utterances with Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore different neural network architectures that can\npredict if a speaker of a given utterance is asking a question or making a\nstatement. We com- pare the outcomes of regularization methods that are\npopularly used to train deep neural networks and study how different context\nfunctions can affect the classification performance. We also compare the\nefficacy of gated activation functions that are favorably used in recurrent\nneural networks and study how to combine multimodal inputs. We evaluate our\nmodels on two multimodal datasets: MSR-Skype and CALLHOME.", "published": "2015-11-03 19:26:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01042v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Distributed Deep Learning for Question Answering", "abstract": "This paper is an empirical study of the distributed deep learning for\nquestion answering subtasks: answer selection and question classification.\nComparison studies of SGD, MSGD, ADADELTA, ADAGRAD, ADAM/ADAMAX, RMSPROP,\nDOWNPOUR and EASGD/EAMSGD algorithms have been presented. Experimental results\nshow that the distributed framework based on the message passing interface can\naccelerate the convergence speed at a sublinear scale. This paper demonstrates\nthe importance of distributed training. For example, with 48 workers, a 24x\nspeedup is achievable for the answer selection task and running time is\ndecreased from 138.2 hours to 5.81 hours, which will increase the productivity\nsignificantly.", "published": "2015-11-03 23:18:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01158v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.DC"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
