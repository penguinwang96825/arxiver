{"title": "The \"handedness\" of language: Directional symmetry breaking of sign\n  usage in words", "abstract": "Language, which allows complex ideas to be communicated through symbolic\nsequences, is a characteristic feature of our species and manifested in a\nmultitude of forms. Using large written corpora for many different languages\nand scripts, we show that the occurrence probability distributions of signs at\nthe left and right ends of words have a distinct heterogeneous nature.\nCharacterizing this asymmetry using quantitative inequality measures, viz.\ninformation entropy and the Gini index, we show that the beginning of a word is\nless restrictive in sign usage than the end. This property is not simply\nattributable to the use of common affixes as it is seen even when only word\nroots are considered. We use the existence of this asymmetry to infer the\ndirection of writing in undeciphered inscriptions that agrees with the\narchaeological evidence. Unlike traditional investigations of phonotactic\nconstraints which focus on language-specific patterns, our study reveals a\nproperty valid across languages and writing systems. As both language and\nwriting are unique aspects of our species, this universal signature may reflect\nan innate feature of the human cognitive phenomenon.", "published": "2015-09-30 10:59:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09121v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Enhanced Bilingual Evaluation Understudy", "abstract": "Our research extends the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) evaluation\ntechnique for statistical machine translation to make it more adjustable and\nrobust. We intend to adapt it to resemble human evaluation more. We perform\nexperiments to evaluate the performance of our technique against the primary\nexisting evaluation methods. We describe and show the improvements it makes\nover existing methods as well as correlation to them. When human translators\ntranslate a text, they often use synonyms, different word orders or style, and\nother similar variations. We propose an SMT evaluation technique that enhances\nthe BLEU metric to consider variations such as those.", "published": "2015-09-30 09:13:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09088v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Real-Time Statistical Speech Translation", "abstract": "This research investigates the Statistical Machine Translation approaches to\ntranslate speech in real time automatically. Such systems can be used in a\npipeline with speech recognition and synthesis software in order to produce a\nreal-time voice communication system between foreigners. We obtained three main\ndata sets from spoken proceedings that represent three different types of human\nspeech. TED, Europarl, and OPUS parallel text corpora were used as the basis\nfor training of language models, for developmental tuning and testing of the\ntranslation system. We also conducted experiments involving part of speech\ntagging, compound splitting, linear language model interpolation, TrueCasing\nand morphosyntactic analysis.

{"title": "A Sentence Meaning Based Alignment Method for Parallel Text Corpora\n  Preparation", "abstract": "Text alignment is crucial to the accuracy of Machine Translation (MT)\nsystems, some NLP tools or any other text processing tasks requiring bilingual\ndata. This research proposes a language independent sentence alignment approach\nbased on Polish (not position-sensitive language) to English experiments. This\nalignment approach was developed on the TED Talks corpus, but can be used for\nany text domain or language pair. The proposed approach implements various\nheuristics for sentence recognition. Some of them value synonyms and semantic\ntext structure analysis as a part of additional information. Minimization of\ndata loss was ensured. The solution is compared to other sentence alignment\nimplementations. Also an improvement in MT system score with text processed\nwith described tool is shown.", "published": "2015-09-30 09:29:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09093v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
