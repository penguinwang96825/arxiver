{"title": "Speech: A Challenge to Digital Signal Processing Technology for\n  Human-to-Computer Interaction", "abstract": "This software project based paper is for a vision of the near future in which\ncomputer interaction is characterized by natural face-to-face conversations\nwith lifelike characters that speak, emote, and gesture. The first step is\nspeech. The dream of a true virtual reality, a complete human-computer\ninteraction system will not come true unless we try to give some perception to\nmachine and make it perceive the outside world as humans communicate with each\nother. This software project is under development for listening and replying\nmachine (Computer) through speech. The Speech interface is developed to convert\nspeech input into some parametric form (Speech-to-Text) for further processing\nand the results, text output to speech synthesis (Text-to-Speech)", "published": "2013-05-08 05:55:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1925v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
