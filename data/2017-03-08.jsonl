{"title": "A World of Difference: Divergent Word Interpretations among People", "abstract": "Divergent word usages reflect differences among people. In this paper, we\npresent a novel angle for studying word usage divergence -- word\ninterpretations. We propose an approach that quantifies semantic differences in\ninterpretations among different groups of people. The effectiveness of our\napproach is validated by quantitative evaluations. Experiment results indicate\nthat divergences in word interpretations exist. We further apply the approach\nto two well studied types of differences between people -- gender and region.\nThe detected words with divergent interpretations reveal the unique features of\nspecific groups of people. For gender, we discover that certain different\ninterests, social attitudes, and characters between males and females are\nreflected in their divergent interpretations of many words. For region, we find\nthat specific interpretations of certain words reveal the geographical and\ncultural features of different regions.", "published": "2017-03-08 14:51:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02859v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Spice up Your Chat: The Intentions and Sentiment Effects of Using Emoji", "abstract": "Emojis, as a new way of conveying nonverbal cues, are widely adopted in\ncomputer-mediated communications. In this paper, first from a message sender\nperspective, we focus on people's motives in using four types of emojis --\npositive, neutral, negative, and non-facial. We compare the willingness levels\nof using these emoji types for seven typical intentions that people usually\napply nonverbal cues for in communication. The results of extensive statistical\nhypothesis tests not only report the popularities of the intentions, but also\nuncover the subtle differences between emoji types in terms of intended uses.\nSecond, from a perspective of message recipients, we further study the\nsentiment effects of emojis, as well as their duplications, on verbal messages.\nDifferent from previous studies in emoji sentiment, we study the sentiments of\nemojis and their contexts as a whole. The experiment results indicate that the\npowers of conveying sentiment are different between four emoji types, and the\nsentiment effects of emojis vary in the contexts of different valences.", "published": "2017-03-08 14:57:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02860v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Introduction to Formal Concept Analysis and Its Applications in\n  Information Retrieval and Related Fields", "abstract": "This paper is a tutorial on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and its\napplications. FCA is an applied branch of Lattice Theory, a mathematical\ndiscipline which enables formalisation of concepts as basic units of human\nthinking and analysing data in the object-attribute form. Originated in early\n80s, during the last three decades, it became a popular human-centred tool for\nknowledge representation and data analysis with numerous applications. Since\nthe tutorial was specially prepared for RuSSIR 2014, the covered FCA topics\ninclude Information Retrieval with a focus on visualisation aspects, Machine\nLearning, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Text Mining and several others.", "published": "2017-03-08 12:53:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02819v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.DM", "stat.ML", "68P20, 06B99, 68T30", "H.3.3; G.2; I.2"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
