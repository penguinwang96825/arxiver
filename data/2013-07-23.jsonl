{"title": "Human and Automatic Evaluation of English-Hindi Machine Translation", "abstract": "For the past 60 years, Research in machine translation is going on. For the\ndevelopment in this field, a lot of new techniques are being developed each\nday. As a result, we have witnessed development of many automatic machine\ntranslators. A manager of machine translation development project needs to know\nthe performance increase/decrease, after changes have been done in his system.\nDue to this reason, a need for evaluation of machine translation systems was\nfelt. In this article, we shall present the evaluation of some machine\ntranslators. This evaluation will be done by a human evaluator and by some\nautomatic evaluation metrics, which will be done at sentence, document and\nsystem level. In the end we shall also discuss the comparison between the\nevaluations.", "published": "2013-07-23 17:15:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6163v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
