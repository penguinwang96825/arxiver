{"title": "A new approach for generation of generalized basic probability assignment in the evidence theory", "abstract": "The process of information fusion needs to deal with a large number of uncertain information with multi-source, heterogeneity, inaccuracy, unreliability, and incompleteness. In practical engineering applications, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is widely used in multi-source information fusion owing to its effectiveness in data fusion. Information sources have an important impact on multi-source information fusion in an environment of complex, unstable, uncertain, and incomplete characteristics. To address multi-source information fusion problem, this paper considers the situation of uncertain information modeling from the closed world to the open world assumption and studies the generation of basic probability assignment (BPA) with incomplete information. In this paper, a new method is proposed to generate generalized basic probability assignment (GBPA) based on the triangular fuzzy number model under the open world assumption. The proposed method can not only be used in different complex environments simply and flexibly, but also have less information loss in information processing. Finally, a series of comprehensive experiments basing on the UCI data sets are used to verify the rationality and superiority of the proposed method.", "published": "2020-04-06 15:40:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02746v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Ontologies in CLARIAH: Towards Interoperability in History, Language and Media", "abstract": "One of the most important goals of digital humanities is to provide researchers with data and tools for new research questions, either by increasing the scale of scholarly studies, linking existing databases, or improving the accessibility of data. Here, the FAIR principles provide a useful framework as these state that data needs to be: Findable, as they are often scattered among various sources; Accessible, since some might be offline or behind paywalls; Interoperable, thus using standard knowledge representation formats and shared vocabularies; and Reusable, through adequate licensing and permissions. Integrating data from diverse humanities domains is not trivial, research questions such as \"was economic wealth equally distributed in the 18th century?\", or \"what are narratives constructed around disruptive media events?\") and preparation phases (e.g. data collection, knowledge organisation, cleaning) of scholars need to be taken into account. In this chapter, we describe the ontologies and tools developed and integrated in the Dutch national project CLARIAH to address these issues across datasets from three fundamental domains or \"pillars\" of the humanities (linguistics, social and economic history, and media studies) that have paradigmatic data representations (textual corpora, structured data, and multimedia). We summarise the lessons learnt from using such ontologies and tools in these domains from a generalisation and reusability perspective.", "published": "2020-04-06 17:38:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02845v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CY", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "A Comprehensive Study of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Generalized Fading", "abstract": "Leveraging on the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm for enabling the next Internet of Things (IoT) and 6G era, this paper develops a comprehensive theoretical framework characterizing the performance of RIS-assisted communications in a plethora of propagation environments. We derive unified mathematical models for the outage probability and ergodic capacity of single and multiple-element RIS over Fox's H fading channel, which includes as special cases nearly all linear and non linear multi-path and shadowing fading models adopted in the open literature. For gleaning further insights, we capitalize on the algebraic asymptotic expansions of the H-transform to further analyze the outage probability and capacity at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a unified fashion. Asymptotic analysis shows two scaling rates of the outage probability at large average SNR. Moreover, by harnessing its tractability, the developed statistical machinery is employed to characterize the performance of multiple randomly distributed RIS-assisted communications over Fox's H fading channels. We show that there is a great potential to improve the outage performance and thereby the capacity when fewer RISs are deployed each with more reflecting elements.", "published": "2020-04-06 18:19:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02922v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
