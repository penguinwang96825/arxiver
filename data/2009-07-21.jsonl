{"title": "The interval constrained 3-coloring problem", "abstract": "In this paper, we settle the open complexity status of interval constrained coloring with a fixed number of colors. We prove that the problem is already NP-complete if the number of different colors is 3. Previously, it has only been known that it is NP-complete, if the number of colors is part of the input and that the problem is solvable in polynomial time, if the number of colors is at most 2. We also show that it is hard to satisfy almost all of the constraints for a feasible instance.", "published": "2009-07-21 07:39:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3563v2", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
