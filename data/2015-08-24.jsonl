{"title": "A Framework for Comparing Groups of Documents", "abstract": "We present a general framework for comparing multiple groups of documents. A\nbipartite graph model is proposed where document groups are represented as one\nnode set and the comparison criteria are represented as the other node set.\nUsing this model, we present basic algorithms to extract insights into\nsimilarities and differences among the document groups. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe versatility of our framework through an analysis of NSF funding programs\nfor basic research.", "published": "2015-08-24 18:14:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05902v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Echoes of Persuasion: The Effect of Euphony in Persuasive Communication", "abstract": "While the effect of various lexical, syntactic, semantic and stylistic\nfeatures have been addressed in persuasive language from a computational point\nof view, the persuasive effect of phonetics has received little attention. By\nmodeling a notion of euphony and analyzing four datasets comprising persuasive\nand non-persuasive sentences in different domains (political speeches, movie\nquotes, slogans and tweets), we explore the impact of sounds on different forms\nof persuasiveness. We conduct a series of analyses and prediction experiments\nwithin and across datasets. Our results highlight the positive role of phonetic\ndevices on persuasion.", "published": "2015-08-24 14:15:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05817v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
