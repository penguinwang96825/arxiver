{"title": "On measuring linguistic intelligence", "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of measuring how many languages a person\n\"effectively\" speaks given that some of the languages are close to each other.\nIn other words, to assign a meaningful number to her language portfolio.\nIntuition says that someone who speaks fluently Spanish and Portuguese is\nlinguistically less proficient compared to someone who speaks fluently Spanish\nand Chinese since it takes more effort for a native Spanish speaker to learn\nChinese than Portuguese. As the number of languages grows and their proficiency\nlevels vary, it gets even more complicated to assign a score to a language\nportfolio. In this article we propose such a measure (\"linguistic quotient\" -\nLQ) that can account for these effects.\n  We define the properties that such a measure should have. They are based on\nthe idea of coherent risk measures from the mathematical finance. Having laid\ndown the foundation, we propose one such a measure together with the algorithm\nthat works on languages classification tree as input.\n  The algorithm together with the input is available online at lingvometer.com", "published": "2015-03-20 16:41:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06151v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
