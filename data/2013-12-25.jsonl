{"title": "Formal Ontology Learning on Factual IS-A Corpus in English using\n  Description Logics", "abstract": "Ontology Learning (OL) is the computational task of generating a knowledge\nbase in the form of an ontology given an unstructured corpus whose content is\nin natural language (NL). Several works can be found in this area most of which\nare limited to statistical and lexico-syntactic pattern matching based\ntechniques Light-Weight OL. These techniques do not lead to very accurate\nlearning mostly because of several linguistic nuances in NL. Formal OL is an\nalternative (less explored) methodology were deep linguistics analysis is made\nusing theory and tools found in computational linguistics to generate formal\naxioms and definitions instead simply inducing a taxonomy. In this paper we\npropose \"Description Logic (DL)\" based formal OL framework for learning factual\nIS-A type sentences in English. We claim that semantic construction of IS-A\nsentences is non trivial. Hence, we also claim that such sentences requires\nspecial studies in the context of OL before any truly formal OL can be\nproposed. We introduce a learner tool, called DLOL_IS-A, that generated such\nontologies in the owl format. We have adopted \"Gold Standard\" based OL\nevaluation on IS-A rich WCL v.1.1 dataset and our own Community representative\nIS-A dataset. We observed significant improvement of DLOL_IS-A when compared to\nthe light-weight OL tool Text2Onto and formal OL tool FRED.", "published": "2013-12-25 09:17:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6947v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Description Logics based Formalization of Wh-Queries", "abstract": "The problem of Natural Language Query Formalization (NLQF) is to translate a\ngiven user query in natural language (NL) into a formal language so that the\nsemantic interpretation has equivalence with the NL interpretation.\nFormalization of NL queries enables logic based reasoning during information\nretrieval, database query, question-answering, etc. Formalization also helps in\nWeb query normalization and indexing, query intent analysis, etc. In this paper\nwe are proposing a Description Logics based formal methodology for wh-query\nintent (also called desire) identification and corresponding formal\ntranslation.

{"title": "Subjectivity Classification using Machine Learning Techniques for Mining\n  Feature-Opinion Pairs from Web Opinion Sources", "abstract": "Due to flourish of the Web 2.0, web opinion sources are rapidly emerging\ncontaining precious information useful for both customers and manufactures.\nRecently, feature based opinion mining techniques are gaining momentum in which\ncustomer reviews are processed automatically for mining product features and\nuser opinions expressed over them. However, customer reviews may contain both\nopinionated and factual sentences. Distillations of factual contents improve\nmining performance by preventing noisy and irrelevant extraction. In this\npaper, combination of both supervised machine learning and rule-based\napproaches are proposed for mining feasible feature-opinion pairs from\nsubjective review sentences. In the first phase of the proposed approach, a\nsupervised machine learning technique is applied for classifying subjective and\nobjective sentences from customer reviews. In the next phase, a rule based\nmethod is implemented which applies linguistic and semantic analysis of texts\nto mine feasible feature-opinion pairs from subjective sentences retained after\nthe first phase. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is established\nthrough experimentation over customer reviews on different electronic products.", "published": "2013-12-25 12:38:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6962v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
