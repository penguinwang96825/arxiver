{"title": "Sign Language Lexical Recognition With Propositional Dynamic Logic", "abstract": "This paper explores the use of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) as a\nsuitable formal framework for describing Sign Language (SL), the language of\ndeaf people, in the context of natural language processing. SLs are visual,\ncomplete, standalone languages which are just as expressive as oral languages.\nSigns in SL usually correspond to sequences of highly specific body postures\ninterleaved with movements, which make reference to real world objects,\ncharacters or situations. Here we propose a formal representation of SL signs,\nthat will help us with the analysis of automatically-collected hand tracking\ndata from French Sign Language (FSL) video corpora. We further show how such a\nrepresentation could help us with the design of computer aided SL verification\ntools, which in turn would bring us closer to the development of an automatic\nrecognition system for these languages.", "published": "2014-03-26 11:47:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6636v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
