{"title": "Robust Bernoulli mixture models for credit portfolio risk", "abstract": "This paper presents comparison results and establishes risk bounds for credit\nportfolios within classes of Bernoulli mixture models, assuming conditionally\nindependent defaults that are stochastically increasing with a common risk\nfactor. We provide simple and interpretable conditions for conditional default\nprobabilities that imply a comparison of credit portfolio losses in convex\norder. In the case of threshold models, the ranking of portfolio losses is\nbased on a pointwise comparison of the underlying copulas. Our setting includes\nas special case the well-known Gaussian copula model but allows for general\ntail dependencies, which are crucial for modeling credit portfolio risks.\nMoreover, our results extend the classical parameterized models, such as the\nindustry models CreditMetrics and KMV Portfolio Manager, to a robust setting\nwhere individual parameters or the copula modeling the dependence structure can\nbe ambiguous. A simulation study and a real data example under model\nuncertainty offer evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.", "published": "2024-11-18 12:31:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11522v1", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.MF", "62P05, 91Gxx"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "Multidimensional specific relative entropy between continuous martingales", "abstract": "In continuous time, the laws of martingales tend to be singular to each\nother. Notably, N. Gantert introduced the concept of specific relative entropy\nbetween real-valued continuous martingales, defined as a scaling limit of\nfinite-dimensional relative entropies, and showed that this quantity is\nnon-trivial despite the aforementioned mutual singularity of martingale laws.\n  Our main mathematical contribution is to extend this object, originally\nrestricted to one-dimensional martingales, to multiple dimensions. Among other\nresults, we establish that Gantert's inequality, bounding the specific relative\nentropy with respect to Wiener measure from below by an explicit functional of\nthe quadratic variation, essentially carries over to higher dimensions. We also\nprove that this lower bound is tight, in the sense that it is the convex lower\nsemicontinuous envelope of the specific relative entropy. This is a novel\nresult even in dimension one. Finally we establish closed-form expressions for\nthe specific relative entropy in simple multidimensional examples.", "published": "2024-11-18 09:30:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11408v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
{"title": "High resolution microprice estimates from limit orderbook data using hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin Machines", "abstract": "We propose an error-correcting model for the microprice, a high-frequency\nestimator of future prices given higher order information of imbalances in the\norderbook. The model takes into account a current microprice estimate given the\nspread and best bid to ask imbalance, and adjusts the microprice based on\nrecent dynamics of higher price rank imbalances. We introduce a computationally\nfast estimator using a recently proposed hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin\nmachine framework and demonstrate empirically that this estimator can provide a\nrobust estimate of future prices in the orderbook.", "published": "2024-11-18 13:18:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13594v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Advance Detection Of Bull And Bear Phases In Cryptocurrency Markets", "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile financial instruments with more and more\nnew retail investors joining the scene with each passing day. Bitcoin has\nalways proved to determine in which way the rest of the cryptocurrency market\nis headed towards. As of today Bitcoin has a market dominance of close to 50\npercent.
