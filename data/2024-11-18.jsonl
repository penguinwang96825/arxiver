{"title": "High resolution microprice estimates from limit orderbook data using hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin Machines", "abstract": "We propose an error-correcting model for the microprice, a high-frequency\nestimator of future prices given higher order information of imbalances in the\norderbook. The model takes into account a current microprice estimate given the\nspread and best bid to ask imbalance, and adjusts the microprice based on\nrecent dynamics of higher price rank imbalances. We introduce a computationally\nfast estimator using a recently proposed hyperdimensional vector Tsetlin\nmachine framework and demonstrate empirically that this estimator can provide a\nrobust estimate of future prices in the orderbook.", "published": "2024-11-18 13:18:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13594v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
