{"title": "Statistical Parsing by Machine Learning from a Classical Arabic Treebank", "abstract": "Research into statistical parsing for English has enjoyed over a decade of\nsuccessful results. However, adapting these models to other languages has met\nwith difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is\none of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free\nword order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied\nin computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language\nof the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant\ncontributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic.\n  A central argument of this thesis is that using a hybrid representation\nclosely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To\ntest this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure\ndependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an\n87.47% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an\nF1-score of 89.03%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is\nbetter suited to Classical Arabic.", "published": "2015-10-25 00:53:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07193v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
