{"title": "Realized Volatility Forecasting for New Issues and Spin-Offs using Multi-Source Transfer Learning", "abstract": "Forecasting the volatility of financial assets is essential for various\nfinancial applications. This paper addresses the challenging task of\nforecasting the volatility of financial assets with limited historical data,\nsuch as new issues or spin-offs, by proposing a multi-source transfer learning\napproach. Specifically, we exploit complementary source data of assets with a\nsubstantial historical data record by selecting source time series instances\nthat are most similar to the limited target data of the new issue/spin-off.\nBased on these instances and the target data, we estimate linear and non-linear\nrealized volatility models and compare their forecasting performance to\nforecasts of models trained exclusively on the target data, and models trained\non the entire source and target data. The results show that our transfer\nlearning approach outperforms the alternative models and that the integration\nof complementary data is also beneficial immediately after the initial trading\nday of the new issue/spin-off.", "published": "2025-03-16 20:56:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12648v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "Intraday Battery Dispatch for Hybrid Renewable Energy Assets", "abstract": "We develop a mathematical model for intraday dispatch of co-located\nwind-battery energy assets. Focusing on the primary objective of firming\ngrid-side actual production vis-a-vis the preset day-ahead hourly generation\ntargets, we conduct a comprehensive study of the resulting stochastic control\nproblem across different firming formulations and wind generation dynamics.\nAmong others, we provide a closed-form solution in the special case of a\nquadratic objective and linear dynamics, as well as design a novel adaptation\nof a Gaussian Process-based Regression Monte Carlo algorithm for our setting.\nExtensions studied include an asymmetric loss function for peak shaving,\ncapturing the cost of battery cycling, and the role of battery duration. In the\napplied portion of our work, we calibrate our model to a collection of 140+\nwind-battery assets in Texas, benchmarking the economic benefits of firming\nbased on outputs of a realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch solver.", "published": "2025-03-16 00:32:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12305v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "What Can 240,000 New Credit Transactions Tell Us About the Impact of NGEU Funds?", "abstract": "Using a panel data local projections model and controlling for firm\ncharacteristics, procurement bid attributes, and macroeconomic conditions, the\nstudy estimates the dynamic effects of procurement awards on new lending, a\nmore precise measure than the change in the stock of credit. The analysis\nfurther examines heterogeneity in credit responses based on firm size,\nindustry, credit maturity, and value chain position of the firms. The empirical\nevidence confirms that public procurement awards significantly increase new\nlending, with NGEU-funded contracts generating stronger credit expansion than\ntraditional procurement during the recent period. The results show that the\nimpact of NGEU procurement programs aligns closely with historical procurement\nimpacts, with differences driven mainly by lower utilization rates. Moreover,\nintegrating high-frequency financial data with procurement records highlights\nthe potential of Big Data in refining public policy design.", "published": "2025-03-16 19:50:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01964v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
