{"title": "EX-DRL: Hedging Against Heavy Losses with EXtreme Distributional Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Recent advancements in Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for\nmodeling loss distributions have shown promise in developing hedging strategies\nin derivatives markets. A common approach in DRL involves learning the\nquantiles of loss distributions at specified levels using Quantile Regression\n(QR). This method is particularly effective in option hedging due to its direct\nquantile-based risk assessment, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional\nValue at Risk (CVaR). However, these risk measures depend on the accurate\nestimation of extreme quantiles in the loss distribution's tail, which can be\nimprecise in QR-based DRL due to the rarity and extremity of tail data, as\nhighlighted in the literature. To address this issue, we propose EXtreme DRL\n(EX-DRL), which enhances extreme quantile prediction by modeling the tail of\nthe loss distribution with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). This method\nintroduces supplementary data to mitigate the scarcity of extreme quantile\nobservations, thereby improving estimation accuracy through QR. Comprehensive\nexperiments on gamma hedging options demonstrate that EX-DRL improves existing\nQR-based models by providing more precise estimates of extreme quantiles,\nthereby improving the computation and reliability of risk metrics for complex\nfinancial risk management.", "published": "2024-08-22 14:41:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12446v2", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "Optimizing Performance: How Compact Models Match or Exceed GPT's Classification Capabilities through Fine-Tuning", "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate that non-generative, small-sized models such as\nFinBERT and FinDRoBERTa, when fine-tuned, can outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\nmodels in zero-shot learning settings in sentiment analysis for financial news.\nThese fine-tuned models show comparable results to GPT-3.5 when it is\nfine-tuned on the task of determining market sentiment from daily financial\nnews summaries sourced from Bloomberg. To fine-tune and compare these models,\nwe created a novel database, which assigns a market score to each piece of news\nwithout human interpretation bias, systematically identifying the mentioned\ncompanies and analyzing whether their stocks have gone up, down, or remained\nneutral. Furthermore, the paper shows that the assumptions of Condorcet's Jury\nTheorem do not hold suggesting that fine-tuned small models are not independent\nof the fine-tuned GPT models, indicating behavioural similarities. Lastly, the\nresulted fine-tuned models are made publicly available on HuggingFace,\nproviding a resource for further research in financial sentiment analysis and\ntext classification.", "published": "2024-08-22 09:10:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11408v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Enhancing Causal Discovery in Financial Networks with Piecewise Quantile Regression", "abstract": "Financial networks can be constructed using statistical dependencies found\nwithin the price series of speculative assets. Across the various methods used\nto infer these networks, there is a general reliance on predictive modelling to\ncapture cross-correlation effects. These methods usually model the flow of\nmean-response information, or the propagation of volatility and risk within the\nmarket. Such techniques, though insightful, don't fully capture the broader\ndistribution-level causality that is possible within speculative markets. This\npaper introduces a novel approach, combining quantile regression with a\npiecewise linear embedding scheme - allowing us to construct causality networks\nthat identify the complex tail interactions inherent to financial markets.\nApplying this method to 260 cryptocurrency return series, we uncover\nsignificant tail-tail causal effects and substantial causal asymmetry. We\nidentify a propensity for coins to be self-influencing, with comparatively\nsparse cross variable effects. Assessing all link types in conjunction, Bitcoin\nstands out as the primary influencer - a nuance that is missed in conventional\nlinear mean-response analyses. Our findings introduce a comprehensive framework\nfor modelling distributional causality, paving the way towards more holistic\nrepresentations of causality in financial markets.", "published": "2024-08-22 08:39:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12210v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "econ.EM", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
