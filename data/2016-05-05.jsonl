{"title": "Stance and Sentiment in Tweets", "abstract": "We can often detect from a person's utterances whether he/she is in favor of\nor against a given target entity -- their stance towards the target. However, a\nperson may express the same stance towards a target by using negative or\npositive language. Here for the first time we present a dataset of\ntweet--target pairs annotated for both stance and sentiment. The targets may or\nmay not be referred to in the tweets, and they may or may not be the target of\nopinion in the tweets. Partitions of this dataset were used as training and\ntest sets in a SemEval-2016 shared task competition. We propose a simple stance\ndetection system that outperforms submissions from all 19 teams that\nparticipated in the shared task. Additionally, access to both stance and\nsentiment annotations allows us to explore several research questions. We show\nthat while knowing the sentiment expressed by a tweet is beneficial for stance\nclassification, it alone is not sufficient. Finally, we use additional\nunlabeled data through distant supervision techniques and word embeddings to\nfurther improve stance classification.", "published": "2016-05-05 17:07:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01655v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Improving Automated Patent Claim Parsing: Dataset, System, and\n  Experiments", "abstract": "Off-the-shelf natural language processing software performs poorly when\nparsing patent claims owing to their use of irregular language relative to the\ncorpora built from news articles and the web typically utilized to train this\nsoftware. Stopping short of the extensive and expensive process of accumulating\na large enough dataset to completely retrain parsers for patent claims, a\nmethod of adapting existing natural language processing software towards patent\nclaims via forced part of speech tag correction is proposed. An Amazon\nMechanical Turk collection campaign organized to generate a public corpus to\ntrain such an improved claim parsing system is discussed, identifying lessons\nlearned during the campaign that can be of use in future NLP dataset collection\ncampaigns with AMT. Experiments utilizing this corpus and other patent claim\nsets measure the parsing performance improvement garnered via the claim parsing\nsystem. Finally, the utility of the improved claim parsing system within other\npatent processing applications is demonstrated via experiments showing improved\nautomated patent subject classification when the new claim parsing system is\nutilized to generate the features.", "published": "2016-05-05 20:11:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01744v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "LSTM-based Mixture-of-Experts for Knowledge-Aware Dialogues", "abstract": "We introduce an LSTM-based method for dynamically integrating several\nword-prediction experts to obtain a conditional language model which can be\ngood simultaneously at several subtasks. We illustrate this general approach\nwith an application to dialogue where we integrate a neural chat model, good at\nconversational aspects, with a neural question-answering model, good at\nretrieving precise information from a knowledge-base, and show how the\nintegration combines the strengths of the independent components.

{"title": "Modeling Rich Contexts for Sentiment Classification with LSTM", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis on social media data such as tweets and weibo has become a\nvery important and challenging task. Due to the intrinsic properties of such\ndata, tweets are short, noisy, and of divergent topics, and sentiment\nclassification on these data requires to modeling various contexts such as the\nretweet/reply history of a tweet, and the social context about authors and\nrelationships. While few prior study has approached the issue of modeling\ncontexts in tweet, this paper proposes to use a hierarchical LSTM to model rich\ncontexts in tweet, particularly long-range context.

{"title": "The IBM Speaker Recognition System: Recent Advances and Error Analysis", "abstract": "We present the recent advances along with an error analysis of the IBM\nspeaker recognition system for conversational speech. Some of the key\nadvancements that contribute to our system include: a nearest-neighbor\ndiscriminant analysis (NDA) approach (as opposed to LDA) for intersession\nvariability compensation in the i-vector space, the application of speaker and\nchannel-adapted features derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystem for speaker recognition, and the use of a DNN acoustic model with a very\nlarge number of output units (~10k senones) to compute the frame-level soft\nalignments required in the i-vector estimation process. We evaluate these\ntechniques on the NIST 2010 SRE extended core conditions (C1-C9), as well as\nthe 10sec-10sec condition. To our knowledge, results achieved by our system\nrepresent the best performances published to date on these conditions. For\nexample, on the extended tel-tel condition (C5) the system achieves an EER of\n0.59%. To garner further understanding of the remaining errors (on C5), we\nexamine the recordings associated with the low scoring target trials, where\nvarious issues are identified for the problematic recordings/trials.\nInterestingly, it is observed that correcting the pathological recordings not\nonly improves the scores for the target trials but also for the nontarget\ntrials.", "published": "2016-05-05 15:57:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01635v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
