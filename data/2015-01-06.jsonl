{"title": "Unknown Words Analysis in POS tagging of Sinhala Language", "abstract": "Part of Speech (POS) is a very vital topic in Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) task in any language, which involves analysing the construction of the\nlanguage, behaviours and the dynamics of the language, the knowledge that could\nbe utilized in computational linguistics analysis and automation applications.\nIn this context, dealing with unknown words (words do not appear in the lexicon\nreferred as unknown words) is also an important task, since growing NLP systems\nare used in more and more new applications. One aid of predicting lexical\ncategories of unknown words is the use of syntactical knowledge of the\nlanguage. The distinction between open class words and closed class words\ntogether with syntactical features of the language used in this research to\npredict lexical categories of unknown words in the tagging process. An\nexperiment is performed to investigate the ability of the approach to parse\nunknown words using syntactical knowledge without human intervention. This\nexperiment shows that the performance of the tagging process is enhanced when\nword class distinction is used together with syntactic rules to parse sentences\ncontaining unknown words in Sinhala language.", "published": "2015-01-06 18:03:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01254v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

It combines an optimization of preference criteria of\nvisitors with an automatic extraction of artwork importance from museum\ninformation based on Natural Language Processing using textual energy. This\nproject includes researchers from computer and social sciences. Some results\nare obtained with numerical experiments. They show that our model clearly\nimproves the satisfaction of the visitor who follows the proposed tour. This\nwork foreshadows some interesting outcomes and applications about on-demand\npersonalized visit of museums in a very near future.", "published": "2015-01-06 17:58:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01252v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Arabic Text Categorization Algorithm using Vector Evaluation Method", "abstract": "Text categorization is the process of grouping documents into categories\nbased on their contents. This process is important to make information\nretrieval easier, and it became more important due to the huge textual\ninformation available online. The main problem in text categorization is how to\nimprove the classification accuracy. Although Arabic text categorization is a\nnew promising field, there are a few researches in this field. This paper\nproposes a new method for Arabic text categorization using vector evaluation.\nThe proposed method uses a categorized Arabic documents corpus, and then the\nweights of the tested document's words are calculated to determine the document\nkeywords which will be compared with the keywords of the corpus categorizes to\ndetermine the tested document's best category.", "published": "2015-01-06 21:10:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01318v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
