{"title": "Semantics and pragmatics in actual software applications and in web\n  search engines: exploring innovations", "abstract": "While new ways to use the Semantic Web are developed every week, which allow\nthe user to find information on web more accurately - for example in search\nengines - some sophisticated pragmatic tools are becoming more important - for\nexample in web interfaces known as Social Intelligence, or in the most famous\nSiri by Apple. The work aims to analyze whether and where we can identify the\nboundary between semantics and pragmatics in the software used by analyzed\nsystems. examining how the linguistic disciplines are fundamental in their\nprogress. Is it possible to assume that the tools of social intelligence have a\npragmatic approach to the questions of the user, or it is just a use of a very\nrich vocabulary, with the use of semantic tools?", "published": "2013-06-29 10:40:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0087v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
