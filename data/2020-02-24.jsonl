{"title": "iLQGames.jl: Rapidly Designing and Solving Differential Games in Julia", "abstract": "In many problems that involve multiple decision making agents, optimal choices for each agent depend on the choices of others. Differential game theory provides a principled formalism for expressing these coupled interactions and recent work offers efficient approximations to solve these problems to non-cooperative equilibria. iLQGames.jl is a framework for designing and solving differential games, built around the iterative linear-quadratic method. It is written in the Julia programming language to allow flexible prototyping and integration with other research software, while leveraging the high-performance nature of the language to allow real-time execution. The open-source software package can be found at https://github.com/lassepe/iLQGames.jl.", "published": "2020-02-24 12:01:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10185v2", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "The role of adaptivity in a numerical method for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model", "abstract": "We demonstrate the effectiveness of an adaptive explicit Euler method for the approximate solution of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. This relies on a class of path-bounded timestepping strategies which work by reducing the stepsize as solutions approach a neighbourhood of zero. The method is hybrid in the sense that a convergent backstop method is invoked if the timestep becomes too small, or to prevent solutions from overshooting zero and becoming negative. Under parameter constraints that imply Feller's condition, we prove that such a scheme is strongly convergent, of order at least 1/2. Control of the strong error is important for multi-level Monte Carlo techniques. Under Feller's condition we also prove that the probability of ever needing the backstop method to prevent a negative value can be made arbitrarily small. Numerically, we compare this adaptive method to fixed step implicit and explicit schemes, and a novel semi-implicit adaptive variant. We observe that the adaptive approach leads to methods that are competitive in a domain that extends beyond Feller's condition, indicating suitability for the modelling of stochastic volatility in Heston-type asset models.", "published": "2020-02-24 12:47:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10206v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.NA"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
