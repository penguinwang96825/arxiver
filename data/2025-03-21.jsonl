{"title": "Local Ratio based Real-time Job Offloading and Resource Allocation in Mobile Edge Computing", "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm enabling\nvehicles to handle computation-intensive and time-sensitive applications for\nintelligent transportation. Due to the limited resources in MEC, effective\nresource management is crucial for improving system performance. While existing\nstudies mostly focus on the job offloading problem and assume that job resource\ndemands are fixed and given apriori, the joint consideration of job offloading\n(selecting the edge server for each job) and resource allocation (determining\nthe bandwidth and computation resources for offloading and processing) remains\nunderexplored. This paper addresses the joint problem for deadline-constrained\njobs in MEC with both communication and computation resource constraints,\naiming to maximize the total utility gained from jobs. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose an approximation algorithm, $\\mathtt{IDAssign}$, with an\napproximation bound of $\\frac{1}{6}$, and experimentally evaluate the\nperformance of $\\mathtt{IDAssign}$ by comparing it to state-of-the-art\nheuristics using a real-world taxi trace and object detection applications.", "published": "2025-03-21 02:06:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16794v1", "categories": ["cs.DC", "cs.DM", "cs.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.DC"}

{"title": "Martingale property and moment explosions in signature volatility models", "abstract": "We study the martingale property and moment explosions of a signature\nvolatility model, where the volatility process of the log-price is given by a\nlinear form of the signature of a time-extended Brownian motion. Excluding\ntrivial cases, we demonstrate that the price process is a true martingale if\nand only if the order of the linear form is odd and a correlation parameter is\nnegative. The proof involves a fine analysis of the explosion time of a\nsignature stochastic differential equation. This result is of key practical\nrelevance, as it highlights that, when used for approximation purposes, the\nlinear combination of signature elements must be taken of odd order to preserve\nthe martingale property. Once martingality is established, we also characterize\nthe existence of higher moments of the price process in terms of a condition on\na correlation parameter.", "published": "2025-03-21 12:42:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17103v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "China and G7 in the Current Context of the World Trading", "abstract": "The paper analyses trade between the most developed economies of the world.\nThe analysis is based on the previously proposed model of international trade.\nThis model of international trade is based on the theory of general economic\nequilibrium. The demand for goods in this model is built on the import of goods\nby each of the countries participating in the trade. The structure of supply of\ngoods in this model is determined by the structure of exports of each country.\nIt is proved that in such a model, given a certain structure of supply and\ndemand, there exists a so-called ideal equilibrium state in which the trade\nbalance of each country is zero. Under certain conditions on the structure of\nsupply and demand, there is an equilibrium state in which each country have a\nstrictly positive trade balance. Among the equilibrium states under a certain\nstructure of supply and demand, there are some that differ from the ones\ndescribed above. Such states are characterized by the fact that there is an\ninequitable distribution of income between the participants in the trade. Such\nstates are called degenerate. In this paper, based on the previously proposed\nmodel of international trade, an analysis of the dynamics of international\ntrade of 8 of the world's most developed economies is made. It is shown that\ntrade between these countries was not in a state of economic equilibrium. The\nfound relative equilibrium price vector turned out to be very degenerate, which\nindicates the unequal exchange of goods on the market of the 8 studied\ncountries. An analysis of the dynamics of supply to the market of the world's\nmost developed economies showed an increase in China's share. The same applies\nto the share of demand.", "published": "2025-03-21 15:26:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17225v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
