{"title": "Exact Solutions for a GBM-type Stochastic Volatility Model having a Stationary Distribution", "abstract": "We find various exact solutions for a new stochastic volatility (SV) model: the transition probability density, European-style option values, and (when it exists) the martingale defect. This may represent the first example of an SV model combining exact solutions, GBM-type volatility noise, and a stationary volatility density.", "published": "2018-09-23 17:11:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08635v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
