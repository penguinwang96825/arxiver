{"title": "Improving the quality of Gujarati-Hindi Machine Translation through\n  part-of-speech tagging and stemmer-assisted transliteration", "abstract": "Machine Translation for Indian languages is an emerging research area.\nTransliteration is one such module that we design while designing a translation\nsystem. Transliteration means mapping of source language text into the target\nlanguage. Simple mapping decreases the efficiency of overall translation\nsystem. We propose the use of stemming and part-of-speech tagging for\ntransliteration. The effectiveness of translation can be improved if we use\npart-of-speech tagging and stemming assisted transliteration.We have shown that\nmuch of the content in Gujarati gets transliterated while being processed for\ntranslation to Hindi language.", "published": "2013-07-12 03:05:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3310v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Opinion Mining and Analysis: A survey", "abstract": "The current research is focusing on the area of Opinion Mining also called as\nsentiment analysis due to sheer volume of opinion rich web resources such as\ndiscussion forums, review sites and blogs are available in digital form. One\nimportant problem in sentiment analysis of product reviews is to produce\nsummary of opinions based on product features. We have surveyed and analyzed in\nthis paper, various techniques that have been developed for the key tasks of\nopinion mining. We have provided an overall picture of what is involved in\ndeveloping a software system for opinion mining on the basis of our survey and\nanalysis.", "published": "2013-07-12 06:20:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3336v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
