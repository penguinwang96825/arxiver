{"title": "Correlation, Network and Multifractal Analysis of Global Financial Indices", "abstract": "We apply RMT, Network and MF-DFA methods to investigate correlation, network and multifractal properties of 20 global financial indices. We compare results before and during the financial crisis of 2008 respectively. We find that the network method gives more useful information about the formation of clusters as compared to results obtained from eigenvectors corresponding to second largest eigenvalue and these sectors are formed on the basis of geographical location of indices. At threshold 0.6, indices corresponding to Americas, Europe and Asia/Pacific disconnect and form different clusters before the crisis but during the crisis, indices corresponding to Americas and Europe are combined together to form a cluster while the Asia/Pacific indices forms another cluster. By further increasing the value of threshold to 0.9, European countries France, Germany and UK constitute the most tightly linked markets. We study multifractal properties of global financial indices and find that financial indices corresponding to Americas and Europe almost lie in the same range of degree of multifractality as compared to other indices. India, South Korea, Hong Kong are found to be near the degree of multifractality of indices corresponding to Americas and Europe. A large variation in the degree of multifractality in Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore may be a reason that when we increase the threshold in financial network these countries first start getting disconnected at low threshold from the correlation network of financial indices. We fit Binomial Multifractal Model (BMFM) to these financial markets.", "published": "2012-02-02 11:20:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0409v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "On return-volatility correlation in financial dynamics", "abstract": "With the daily and minutely data of the German DAX and Chinese indices, we investigate how the return-volatility correlation originates in financial dynamics. Based on a retarded volatility model, we may eliminate or generate the return-volatility correlation of the time series, while other characteristics, such as the probability distribution of returns and long-range time-correlation of volatilities etc., remain essentially unchanged. This suggests that the leverage effect or anti-leverage effect in financial markets arises from a kind of feedback return-volatility interactions, rather than the long-range time-correlation of volatilities and asymmetric probability distribution of returns. Further, we show that large volatilities dominate the return-volatility correlation in financial dynamics.", "published": "2012-02-02 02:54:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0342v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "physics.comp-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
