{"title": "Sensitivity of multiperiod optimization problems in adapted Wasserstein distance", "abstract": "We analyze the effect of small changes in the underlying probabilistic model on the value of multi-period stochastic optimization problems and optimal stopping problems. We work in finite discrete time and measure these changes with the adapted Wasserstein distance. We prove explicit first-order approximations for both problems. Expected utility maximization is discussed as a special case.", "published": "2022-08-11 06:27:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05656v2", "categories": ["math.OC", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
