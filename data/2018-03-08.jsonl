{"title": "How Images Inspire Poems: Generating Classical Chinese Poetry from\n  Images with Memory Networks", "abstract": "With the recent advances of neural models and natural language processing,\nautomatic generation of classical Chinese poetry has drawn significant\nattention due to its artistic and cultural value. Previous works mainly focus\non generating poetry given keywords or other text information, while visual\ninspirations for poetry have been rarely explored. Generating poetry from\nimages is much more challenging than generating poetry from text, since images\ncontain very rich visual information which cannot be described completely using\nseveral keywords, and a good poem should convey the image accurately. In this\npaper, we propose a memory based neural model which exploits images to generate\npoems. Specifically, an Encoder-Decoder model with a topic memory network is\nproposed to generate classical Chinese poetry from images. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work attempting to generate classical Chinese\npoetry from images with neural networks. A comprehensive experimental\ninvestigation with both human evaluation and quantitative analysis demonstrates\nthat the proposed model can generate poems which convey images accurately.", "published": "2018-03-08 08:07:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02994v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Fact Checking in Community Forums", "abstract": "Community Question Answering (cQA) forums are very popular nowadays, as they\nrepresent effective means for communities around particular topics to share\ninformation. Unfortunately, this information is not always factual. Thus, here\nwe explore a new dimension in the context of cQA, which has been ignored so\nfar: checking the veracity of answers to particular questions in cQA forums. As\nthis is a new problem, we create a specialized dataset for it. We further\npropose a novel multi-faceted model, which captures information from the answer\ncontent (what is said and how), from the author profile (who says it), from the\nrest of the community forum (where it is said), and from external authoritative\nsources of information (external support). Evaluation results show a MAP value\nof 86.54, which is 21 points absolute above the baseline.", "published": "2018-03-08 16:06:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03178v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "IcoRating: A Deep-Learning System for Scam ICO Identification", "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies (or digital tokens, digital currencies, e.g., BTC, ETH, XRP,\nNEO) have been rapidly gaining ground in use, value, and understanding among\nthe public, bringing astonishing profits to investors. Unlike other money and\nbanking systems, most digital tokens do not require central authorities. Being\ndecentralized poses significant challenges for credit rating. Most ICOs are\ncurrently not subject to government regulations, which makes a reliable credit\nrating system for ICO projects necessary and urgent.\n  In this paper, we introduce IcoRating, the first learning--based\ncryptocurrency rating system. We exploit natural-language processing techniques\nto analyze various aspects of 2,251 digital currencies to date, such as white\npaper content, founding teams, Github repositories, websites, etc. Supervised\nlearning models are used to correlate the life span and the price change of\ncryptocurrencies with these features. For the best setting, the proposed system\nis able to identify scam ICO projects with 0.83 precision.\n  We hope this work will help investors identify scam ICOs and attract more\nefforts in automatically evaluating and analyzing ICO projects.", "published": "2018-03-08 09:14:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03670v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Cross-domain Recommendation via Deep Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "The behavior of users in certain services could be a clue that can be used to\ninfer their preferences and may be used to make recommendations for other\nservices they have never used. However, the cross-domain relationships between\nitems and user consumption patterns are not simple, especially when there are\nfew or no common users and items across domains. To address this problem, we\npropose a content-based cross-domain recommendation method for cold-start users\nthat does not require user- and item- overlap. We formulate recommendation as\nextreme multi-class classification where labels (items) corresponding to the\nusers are predicted. With this formulation, the problem is reduced to a domain\nadaptation setting, in which a classifier trained in the source domain is\nadapted to the target domain. For this, we construct a neural network that\ncombines an architecture for domain adaptation, Domain Separation Network, with\na denoising autoencoder for item representation. We assess the performance of\nour approach in experiments on a pair of data sets collected from movie and\nnews services of Yahoo! JAPAN and show that our approach outperforms several\nbaseline methods including a cross-domain collaborative filtering method.", "published": "2018-03-08 09:43:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03018v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Feudal Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Management in Large Domains", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to solve dialogue policy\noptimisation. Traditional RL algorithms, however, fail to scale to large\ndomains due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel Dialogue\nManagement architecture, based on Feudal RL, which decomposes the decision into\ntwo steps; a first step where a master policy selects a subset of primitive\nactions, and a second step where a primitive action is chosen from the selected\nsubset. The structural information included in the domain ontology is used to\nabstract the dialogue state space, taking the decisions at each step using\ndifferent parts of the abstracted state. This, combined with an information\nsharing mechanism between slots, increases the scalability to large domains. We\nshow that an implementation of this approach, based on Deep-Q Networks,\nsignificantly outperforms previous state of the art in several dialogue domains\nand environments, without the need of any additional reward signal.", "published": "2018-03-08 18:05:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03232v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
