{"title": "Noisy Computing of the $\\mathsf{OR}$ and $\\mathsf{MAX}$ Functions", "abstract": "We consider the problem of computing a function of $n$ variables using noisy queries, where each query is incorrect with some fixed and known probability $p \\in (0,1/2)$. Specifically, we consider the computation of the $\\mathsf{OR}$ function of $n$ bits (where queries correspond to noisy readings of the bits) and the $\\mathsf{MAX}$ function of $n$ real numbers (where queries correspond to noisy pairwise comparisons). We show that an expected number of queries of \\[ (1 \\pm o(1)) \\frac{n\\log \\frac{1}\u03b4}{D_{\\mathsf{KL}}(p \\| 1-p)} \\] is both sufficient and necessary to compute both functions with a vanishing error probability $\u03b4= o(1)$, where $D_{\\mathsf{KL}}(p \\| 1-p)$ denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between $\\mathsf{Bern}(p)$ and $\\mathsf{Bern}(1-p)$ distributions. Compared to previous work, our results tighten the dependence on $p$ in both the upper and lower bounds for the two functions.", "published": "2023-09-07 19:37:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03986v1", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.AI", "cs.IT", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
