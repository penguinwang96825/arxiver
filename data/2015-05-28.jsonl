{"title": "Overview of the NLPCC 2015 Shared Task: Chinese Word Segmentation and\n  POS Tagging for Micro-blog Texts", "abstract": "In this paper, we give an overview for the shared task at the 4th CCF\nConference on Natural Language Processing \\& Chinese Computing (NLPCC 2015):\nChinese word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging for micro-blog\ntexts. Different with the popular used newswire datasets, the dataset of this\nshared task consists of the relatively informal micro-texts. The shared task\nhas two sub-tasks: (1) individual Chinese word segmentation and (2) joint\nChinese word segmentation and POS Tagging. Each subtask has three tracks to\ndistinguish the systems with different resources. We first introduce the\ndataset and task, then we characterize the different approaches of the\nparticipating systems, report the test results, and provide a overview analysis\nof these results. An online system is available for open registration and\nevaluation at http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpcc2015.", "published": "2015-05-28 08:54:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07599v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Category Theory of Communication Theory", "abstract": "A theory of how agents can come to understand a language is presented. If\nunderstanding a sentence $\\alpha$ is to associate an operator with $\\alpha$\nthat transforms the representational state of the agent as intended by the\nsender, then coming to know a language involves coming to know the operators\nthat correspond to the meaning of any sentence. This involves a higher order\noperator that operates on the possible transformations that operate on the\nrepresentational capacity of the agent. We formalize these constructs using\nconcepts and diagrams analogous to category theory.", "published": "2015-05-28 15:00:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07712v1", "categories": ["cs.IT", "cs.CL", "cs.LO", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}
