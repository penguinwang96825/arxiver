{"title": "A New Approach for Measuring Sentiment Orientation based on\n  Multi-Dimensional Vector Space", "abstract": "This study implements a vector space model approach to measure the sentiment\norientations of words. Two representative vectors for positive/negative\npolarity are constructed using high-dimensional vec-tor space in both an\nunsupervised and a semi-supervised manner. A sentiment ori-entation value per\nword is determined by taking the difference between the cosine distances\nagainst the two reference vec-tors. These two conditions (unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised) are compared against an existing unsupervised method (Turney,\n2002). As a result of our experi-ment, we demonstrate that this novel ap-proach\nsignificantly outperforms the pre-vious unsupervised approach and is more\npractical and data efficient as well.", "published": "2017-12-31 08:44:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00254v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Continuous User Representations through Hybrid Filtering with\n  doc2vec", "abstract": "Players in the online ad ecosystem are struggling to acquire the user data\nrequired for precise targeting. Audience look-alike modeling has the potential\nto alleviate this issue, but models' performance strongly depends on quantity\nand quality of available data. In order to maximize the predictive performance\nof our look-alike modeling algorithms, we propose two novel hybrid filtering\ntechniques that utilize the recent neural probabilistic language model\nalgorithm doc2vec. We apply these methods to data from a large mobile ad\nexchange and additional app metadata acquired from the Apple App store and\nGoogle Play store. First, we model mobile app users through their app usage\nhistories and app descriptions (user2vec). Second, we introduce context\nawareness to that model by incorporating additional user and app-related\nmetadata in model training (context2vec). Our findings are threefold: (1) the\nquality of recommendations provided by user2vec is notably higher than current\nstate-of-the-art techniques. (2) User representations generated through hybrid\nfiltering using doc2vec prove to be highly valuable features in supervised\nmachine learning models for look-alike modeling. This represents the first\napplication of hybrid filtering user models using neural probabilistic language\nmodels, specifically doc2vec, in look-alike modeling. (3) Incorporating context\nmetadata in the doc2vec model training process to introduce context awareness\nhas positive effects on performance and is superior to directly including the\ndata as features in the downstream supervised models.", "published": "2017-12-31 00:51:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00215v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
