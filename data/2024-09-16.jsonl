{"title": "Cross-Lingual News Event Correlation for Stock Market Trend Prediction", "abstract": "In the modern economic landscape, integrating financial services with\nFinancial Technology (FinTech) has become essential, particularly in stock\ntrend analysis. This study addresses the gap in comprehending financial\ndynamics across diverse global economies by creating a structured financial\ndataset and proposing a cross-lingual Natural Language-based Financial\nForecasting (NLFF) pipeline for comprehensive financial analysis. Utilizing\nsentiment analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and semantic textual\nsimilarity, we conducted an analytical examination of news articles to extract,\nmap, and visualize financial event timelines, uncovering the correlation\nbetween news events and stock market trends. Our method demonstrated a\nmeaningful correlation between stock price movements and cross-linguistic news\nsentiments, validated by processing two-year cross-lingual news data on two\nprominent sectors of the Pakistan Stock Exchange. This study offers significant\ninsights into key events, ensuring a substantial decision margin for investors\nthrough effective visualization and providing optimal investment opportunities.", "published": "2024-09-16 06:45:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00024v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
