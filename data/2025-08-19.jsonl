{"title": "The Promise of Large Language Models in Digital Health: Evidence from Sentiment Analysis in Online Health Communities", "abstract": "Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior\nperformance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,\nwith no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement\nlevels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern\nrecognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by\nin-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.\nThis approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in\ndigital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for\npatient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health\nstrategies.", "published": "2025-08-19 17:54:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14032v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

This paper examines\ncommon methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are\ncore elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve\nmapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,\nknown as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these\nsemantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain\nthe corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that\nprediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based\ninterpretability.\n  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,\nconcluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic\nupper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word\nembeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on\nprediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better\ncaptured by the word embeddings.

This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge.

To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,\nwe introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where\nLLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise\nconstitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially\nreduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a\nvision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual\nsimulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law\nand the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level\nevolution.

This has led to an\nintensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique\nthat hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of\nany steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering\nthe original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper\nproposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the\ncover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for\ndata embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption\nStandard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being\nembedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This\nprocess ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The\nperformance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to\nNoise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that\nthe proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR\nranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost\nindistinguishable from the original video.

A\nmulti-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)\nstructured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent\nstages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from\nthe first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient\nassignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may\nbe highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the\nagents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a\nmulti-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which\nguarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is\nthe maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting\nan instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness\n($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair\nalgorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for\nC-Balance.

We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs\nare tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general\nmulti-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios.

Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN\nprimarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting\ngeometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our\napproach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such\nas VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their\npatch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes\nimage latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and\nspatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as\nposition, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the\ndensity of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in\nreconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token\nefficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves\nstrong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by\nincreasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a\nsignificant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art\nreconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially\noutperforming existing methods.

The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary\nfeatures: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total\nfield and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near\nthe boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of\nthe fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances,\nwhich are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical\nparameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but\nwith a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous\nasymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast\nmaterial structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully\ndesigned incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances.\nExtensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks\nand spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and\nclovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the\noccurrence of these resonances.

Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize\npredicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling\nend-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To\naddress the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen\npermutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\\textit{KD-Eval}$,\nusing a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)\n$\\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language\nmodels. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the\nAmazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior\ndynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key\nstructural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,\n(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)\nheterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with\nBackward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and\nprove that it achieves a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$\nepisodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the\nfact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a\nsecond algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning\n(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,\nuser scaling, with a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T+HN})$.

{"title": "Evaluating Particle Filtering for RSS-Based Target Localization under Varying Noise Levels and Sensor Geometries", "abstract": "Target localization is a critical task in various applications, such as\nsearch and rescue, surveillance, and wireless sensor networks. When a target\nemits a radio frequency (RF) signal, spatially distributed sensors can collect\nsignal measurements to estimate the target's location. Among various\nmeasurement modalities, received signal strength (RSS) is particularly\nattractive due to its low cost, low power consumption, and ease of deployment.\nWhile particle filtering has previously been applied to RSS-based target\nlocalization, few studies have systematically analyzed its performance under\nvarying sensor geometries and RSS noise levels. This paper addresses this gap\nby designing and evaluating a particle filtering algorithm for localizing a\nstationary target. The proposed method is compared with a conventional\nRSS-based trilateration approach across different sensor configurations and\nnoise conditions. Simulation results indicate that particle filtering provides\nmore accurate target localization than trilateration, particularly in scenarios\nwith unfavorable sensor geometries and high RSS noise.", "published": "2025-08-19 15:27:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13937v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Distributed Distortion-Aware Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC Systems", "abstract": "The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) architecture is\na promising enabler for 6G, offering spectrum efficiency and ubiquitous\ncoverage. However, real deployments suffer from hardware impairments,\nespecially nonlinear distortion from power amplifiers (PAs), which degrades\nboth communication and sensing. To address this, we propose a movable antenna\n(MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness.\nThe PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial,\nwhere the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points\n(APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions. We\ndesign a distributed distortion-aware worst-case robust optimization framework\nthat explicitly incorporates uncertainty in 3RDCs. First, we analyze the\nworst-case impact of PA distortion on both the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)\nand communication rate. Then, to address the resulting non-convexity, we apply\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) for estimating the 3RDCs. With these, we\njointly optimize beamforming and MA positions under transmit power and sensing\nconstraints. To efficiently solve this highly non-convex problem, we develop an\nMA-enabled self-attention convolutional graph neural network (SACGNN)\nalgorithm.
