{"title": "Two-stage Modeling for Prediction with Confidence", "abstract": "The use of neural networks has been very successful in a wide variety of applications. However, it has recently been observed that it is difficult to generalize the performance of neural networks under the condition of distributional shift. Several efforts have been made to identify potential out-of-distribution inputs. Although existing literature has made significant progress with regard to images and textual data, finance has been overlooked. The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution shift in the credit scoring problem, one of the most important applications of finance. For the potential distribution shift problem, we propose a novel two-stage model. Using the out-of-distribution detection method, data is first separated into confident and unconfident sets. As a second step, we utilize the domain knowledge with a mean-variance optimization in order to provide reliable bounds for unconfident samples. Using empirical results, we demonstrate that our model offers reliable predictions for the vast majority of datasets. It is only a small portion of the dataset that is inherently difficult to judge, and we leave them to the judgment of human beings. Based on the two-stage model, highly confident predictions have been made and potential risks associated with the model have been significantly reduced.", "published": "2022-09-19 08:48:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08848v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Price Formation in Field Prediction Markets: the Wisdom in the Crowd", "abstract": "Prediction markets are a popular, prominent, and successful structure for a collective intelligence platform. However the exact mechanism by which information known to the participating traders is incorporated into the market price is unknown. Kyle (1985) detailed a model for price formation in continuous auctions with information distributed heterogeneously amongst market participants. This paper demonstrates a novel method derived from the Kyle model applied to data from a field experiment prediction market. The method is able to identify traders whose trades have price impact that adds a significant amount of information to the market price. Traders who are not identified as informed in aggregate have price impact consistent with noise trading. Results are reproduced on other prediction market datasets. Ultimately the results provide strong evidence in favor of the Kyle model in a field market setting, and highlight an under-discussed advantage of prediction markets over alternative group forecasting mechanisms: that the operator of the market does not need to have information on the distribution of information amongst participating traders.", "published": "2022-09-19 06:04:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08778v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
