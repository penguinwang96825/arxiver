{"title": "Measuring academic influence: Not all citations are equal", "abstract": "The importance of a research article is routinely measured by counting how\nmany times it has been cited. However, treating all citations with equal weight\nignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to\nautomatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a\ncentral academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine\nthe effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic\ninfluence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in\ntheir own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according\nto their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised\nmachine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that\nachieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best\nfeatures, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a\nreference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these\nfeatures inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index).\nUnlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a\nreference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better\nindicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.", "published": "2015-01-26 21:06:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06587v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
