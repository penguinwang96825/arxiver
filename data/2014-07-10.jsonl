{"title": "Quality Estimation Of Machine Translation Outputs Through Stemming", "abstract": "Machine Translation is the challenging problem for Indian languages. Every\nday we can see some machine translators being developed, but getting a high\nquality automatic translation is still a very distant dream . The correct\ntranslated sentence for Hindi language is rarely found. In this paper, we are\nemphasizing on English-Hindi language pair, so in order to preserve the correct\nMT output we present a ranking system, which employs some machine learning\ntechniques and morphological features. In ranking no human intervention is\nrequired. We have also validated our results by comparing it with human\nranking.", "published": "2014-07-10 05:26:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2694v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Hidden Markov Model Based Part of Speech Tagger for Sinhala Language", "abstract": "In this paper we present a fundamental lexical semantics of Sinhala language\nand a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based Part of Speech (POS) Tagger for Sinhala\nlanguage. In any Natural Language processing task, Part of Speech is a very\nvital topic, which involves analysing of the construction, behaviour and the\ndynamics of the language, which the knowledge could utilized in computational\nlinguistics analysis and automation applications. Though Sinhala is a\nmorphologically rich and agglutinative language, in which words are inflected\nwith various grammatical features, tagging is very essential for further\nanalysis of the language. Our research is based on statistical based approach,\nin which the tagging process is done by computing the tag sequence probability\nand the word-likelihood probability from the given corpus, where the linguistic\nknowledge is automatically extracted from the annotated corpus. The current\ntagger could reach more than 90% of accuracy for known words.", "published": "2014-07-10 23:57:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2989v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
