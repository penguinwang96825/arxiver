{"title": "Deep LSTM for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long short-term memory (LSTM)\nRNNs, are effective network for sequential task like speech recognition. Deeper\nLSTM models perform well on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition,\nbecause of their impressive learning ability. However, it is more difficult to\ntrain a deeper network. We introduce a training framework with layer-wise\ntraining and exponential moving average methods for deeper LSTM models. It is a\ncompetitive framework that LSTM models of more than 7 layers are successfully\ntrained on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin and they outperform the deep\nLSTM models trained by conventional approach. Moreover, in order for online\nstreaming speech recognition applications, the shallow model with low real time\nfactor is distilled from the very deep model. The recognition accuracy have\nlittle loss in the distillation process. Therefore, the model trained with the\nproposed training framework reduces relative 14\\% character error rate,\ncompared to original model which has the similar real-time capability.\nFurthermore, the novel transfer learning strategy with segmental Minimum\nBayes-Risk is also introduced in the framework. The strategy makes it possible\nthat training with only a small part of dataset could outperform full dataset\ntraining from the beginning.", "published": "2017-03-21 08:24:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07090v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Investigation of Language Understanding Impact for Reinforcement\n  Learning Based Dialogue Systems", "abstract": "Language understanding is a key component in a spoken dialogue system. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the language understanding module influences the\ndialogue system performance by conducting a series of systematic experiments on\na task-oriented neural dialogue system in a reinforcement learning based\nsetting. The empirical study shows that among different types of language\nunderstanding errors, slot-level errors can have more impact on the overall\nperformance of a dialogue system compared to intent-level errors. In addition,\nour experiments demonstrate that the reinforcement learning based dialogue\nsystem is able to learn when and what to confirm in order to achieve better\nperformance and greater robustness.", "published": "2017-03-21 04:56:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07055v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
