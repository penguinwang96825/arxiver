{"title": "Stratified and Time-aware Sampling based Adaptive Ensemble Learning for Streaming Recommendations", "abstract": "Recommender systems have played an increasingly important role in providing users with tailored suggestions based on their preferences. However, the conventional offline recommender systems cannot handle the ubiquitous data stream well. To address this issue, Streaming Recommender Systems (SRSs) have emerged in recent years, which incrementally train recommendation models on newly received data for effective real-time recommendations. Focusing on new data only benefits addressing concept drift, i.e., the changing user preferences towards items. However, it impedes capturing long-term user preferences. In addition, the commonly existing underload and overload problems should be well tackled for higher accuracy of streaming recommendations. To address these problems, we propose a Stratified and Time-aware Sampling based Adaptive Ensemble Learning framework, called STS-AEL, to improve the accuracy of streaming recommendations. In STS-AEL, we first devise stratified and time-aware sampling to extract representative data from both new data and historical data to address concept drift while capturing long-term user preferences. Also, incorporating the historical data benefits utilizing the idle resources in the underload scenario more effectively. After that, we propose adaptive ensemble learning to efficiently process the overloaded data in parallel with multiple individual recommendation models, and then effectively fuse the results of these models with a sequential adaptive mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STS-AEL, in all the cases, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SRSs.", "published": "2020-09-15 02:00:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06824v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Improve black-box sequential anomaly detector relevancy with limited user feedback", "abstract": "Anomaly detectors are often designed to catch statistical anomalies. End-users typically do not have interest in all of the detected outliers, but only those relevant to their application. Given an existing black-box sequential anomaly detector, this paper proposes a method to improve its user relevancy using a small number of human feedback. As our first contribution, the method is agnostic to the detector: it only assumes access to its anomaly scores, without requirement on any additional information inside it. Inspired by a fact that anomalies are of different types, our approach identifies these types and utilizes user feedback to assign relevancy to types. This relevancy score, as our second contribution, is used to adjust the subsequent anomaly selection process. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach yields significant improvements on precision and recall over a range of anomaly detectors.", "published": "2020-09-15 17:26:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07241v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
