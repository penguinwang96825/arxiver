{"title": "Reconstruction of complete interval tournaments", "abstract": "Let $a,  b$ and $n$ be nonnegative integers $(b \\geq a, \\ b > 0, \\ n \\geq 1)$, $\\mathcal{G}_n(a,b)$ be a multigraph on $n$ vertices in which any pair of vertices is connected with at least $a$ and at most $b$ edges and \\textbf{v =} $(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)$ be a vector containing $n$ nonnegative integers. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such orientation of the edges of $\\mathcal{G}_n(a,b)$, that the resulted out-degree vector equals to \\textbf{v}. We describe a reconstruction algorithm. In worst case checking of \\textbf{v} requires $\u0398(n)$ time and the reconstruction algorithm works in $O(bn^3)$ time.  Theorems of H. G. Landau (1953) and J. W. Moon (1963) on the score sequences of tournaments are special cases $b = a = 1$ resp. $b = a \\geq 1$ of our result.", "published": "2010-03-21 19:25:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4016v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
