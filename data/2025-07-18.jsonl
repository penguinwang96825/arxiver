Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them.

In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers.

When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible\npaths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial\nexplosion makes error diagnosis hard.

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism.

In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space.

However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard\nhierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we\nintroduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical\nparadigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates\naction selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior,\ngenerated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration\nprobabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained\noperator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a\nlong-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid\narchitecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive,\nevidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse\ndatasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to\n13.9\\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\\times$ faster convergence\ncompared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.", "published": "2025-07-18 07:43:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13710v1", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DB"}

Within MDD,\nphoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve\ntheir pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of\npronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic\nunits. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use\nmodern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first\npropose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR\nmodels for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes\nall possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a\ntheoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves\npotential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the\nmethod applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We\nprovide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762\ndatasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the\ndependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount\nof context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with\nrecent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors\nderived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on\nphoneme-level pronunciation assessment.", "published": "2025-07-18 04:00:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16838v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
