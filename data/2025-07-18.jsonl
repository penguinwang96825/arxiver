{"title": "Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices", "abstract": "The notion of oriented line graphs is introduced by Kotani and Sunada, and\nthey are closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix. It is known\nthat for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the\noriented line graph $\\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the\nIhara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomial of the\nadjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\\vec{L}(G)$ and the\nskew-symmetric adjacency matrix of $\\vec{L}(G)$ for $d$-regular graphs $G$ with\n$d\\geq 3$. We also exhibit a consequence of this result to star coloring of\nregular graphs.", "published": "2025-07-18 11:20:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821v1", "categories": ["math.CO", "cs.DM"], "primary_category": "math.CO"}
