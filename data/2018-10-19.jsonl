{"title": "On the complexity of color-avoiding site and bond percolation", "abstract": "The mathematical analysis of robustness and error-tolerance of complex networks has been in the center of research interest. On the other hand, little work has been done when the attack-tolerance of the vertices or edges are not independent but certain classes of vertices or edges share a mutual vulnerability. In this study, we consider a graph and we assign colors to the vertices or edges, where the color-classes correspond to the shared vulnerabilities. An important problem is to find robustly connected vertex sets: nodes that remain connected to each other by paths providing any type of error (i.e. erasing any vertices or edges of the given color). This is also known as color-avoiding percolation. In this paper, we study various possible modeling approaches of shared vulnerabilities, we analyze the computational complexity of finding the robustly (color-avoiding) connected components. We find that the presented approaches differ significantly regarding their complexity.", "published": "2018-10-19 13:19:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08484v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CC", "cs.SI", "math.CO", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
