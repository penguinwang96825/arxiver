{"title": "Neural Generative Question Answering", "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end neural network model, named Neural\nGenerative Question Answering (GENQA), that can generate answers to simple\nfactoid questions, based on the facts in a knowledge-base. More specifically,\nthe model is built on the encoder-decoder framework for sequence-to-sequence\nlearning, while equipped with the ability to enquire the knowledge-base, and is\ntrained on a corpus of question-answer pairs, with their associated triples in\nthe knowledge-base. Empirical study shows the proposed model can effectively\ndeal with the variations of questions and answers, and generate right and\nnatural answers by referring to the facts in the knowledge-base. The experiment\non question answering demonstrates that the proposed model can outperform an\nembedding-based QA model as well as a neural dialogue model trained on the same\ndata.", "published": "2015-12-04 08:31:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01337v4", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "What Makes it Difficult to Understand a Scientific Literature?", "abstract": "In the artificial intelligence area, one of the ultimate goals is to make\ncomputers understand human language and offer assistance. In order to achieve\nthis ideal, researchers of computer science have put forward a lot of models\nand algorithms attempting at enabling the machine to analyze and process human\nnatural language on different levels of semantics. Although recent progress in\nthis field offers much hope, we still have to ask whether current research can\nprovide assistance that people really desire in reading and comprehension. To\nthis end, we conducted a reading comprehension test on two scientific papers\nwhich are written in different styles. We use the semantic link models to\nanalyze the understanding obstacles that people will face in the process of\nreading and figure out what makes it difficult for human to understand a\nscientific literature. Through such analysis, we summarized some\ncharacteristics and problems which are reflected by people with different\nlevels of knowledge on the comprehension of difficult science and technology\nliterature, which can be modeled in semantic link network. We believe that\nthese characteristics and problems will help us re-examine the existing machine\nmodels and are helpful in the designing of new one.", "published": "2015-12-04 14:01:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01409v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Locally Adaptive Translation for Knowledge Graph Embedding", "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding aims to represent entities and relations in a\nlarge-scale knowledge graph as elements in a continuous vector space. Existing\nmethods, e.g., TransE and TransH, learn embedding representation by defining a\nglobal margin-based loss function over the data. However, the optimal loss\nfunction is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a\nclosed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with\ndifferent entities and relations share the same set of candidate loss\nfunctions, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited\nperformance of embedding related applications. In this paper, we propose a\nlocally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called\nTransA, to find the optimal loss function by adaptively determining its margin\nover different knowledge graphs. Experiments on two benchmark data sets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to\nthe-state-of-the-art ones.", "published": "2015-12-04 11:09:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01370v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "I.2.4; I.2.6"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Topic segmentation via community detection in complex networks", "abstract": "Many real systems have been modelled in terms of network concepts, and\nwritten texts are a particular example of information networks. In recent\nyears, the use of network methods to analyze language has allowed the discovery\nof several interesting findings, including the proposition of novel models to\nexplain the emergence of fundamental universal patterns. While syntactical\nnetworks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display\nboth scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in\ncapturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or\nsubjects. In this context, we propose a novel network representation whose main\npurpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To\ndo so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is\ndefined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours\nthe emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature\nmay be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect\ntopics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that,\nin general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations,\nwhich suggests that a high-level textual representation may be useful to study\nsemantical features of texts.", "published": "2015-12-04 12:22:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01384v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning the Semantics of Manipulation Action", "abstract": "In this paper we present a formal computational framework for modeling\nmanipulation actions. The introduced formalism leads to semantics of\nmanipulation action and has applications to both observing and understanding\nhuman manipulation actions as well as executing them with a robotic mechanism\n(e.g. a humanoid robot). It is based on a Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The\ngoal of the introduced framework is to: (1) represent manipulation actions with\nboth syntax and semantic parts, where the semantic part employs\n$\\lambda$-calculus; (2) enable a probabilistic semantic parsing schema to learn\nthe $\\lambda$-calculus representation of manipulation action from an annotated\naction corpus of videos; (3) use (1) and (2) to develop a system that visually\nobserves manipulation actions and understands their meaning while it can reason\nbeyond observations using propositional logic and axiom schemata. The\nexperiments conducted on a public available large manipulation action dataset\nvalidate the theoretical framework and our implementation.", "published": "2015-12-04 20:00:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01525v1", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
