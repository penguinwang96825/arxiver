{"title": "Eigenvector Overlaps of Random Covariance Matrices and their Submatrices", "abstract": "We consider the singular vectors of any $m \\times n$ submatrix of a\nrectangular $M \\times N$ Gaussian matrix and study their asymptotic overlaps\nwith those of the full matrix, in the macroscopic regime where $N \\,/\\, M\\,$,\n$m \\,/\\, M$ as well as $n \\,/\\, N$ converge to fixed ratios. Our method makes\nuse of the dynamics of the singular vectors and of specific resolvents when the\nmatrix coefficients follow Brownian trajectories. We obtain explicit forms for\nthe limiting rescaled mean squared overlaps for right and left singular vectors\nin the bulk of both spectra, for any initial matrix $A\\,$. When it is null,\nthis corresponds to the Marchenko-Pastur setup for covariance matrices, and our\nformulas simplify into Cauchy-like functions.", "published": "2025-01-15 12:41:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08768v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
{"title": "Empirical Study on the Factors Influencing Stock Market Volatility in China", "abstract": "This paper mainly utilizes the ARDL model and principal component analysis to\ninvestigate the relationship between the volatility of China's Shanghai\nComposite Index returns and the variables of exchange rate and domestic and\nforeign bond yields in an internationally integrated stock market. This paper\nuses a daily data set for the period from July 1, 2010 to April 30, 2024, in\nwhich the dependent variable is the Shanghai Composite Index return, and the\nmain independent variables are the spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US\ndollar, the 10-year treasury bond yields in China and the United States and\ntheir lagged variables, with the effect of the time factor added. Firstly, the\ndevelopment of the stock, foreign exchange and bond markets and the basic\ntheories are reviewed, and then each variable is analyzed by descriptive\nstatistics, the correlation between the independent variables and the dependent\nvariable is expanded theoretically, and the corresponding empirical analyses\nare briefly introduced, and then the empirical analyses and modeling of the\nrelationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable are\ncarried out on the basis of the theoretical foundations mentioned above with\nthe support of the daily data, and the model conclusions are analyzed\neconomically through a large number of tests, then the model conclusions are\nanalyzed economically. economic analysis of the model conclusions, and finally,\nthe author proposes three suggestions to enhance the stability and return of\nthe Chinese stock market, respectively.\n  Key Words: Chinese Stock Market, Volatility, GARCH, ARDL Model", "published": "2025-01-15 09:02:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08668v1", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "econ.GN"}
{"title": "Deep Learning Meets Queue-Reactive: A Framework for Realistic Limit Order Book Simulation", "abstract": "The Queue-Reactive model introduced by Huang et al. (2015) has become a\nstandard tool for limit order book modeling, widely adopted by both researchers\nand practitioners for its simplicity and effectiveness. We present the\nMultidimensional Deep Queue-Reactive (MDQR) model, which extends this framework\nin three ways: it relaxes the assumption of queue independence, enriches the\nstate space with market features, and models the distribution of order sizes.\nThrough a neural network architecture, the model learns complex dependencies\nbetween different price levels and adapts to varying market conditions, while\npreserving the interpretable point-process foundation of the original\nframework. Using data from the Bund futures market, we show that MDQR captures\nkey market properties including the square-root law of market impact,\ncross-queue correlations, and realistic order size patterns. The model\ndemonstrates particular strength in reproducing both conditional and stationary\ndistributions of order sizes, as well as various stylized facts of market\nmicrostructure. The model achieves this while maintaining the computational\nefficiency needed for practical applications such as strategy development\nthrough reinforcement learning or realistic backtesting.", "published": "2025-01-15 14:19:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08822v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
