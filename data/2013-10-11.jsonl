{"title": "A Bayesian Network View on Acoustic Model-Based Techniques for Robust\n  Speech Recognition", "abstract": "This article provides a unifying Bayesian network view on various approaches\nfor acoustic model adaptation, missing feature, and uncertainty decoding that\nare well-known in the literature of robust automatic speech recognition. The\nrepresentatives of these classes can often be deduced from a Bayesian network\nthat extends the conventional hidden Markov models used in speech recognition.\nThese extensions, in turn, can in many cases be motivated from an underlying\nobservation model that relates clean and distorted feature vectors. By\nconverting the observation models into a Bayesian network representation, we\nformulate the corresponding compensation rules leading to a unified view on\nknown derivations as well as to new formulations for certain approaches. The\ngeneric Bayesian perspective provided in this contribution thus highlights\nstructural differences and similarities between the analyzed approaches.", "published": "2013-10-11 12:07:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3099v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
