{"title": "Phonetic based SoundEx & ShapeEx algorithm for Sindhi Spell Checker\n  System", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel combinational phonetic algorithm for Sindhi\nLanguage, to be used in developing Sindhi Spell Checker which has yet not been\ndeveloped prior to this work. The compound textual forms and glyphs of Sindhi\nlanguage presents a substantial challenge for developing Sindhi spell checker\nsystem and generating similar suggestion list for misspelled words. In order to\nimplement such a system, phonetic based Sindhi language rules and patterns must\nbe considered into account for increasing the accuracy and efficiency. The\nproposed system is developed with a blend between Phonetic based SoundEx\nalgorithm and ShapeEx algorithm for pattern or glyph matching, generating\naccurate and efficient suggestion list for incorrect or misspelled Sindhi\nwords. A table of phonetically similar sounding Sindhi characters for SoundEx\nalgorithm is also generated along with another table containing similar glyph\nor shape based character groups for ShapeEx algorithm. Both these are first\never attempt of any such type of categorization and representation for Sindhi\nLanguage.", "published": "2014-05-13 04:33:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3033v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Fast and Fuzzy Private Set Intersection", "abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) is usually implemented as a sequence of\nencryption rounds between pairs of users, whereas the present work implements\nPSI in a simpler fashion: each set only needs to be encrypted once, after which\neach pair of users need only one ordinary set comparison. This is typically\norders of magnitude faster than ordinary PSI at the cost of some ``fuzziness\"\nin the matching, which may nonetheless be tolerable or even desirable. This is\ndemonstrated in the case where the sets consist of English words processed with\nWordNet.", "published": "2014-05-13 19:38:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3272v2", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}
{"title": "How to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic\n  Requests", "abstract": "Requests are at the core of many social media systems such as question &\nanswer sites and online philanthropy communities. While the success of such\nrequests is critical to the success of the community, the factors that lead\ncommunity members to satisfy a request are largely unknown. Success of a\nrequest depends on factors like who is asking, how they are asking, when are\nthey asking, and most critically what is being requested, ranging from small\nfavors to substantial monetary donations. We present a case study of altruistic\nrequests in an online community where all requests ask for the very same\ncontribution and do not offer anything tangible in return, allowing us to\ndisentangle what is requested from textual and social factors. Drawing from\nsocial psychology literature, we extract high-level social features from text\nthat operationalize social relations between recipient and donor and\ndemonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success. More\nspecifically, we find that clearly communicating need through the narrative is\nessential and that that linguistic indications of gratitude, evidentiality, and\ngeneralized reciprocity, as well as high status of the asker further increase\nthe likelihood of success. Building on this understanding, we develop a model\nthat can predict the success of unseen requests, significantly improving over\nseveral baselines. We link these findings to research in psychology on helping\nbehavior, providing a basis for further analysis of success in social media\nsystems.", "published": "2014-05-13 20:00:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3282v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "I.2.7; J.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
