{"title": "Economic effects on households of an augmentation of the cash back duration of real estate loan", "abstract": "This article examines the economic effects of an increase in the duration of\nhome loans on households, focusing on the French real estate market. It\nhighlights trends in the property market, existing loan systems in other\ncountries (such as bullet loans in Sweden and Japanese home loans), the current\nstate of the property market in France, the potential effects of an increase in\nthe amortization period of home loans, and the financial implications for\nhouseholds.The article points out that increasing the repayment period on home\nloans could reduce the amount of monthly instalments to be repaid, thereby\nfacilitating access to credit for the most modest households. However, this\nmeasure also raises concerns about overall credit costs, financial stability\nand the impact on property prices. In addition, it highlights the differences\nbetween existing lending systems in other countries, such as the bullet loan in\nSweden and Japanese home loans, and the current characteristics of home loans\nin France, notably interest rates and house price trends. The article proposes\na model of the potential effects of an increase in the amortization period of\nhome loans on housing demand, housing supply, property prices and the\nassociated financial risks.In conclusion, the article highlights the crucial\nimportance of household debt for individual and economic financial stability.\nIt highlights the distortion between supply and demand for home loans as\namortization periods increase, and the significant rise in overall loan costs\nfor households. It also underlines the need to address structural issues such\nas the sustainable reduction in interest rates, the stabilization of banks'\nequity capital and the development of a regulatory framework for\nintergenerational lending to ensure a properly functioning market.", "published": "2024-09-23 06:52:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14748v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "From Gini index as a Lyapunov functional to convergence in Wasserstein distance", "abstract": "In several recent works on infinite-dimensional systems of ODEs\n\\cite{cao_derivation_2021,cao_explicit_2021,cao_iterative_2024,cao_sticky_2024},\nwhich arise from the mean-field limit of agent-based models in economics and\nsocial sciences and model the evolution of probability distributions (on the\nset of non-negative integers), it is often shown that the Gini index serves as\na natural Lyapunov functional along the solution to a given system.\nFurthermore, the Gini index converges to that of the equilibrium distribution.\nHowever, it is not immediately clear whether this convergence at the level of\nthe Gini index implies convergence in the sense of probability distributions or\neven stronger notions of convergence. In this paper, we prove several results\nin this direction, highlighting the interplay between the Gini index and other\npopular metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance and the usual $\\ell^p$\ndistance, which are used to quantify the closeness of probability\ndistributions.", "published": "2024-09-23 17:14:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15225v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.CA", "math.PR", "34A35, 91B80, 91B70, 60J28"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Consistent Estimation of the High-Dimensional Efficient Frontier", "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the main characteristics\nof the mean-variance efficient frontier employing random matrix theory. Our\nparticular interest covers the case when the dimension $p$ and the sample size\n$n$ tend to infinity simultaneously and their ratio $p/n$ tends to a positive\nconstant $c\\in(0,1)$. We neither impose any distributional nor structural\nassumptions on the asset returns. For the developed theoretical framework, some\nregularity conditions, like the existence of the $4$th moments, are needed.\n  It is shown that two out of three quantities of interest are biased and\noverestimated by their sample counterparts under the high-dimensional\nasymptotic regime. This becomes evident based on the asymptotic deterministic\nequivalents of the sample plug-in estimators. Using them we construct\nconsistent estimators of the three characteristics of the efficient frontier.\nIt it shown that the additive and/or the multiplicative biases of the sample\nestimates are solely functions of the concentration ratio $c$. Furthermore, the\nasymptotic normality of the considered estimators of the parameters of the\nefficient frontier is proved. Verifying the theoretical results based on an\nextensive simulation study we show that the proposed estimator for the\nefficient frontier is a valuable alternative to the sample estimator for high\ndimensional data. Finally, we present an empirical application, where we\nestimate the efficient frontier based on the stocks included in S\\&P 500 index.", "published": "2024-09-23 15:16:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15103v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "math.ST", "q-fin.MF", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Position-building in competition with real-world constraints", "abstract": "This paper extends the optimal-trading framework developed in\narXiv:2409.03586v1 to compute optimal strategies with real-world constraints.\nThe aim of the current paper, as with the previous, is to study trading in the\ncontext of multi-player non-cooperative games. While the former paper relies on\nmethods from the calculus of variations and optimal strategies arise as the\nsolution of partial differential equations, the current paper demonstrates that\nthe entire framework may be re-framed as a quadratic programming problem and\ncast in this light constraints are readily incorporated into the calculation of\noptimal strategies. An added benefit is that two-trader equilibria may be\ncalculated as the end-points of a dynamic process of traders forming repeated\nadjustments to each other's strategy.", "published": "2024-09-23 18:36:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15459v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.GT"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
