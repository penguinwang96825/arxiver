{"title": "A General Dependency Structure for Random Graphs and Its Effect on Monotone Properties", "abstract": "We consider random graphs in which the edges are allowed to be dependent. In our model the edge dependence is quite general, we call it $p$-robust random graph. It means that every edge is present with probability at least $p$, regardless of the presence/absence of other edges. This is more general than independent edges with probability $p$, as we illustrate with examples. Our main result is that for any monotone graph property, the $p$-robust random graph has at least as high probability to have the property as an Erdos-Renyi random graph with edge probability $p$. This is very useful, as it allows the adaptation of many results from classical Erdos-Renyi random graphs to a non-independent setting, as lower bounds.", "published": "2020-12-03 16:32:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02050v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
