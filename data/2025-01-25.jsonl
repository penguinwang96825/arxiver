{"title": "In-Context Operator Learning for Linear Propagator Models", "abstract": "We study operator learning in the context of linear propagator models for\noptimal order execution problems with transient price impact \\`a la Bouchaud et\nal. (2004) and Gatheral (2010). Transient price impact persists and decays over\ntime according to some propagator kernel. Specifically, we propose to use\nIn-Context Operator Networks (ICON), a novel transformer-based neural network\narchitecture introduced by Yang et al. (2023), which facilitates data-driven\nlearning of operators by merging offline pre-training with an online few-shot\nprompting inference. First, we train ICON to learn the operator from various\npropagator models that maps the trading rate to the induced transient price\nimpact. The inference step is then based on in-context prediction, where ICON\nis presented only with a few examples. We illustrate that ICON is capable of\naccurately inferring the underlying price impact model from the data prompts,\neven with propagator kernels not seen in the training data. In a second step,\nwe employ the pre-trained ICON model provided with context as a surrogate\noperator in solving an optimal order execution problem via a neural network\ncontrol policy, and demonstrate that the exact optimal execution strategies\nfrom Abi Jaber and Neuman (2022) for the models generating the context are\ncorrectly retrieved. Our introduced methodology is very general, offering a new\napproach to solving optimal stochastic control problems with unknown state\ndynamics, inferred data-efficiently from a limited number of examples by\nleveraging the few-shot and transfer learning capabilities of transformer\nnetworks.", "published": "2025-01-25 07:15:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15106v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "q-fin.CP", "93E20, 91G60, 68T07"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
