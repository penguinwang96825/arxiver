{"title": "Risk-aware Trading Portfolio Optimization", "abstract": "We investigate portfolio optimization in financial markets from a trading and\nrisk management perspective. We term this task Risk-Aware Trading Portfolio\nOptimization (RATPO), formulate the corresponding optimization problem, and\npropose an efficient Risk-Aware Trading Swarm (RATS) algorithm to solve it. The\nkey elements of RATPO are a generic initial portfolio P, a specific set of\nUnique Eligible Instruments (UEIs), their combination into an Eligible\nOptimization Strategy (EOS), an objective function, and a set of constraints.\nRATS searches for an optimal EOS that, added to P, improves the objective\nfunction repecting the constraints.\n  RATS is a specialized Particle Swarm Optimization method that leverages the\nparameterization of P in terms of UEIs, enables parallel computation with a\nlarge number of particles, and is fully general with respect to specific\nchoices of the key elements, which can be customized to encode financial\nknowledge and needs of traders and risk managers.\n  We showcase two RATPO applications involving a real trading portfolio made of\nhundreds of different financial instruments, an objective function combining\nboth market risk (VaR) and profit&loss measures, constrains on market\nsensitivities and UEIs trading costs. In the case of small-sized EOS, RATS\nsuccessfully identifies the optimal solution and demonstrates robustness with\nrespect to hyper-parameters tuning. In the case of large-sized EOS, RATS\nmarkedly improves the portfolio objective value, optimizing risk and capital\ncharge while respecting risk limits and preserving expected profits.\n  Our work bridges the gap between the implementation of effective trading\nstrategies and compliance with stringent regulatory and economic capital\nrequirements, allowing a better alignment of business and risk management\nobjectives.", "published": "2025-03-06 17:56:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04662v1", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.PM", "91G10, 91G60 (primary) 90-08 (secondary)"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "Are Large Language Models Good In-context Learners for Financial Sentiment Analysis?", "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of\nparameters have demonstrated the emergent ability, surpassing traditional\nmethods in various domains even without fine-tuning over domain-specific data.\nHowever, when it comes to financial sentiment analysis (FSA)$\\unicode{x2013}$a\nfundamental task in financial AI$\\unicode{x2013}$these models often encounter\nvarious challenges, such as complex financial terminology, subjective human\nemotions, and ambiguous inclination expressions. In this paper, we aim to\nanswer the fundamental question: whether LLMs are good in-context learners for\nFSA? Unveiling this question can yield informative insights on whether LLMs can\nlearn to address the challenges by generalizing in-context demonstrations of\nfinancial document-sentiment pairs to the sentiment analysis of new documents,\ngiven that finetuning these models on finance-specific data is difficult, if\nnot impossible at all. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper\nexploring in-context learning for FSA that covers most modern LLMs (recently\nreleased DeepSeek V3 included) and multiple in-context sample selection\nmethods.

{"title": "Hedging with Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Derivatives, as a critical class of financial instruments, isolate and trade\nthe price attributes of risk assets such as stocks, commodities, and indices,\naiding risk management and enhancing market efficiency. However, traditional\nhedging models, constrained by assumptions such as continuous trading and zero\ntransaction costs, fail to satisfy risk control requirements in complex and\nuncertain real-world markets.\n  With advances in computing technology and deep learning, data-driven trading\nstrategies are becoming increasingly prevalent. This thesis proposes a\nderivatives hedging framework integrating deep learning and reinforcement\nlearning. The framework comprises a probabilistic forecasting model and a\nhedging agent, enabling market probability prediction, derivative pricing, and\nhedging.\n  Specifically, we design a spatiotemporal attention-based probabilistic\nfinancial time series forecasting Transformer to address the scarcity of\nderivatives hedging data. A low-rank attention mechanism compresses\nhigh-dimensional assets into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing\nnonlinear asset relationships. The Transformer models sequential dependencies\nwithin this latent space, improving market probability forecasts and\nconstructing an online training environment for downstream hedging tasks.\n  Additionally, we incorporate generalized geometric Brownian motion to develop\na risk-neutral pricing approach for derivatives. We model derivatives hedging\nas a reinforcement learning problem with sparse rewards and propose a behavior\ncloning-based recurrent proximal policy optimization (BC-RPPO) algorithm. This\npretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the hedging agent's\nperformance. Numerical experiments in the U.S. and Chinese financial markets\ndemonstrate our method's superiority over traditional approaches.", "published": "2025-03-06 08:53:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04218v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

However, these models fail to capture the stylized facts commonly\nobserved in financial data, limiting their practical applicability. Recently,\nmachine learning models have been introduced to address the limitations of\nstatistical models; however, controlling synthetic data generation remains\nchallenging. We propose CoFinDiff (Controllable Financial Diffusion model), a\nsynthetic financial data generation model based on conditional diffusion models\nthat accept conditions about the synthetic time series. By incorporating\nconditions derived from price data into the conditional diffusion model via\ncross-attention, CoFinDiff learns the relationships between the conditions and\nthe data, generating synthetic data that align with arbitrary conditions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that: (i) synthetic data generated by\nCoFinDiff capture stylized facts; (ii) the generated data accurately meet\nspecified conditions for trends and volatility; (iii) the diversity of the\ngenerated data surpasses that of the baseline models; and (iv) models trained\non CoFinDiff-generated data achieve improved performance in deep hedging task.", "published": "2025-03-06 07:25:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04164v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Fredholm Approach to Nonlinear Propagator Models", "abstract": "We formulate and solve an optimal trading problem with alpha signals, where\ntransactions induce a nonlinear transient price impact described by a general\npropagator model, including power-law decay.

We prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution under a monotonicity condition\nreflecting the nonlinearity of the price impact. Moreover, we derive an\nexistence result for the optimal strategy beyond this condition when the\nunderlying probability space is countable.

{"title": "Matrix H-theory approach to stock market fluctuations", "abstract": "We introduce matrix H theory, a framework for analyzing collective behavior\narising from multivariate stochastic processes with hierarchical structure. The\ntheory models the joint distribution of the multiple variables (the measured\nsignal) as a compound of a large-scale multivariate distribution with the\ndistribution of a slowly fluctuating background. The background is\ncharacterized by a hierarchical stochastic evolution of internal degrees of\nfreedom, representing the correlations between stocks at different time scales.\nAs in its univariate version, the matrix H-theory formalism also has two\nuniversality classes: Wishart and inverse Wishart, enabling a concise\ndescription of both the background and the signal probability distributions in\nterms of Meijer G-functions with matrix argument. Empirical analysis of daily\nreturns of stocks within the S&P500 demonstrates the effectiveness of matrix H\ntheory in describing fluctuations in stock markets. These findings contribute\nto a deeper understanding of multivariate hierarchical processes and offer\npotential for developing more informed portfolio strategies in financial\nmarkets.", "published": "2025-03-06 01:40:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08697v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
