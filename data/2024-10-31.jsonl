{"title": "Moments by Integrating the Moment-Generating Function", "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for obtaining a wide variety of moments of a\nrandom variable with a well-defined moment-generating function (MGF). We derive\nnew expressions for fractional moments and fractional absolute moments, both\ncentral and non-central moments. The new moment expressions are relatively\nsimple integrals that involve the MGF, but do not require its derivatives. We\nlabel the new method CMGF because it uses a complex extension of the MGF and\ncan be used to obtain complex moments. We illustrate the new method with three\napplications where the MGF is available in closed-form, while the corresponding\ndensities and the derivatives of the MGF are either unavailable or very\ndifficult to obtain.", "published": "2024-10-31 02:58:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23587v3", "categories": ["econ.EM", "q-fin.CP", "stat.CO"], "primary_category": "econ.EM"}
{"title": "On Cost-Sensitive Distributionally Robust Log-Optimal Portfolio", "abstract": "This paper addresses a novel \\emph{cost-sensitive} distributionally robust\nlog-optimal portfolio problem, where the investor faces \\emph{ambiguous} return\ndistributions, and a general convex transaction cost model is incorporated. The\nuncertainty in the return distribution is quantified using the\n\\emph{Wasserstein} metric, which captures distributional ambiguity. We\nestablish conditions that ensure robustly survivable trades for all\ndistributions in the Wasserstein ball under convex transaction costs. By\nleveraging duality theory, we approximate the infinite-dimensional\ndistributionally robust optimization problem with a finite convex program,\nenabling computational tractability for mid-sized portfolios. Empirical studies\nusing S\\&P 500 data validate our theoretical framework: without transaction\ncosts, the optimal portfolio converges to an equal-weighted allocation, while\nwith transaction costs, the portfolio shifts slightly towards the risk-free\nasset, reflecting the trade-off between cost considerations and optimal\nallocation.", "published": "2024-10-31 00:56:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23536v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.SY", "eess.SY", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.PM", "91G10, 93E03, 90C17, 90C46, 90C25"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "A dynamic programming principle for multiperiod control problems with bicausal constraints", "abstract": "We consider multiperiod stochastic control problems with non-parametric\nuncertainty on the underlying probabilistic model. We derive a new metric on\nthe space of probability measures, called the adapted $(p,\n\\infty)$--Wasserstein distance $\\mathcal{AW}_p^\\infty$ with the following\nproperties: (1) the adapted $(p, \\infty)$--Wasserstein distance generates a\ntopology that guarantees continuity of stochastic control problems and (2) the\ncorresponding $\\mathcal{AW}_p^\\infty$-distributionally robust optimization\n(DRO) problem can be computed via a dynamic programming principle involving\none-step Wasserstein-DRO problems.

{"title": "Deep Learning in Long-Short Stock Portfolio Allocation: An Empirical Study", "abstract": "This paper provides an empirical study explores the application of deep\nlearning algorithms-Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer-in constructing\nlong-short stock portfolios. Two datasets comprising randomly selected stocks\nfrom the S&P500 and NASDAQ indices, each spanning a decade of daily data, are\nutilized. The models predict daily stock returns based on historical features\nsuch as past returns,Relative Strength Index (RSI), trading volume, and\nvolatility. Portfolios are dynamically adjusted by longing stocks with positive\npredicted returns and shorting those with negative predictions, with equal\nasset weights. Performance is evaluated over a two-year testing period,\nfocusing on return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics. The results\ndemonstrate the efficacy of deep learning models in enhancing long-short stock\nportfolio performance.", "published": "2024-10-31 10:48:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13555v3", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
