{"title": "KnowNER: Incremental Multilingual Knowledge in Named Entity Recognition", "abstract": "KnowNER is a multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that\nleverages different degrees of external knowledge. A novel modular framework\ndivides the knowledge into four categories according to the depth of knowledge\nthey convey. Each category consists of a set of features automatically\ngenerated from different information sources (such as a knowledge-base, a list\nof names or document-specific semantic annotations) and is used to train a\nconditional random field (CRF). Since those information sources are usually\nmultilingual, KnowNER can be easily trained for a wide range of languages. In\nthis paper, we show that the incorporation of deeper knowledge systematically\nboosts accuracy and compare KnowNER with state-of-the-art NER approaches across\nthree languages (i.e., English, German and Spanish) performing amongst\nstate-of-the art systems in all of them.", "published": "2017-09-11 18:54:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03544v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Social Media Text Processing and Semantic Analysis for Smart Cities", "abstract": "With the rise of Social Media, people obtain and share information almost\ninstantly on a 24/7 basis. Many research areas have tried to gain valuable\ninsights from these large volumes of freely available user generated content.\n  With the goal of extracting knowledge from social media streams that might be\nuseful in the context of intelligent transportation systems and smart cities,\nwe designed and developed a framework that provides functionalities for\nparallel collection of geo-located tweets from multiple pre-defined bounding\nboxes (cities or regions), including filtering of non-complying tweets, text\npre-processing for Portuguese and English language, topic modeling, and\ntransportation-specific text classifiers, as well as, aggregation and data\nvisualization.\n  We performed an exploratory data analysis of geo-located tweets in 5\ndifferent cities: Rio de Janeiro, S\\~ao Paulo, New York City, London and\nMelbourne, comprising a total of more than 43 million tweets in a period of 3\nmonths. Furthermore, we performed a large scale topic modelling comparison\nbetween Rio de Janeiro and S\\~ao Paulo. Interestingly, most of the topics are\nshared between both cities which despite being in the same country are\nconsidered very different regarding population, economy and lifestyle.\n  We take advantage of recent developments in word embeddings and train such\nrepresentations from the collections of geo-located tweets. We then use a\ncombination of bag-of-embeddings and traditional bag-of-words to train\ntravel-related classifiers in both Portuguese and English to filter\ntravel-related content from non-related. We created specific gold-standard data\nto perform empirical evaluation of the resulting classifiers. Results are in\nline with research work in other application areas by showing the robustness of\nusing word embeddings to learn word similarities that bag-of-words is not able\nto capture.", "published": "2017-09-11 14:30:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03406v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
