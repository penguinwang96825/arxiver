{"title": "Multi-Agent Task Allocation in Complementary Teams: A Hunter and Gatherer Approach", "abstract": "Consider a dynamic task allocation problem, where tasks are unknowingly distributed over an environment. This paper considers each task comprised of two sequential subtasks: detection and completion, where each subtask can only be carried out by a certain type of agent. We address this problem using a novel nature-inspired approach called \"hunter and gatherer\". The proposed method employs two complementary teams of agents: one agile in detecting (hunters) and another skillful in completing (gatherers) the tasks. To minimize the collective cost of task accomplishments in a distributed manner, a game-theoretic solution is introduced to couple agents from complementary teams. We utilize market-based negotiation models to develop incentive-based decision-making algorithms relying on innovative notions of \"certainty and uncertainty profit margins\". The simulation results demonstrate that employing two complementary teams of hunters and gatherers can effectually improve the number of tasks completed by agents compared to conventional methods, while the collective cost of accomplishments is minimized. In addition, the stability and efficacy of the proposed solutions are studied using Nash equilibrium analysis and statistical analysis respectively. It is also numerically shown that the proposed solutions function fairly, i.e. for each type of agent, the overall workload is distributed equally.", "published": "2019-12-12 03:13:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05748v2", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Exploration and Coordination of Complementary Multi-Robot Teams in a Hunter and Gatherer Scenario", "abstract": "The hunter and gatherer approach copes with the problem of dynamic multi-robot task allocation, where tasks are unknowingly distributed over an environment. This approach employs two complementary teams of agents: one agile in exploring (hunters) and another dexterous in completing (gatherers) the tasks. Although this approach has been studied from the task planning point of view in our previous works, the multi-robot exploration and coordination aspects of the problem remain uninvestigated. This paper proposes a multi-robot exploration algorithm for hunters based on innovative notions of \"expected information gain\" to minimize the collective cost of task accomplishments in a distributed manner. Besides, we present a coordination solution between hunters and gatherers by integrating the novel notion of profit margins into the concept of expected information gain. Statistical analysis of extensive simulation results confirms the efficacy of the proposed algorithms compared in different environments with varying levels of obstacles complexities. We also demonstrate that the lack of effective coordination between hunters and gatherers significantly hurts the total effectiveness of the planning, especially in environments containing dense obstacles and confined corridors. Finally, it is statistically proven that the overall workload is distributed equally for each type of agent which ensures that the proposed solution is not biased to a particular agent and all agents behave analogously under similar characteristics.", "published": "2019-12-12 03:48:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07521v3", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
