{"title": "Sentiment Classification of Food Reviews", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis of reviews is a popular task in natural language\nprocessing. In this work, the goal is to predict the score of food reviews on a\nscale of 1 to 5 with two recurrent neural networks that are carefully tuned. As\nfor baseline, we train a simple RNN for classification. Then we extend the\nbaseline to GRU. In addition, we present two different methods to deal with\nhighly skewed data, which is a common problem for reviews.

{"title": "Feasibility of Post-Editing Speech Transcriptions with a Mismatched\n  Crowd", "abstract": "Manual correction of speech transcription can involve a selection from\nplausible transcriptions. Recent work has shown the feasibility of employing a\nmismatched crowd for speech transcription. However, it is yet to be established\nwhether a mismatched worker has sufficiently fine-granular speech perception to\nchoose among the phonetically proximate options that are likely to be generated\nfrom the trellis of an ASRU. Hence, we consider five languages, Arabic, German,\nHindi, Russian and Spanish. For each we generate synthetic, phonetically\nproximate, options which emulate post-editing scenarios of varying difficulty.\nWe consistently observe non-trivial crowd ability to choose among fine-granular\noptions.", "published": "2016-09-07 16:05:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02043v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Using Gaussian Processes for Rumour Stance Classification in Social\n  Media", "abstract": "Social media tend to be rife with rumours while new reports are released\npiecemeal during breaking news. Interestingly, one can mine multiple reactions\nexpressed by social media users in those situations, exploring their stance\ntowards rumours, ultimately enabling the flagging of highly disputed rumours as\nbeing potentially false. In this work, we set out to develop an automated,\nsupervised classifier that uses multi-task learning to classify the stance\nexpressed in each individual tweet in a rumourous conversation as either\nsupporting, denying or questioning the rumour. Using a classifier based on\nGaussian Processes, and exploring its effectiveness on two datasets with very\ndifferent characteristics and varying distributions of stances, we show that\nour approach consistently outperforms competitive baseline classifiers. Our\nclassifier is especially effective in estimating the distribution of different\ntypes of stance associated with a given rumour, which we set forth as a desired\ncharacteristic for a rumour-tracking system that will warn both ordinary users\nof Twitter and professional news practitioners when a rumour is being rebutted.", "published": "2016-09-07 12:33:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01962v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Social Dynamics of Language Change in Online Networks", "abstract": "Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of\ncommunication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long\nbeen a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research\nmethods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change\nfrom differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a\ndata set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in\nprogress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social\ninfluence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and \"netspeak\"\nabbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken\nlanguage. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections\nare more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We\nfind that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties\nare significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality\nappears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to\nsupport the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically\nlocal social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.", "published": "2016-09-07 17:09:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02075v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "I.2.7; J.4; J.5"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Ask the GRU: Multi-Task Learning for Deep Text Recommendations", "abstract": "In a variety of application domains the content to be recommended to users is\nassociated with text. This includes research papers, movies with associated\nplot summaries, news articles, blog posts, etc. Recommendation approaches based\non latent factor models can be extended naturally to leverage text by employing\nan explicit mapping from text to factors. This enables recommendations for new,\nunseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are\nproduced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models\nor averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a\nmethod leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence\ninto a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) trained\nend-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific\npaper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In\ncold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which\nignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning,\nwhere the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content\nrecommendation and item metadata prediction. This regularizes the collaborative\nfiltering model, ameliorating the problem of sparsity of the observed rating\nmatrix.", "published": "2016-09-07 19:05:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02116v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "I.2.7; I.2.6"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "A modular architecture for transparent computation in Recurrent Neural\n  Networks", "abstract": "Computation is classically studied in terms of automata, formal languages and\nalgorithms; yet, the relation between neural dynamics and symbolic\nrepresentations and operations is still unclear in traditional eliminative\nconnectionism. Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central\nissue, to which we would like to refer as to transparent connectionism, by\nproposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural\nsubstrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a\nsymbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time\nsimulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of\nversatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems\nevolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear\ndynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping\ndefines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data,\nsymbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in\nactivation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while\nmaintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting\nnetworks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in absence\nof network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture\nand their consequences, we present two examples: i) the design of a Central\nPattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and ii) the\ncreation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports\nthe parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics\nexperiments.", "published": "2016-09-07 10:44:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01926v1", "categories": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.FL", "cs.SC"], "primary_category": "cs.NE"}
