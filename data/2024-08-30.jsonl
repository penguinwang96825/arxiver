{"title": "Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk", "abstract": "The year 2024 witnessed a major development in the cryptocurrency industry\nwith the long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nThis innovation provides investors with a new, regulated path to gain exposure\nto Bitcoin through a familiar investment vehicle (Kumar et al., 2024). However,\nunlike traditional ETFs that directly hold underlying assets, Bitcoin ETFs rely\non a creation and redemption process managed by authorized participants (APs).\nThis unique structure introduces distinct characteristics in terms of\npremium/discount behavior compared to traditional ETFs. This paper investigates\nthe premium and discount patterns observed in Bitcoin ETFs during first\nfour-month period (January 11th, 2024, to May 17th, 2024). Our analysis reveals\nthat these patterns differ significantly from those observed in traditional\nindex ETFs, potentially exposing investors to additional risk factors. By\nidentifying and analyzing these risk factors associated with Bitcoin ETF\npremiums/discounts, this paper aims to achieve two key objectives: Enhance\nmarket understanding: Equip and market and investors with a deeper\ncomprehension of the unique liquidity risks inherent in Bitcoin ETFs. Provide a\nclearer risk management frameworks: Offer a clearer perspective on the\nrisk-return profile of digital asset ETFs, specifically focusing on Bitcoin\nETFs. Through a thorough analysis of premium/discount behavior and the\nunderlying factors contributing to it, this paper strives to contribute\nvaluable insights for investors navigating the evolving landscape of digital\nasset investments", "published": "2024-08-30 21:57:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00270v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
