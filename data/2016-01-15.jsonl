{"title": "Towards Turkish ASR: Anatomy of a rule-based Turkish g2p", "abstract": "This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a rule-based\ngrapheme to phoneme converter for Turkish. The system accepts surface form as\ninput, outputs SAMPA mapping of the all parallel pronounciations according to\nthe morphological analysis together with stress positions. The system has been\nimplemented in Python", "published": "2016-01-15 00:09:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03783v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multimodal Pivots for Image Caption Translation", "abstract": "We present an approach to improve statistical machine translation of image\ndescriptions by multimodal pivots defined in visual space. The key idea is to\nperform image retrieval over a database of images that are captioned in the\ntarget language, and use the captions of the most similar images for\ncrosslingual reranking of translation outputs. Our approach does not depend on\nthe availability of large amounts of in-domain parallel data, but only relies\non available large datasets of monolingually captioned images, and on\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to compute image similarities.\nOur experimental evaluation shows improvements of 1 BLEU point over strong\nbaselines.", "published": "2016-01-15 13:42:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03916v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Detecting and Extracting Events from Text Documents", "abstract": "Events of various kinds are mentioned and discussed in text documents,\nwhether they are books, news articles, blogs or microblog feeds. The paper\nstarts by giving an overview of how events are treated in linguistics and\nphilosophy. We follow this discussion by surveying how events and associated\ninformation are handled in computationally. In particular, we look at how\ntextual documents can be mined to extract events and ancillary information.\nThese days, it is mostly through the application of various machine learning\ntechniques. We also discuss applications of event detection and extraction\nsystems, particularly in summarization, in the medical domain and in the\ncontext of Twitter posts. We end the paper with a discussion of challenges and\nfuture directions.", "published": "2016-01-15 17:33:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04012v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Automatic Description Generation from Images: A Survey of Models,\n  Datasets, and Evaluation Measures", "abstract": "Automatic description generation from natural images is a challenging problem\nthat has recently received a large amount of interest from the computer vision\nand natural language processing communities. In this survey, we classify the\nexisting approaches based on how they conceptualize this problem, viz., models\nthat cast description as either generation problem or as a retrieval problem\nover a visual or multimodal representational space. We provide a detailed\nreview of existing models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.\nMoreover, we give an overview of the benchmark image datasets and the\nevaluation measures that have been developed to assess the quality of\nmachine-generated image descriptions. Finally we extrapolate future directions\nin the area of automatic image description generation.", "published": "2016-01-15 12:50:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03896v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Modification of Question Writing Style Influences Content Popularity in\n  a Social Q&A System", "abstract": "TurboTax AnswerXchange is a social Q&A system supporting users working on\nfederal and state tax returns. Using 2015 data, we demonstrate that content\npopularity (or number of views per AnswerXchange question) can be predicted\nwith reasonable accuracy based on attributes of the question alone. We also\nemploy probabilistic topic analysis and uplift modeling to identify question\nfeatures with the highest impact on popularity. We demonstrate that content\npopularity is driven by behavioral attributes of AnswerXchange users and\ndepends on complex interactions between search ranking algorithms,\npsycholinguistic factors and question writing style. Our findings provide a\nrationale for employing popularity predictions to guide the users into\nformulating better questions and editing the existing ones. For example,\nstarting question title with a question word or adding details to the question\nincrease number of views per question. Similar approach can be applied to\npromoting AnswerXchange content indexed by Google to drive organic traffic to\nTurboTax.", "published": "2016-01-15 21:01:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04075v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
