{"title": "Dependency Recurrent Neural Language Models for Sentence Completion", "abstract": "Recent work on language modelling has shifted focus from count-based models\nto neural models. In these works, the words in each sentence are always\nconsidered in a left-to-right order. In this paper we show how we can improve\nthe performance of the recurrent neural network (RNN) language model by\nincorporating the syntactic dependencies of a sentence, which have the effect\nof bringing relevant contexts closer to the word being predicted. We evaluate\nour approach on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge and show\nthat the dependency RNN proposed improves over the RNN by about 10 points in\naccuracy. Furthermore, we achieve results comparable with the state-of-the-art\nmodels on this task.", "published": "2015-07-05 11:10:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01193v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
