{"title": "Recurrent Stacking of Layers for Compact Neural Machine Translation\n  Models", "abstract": "In neural machine translation (NMT), the most common practice is to stack a\nnumber of recurrent or feed-forward layers in the encoder and the decoder. As a\nresult, the addition of each new layer improves the translation quality\nsignificantly. However, this also leads to a significant increase in the number\nof parameters. In this paper, we propose to share parameters across all the\nlayers thereby leading to a recurrently stacked NMT model. We empirically show\nthat the translation quality of a model that recurrently stacks a single layer\n6 times is comparable to the translation quality of a model that stacks 6\nseparate layers. We also show that using pseudo-parallel corpora by\nback-translation leads to further significant improvements in translation\nquality.", "published": "2018-07-14 08:18:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05353v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generating Synthetic Data for Neural Keyword-to-Question Models", "abstract": "Search typically relies on keyword queries, but these are often semantically\nambiguous. We propose to overcome this by offering users natural language\nquestions, based on their keyword queries, to disambiguate their intent. This\nkeyword-to-question task may be addressed using neural machine translation\ntechniques. Neural translation models, however, require massive amounts of\ntraining data (keyword-question pairs), which is unavailable for this task. The\nmain idea of this paper is to generate large amounts of synthetic training data\nfrom a small seed set of hand-labeled keyword-question pairs. Since natural\nlanguage questions are available in large quantities, we develop models to\nautomatically generate the corresponding keyword queries. Further, we introduce\nvarious filtering mechanisms to ensure that synthetic training data is of high\nquality. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using both automatic\nand manual evaluation.
