{"title": "Microtask crowdsourcing for disease mention annotation in PubMed\n  abstracts", "abstract": "Identifying concepts and relationships in biomedical text enables knowledge\nto be applied in computational analyses. Many biological natural language\nprocess (BioNLP) projects attempt to address this challenge, but the state of\nthe art in BioNLP still leaves much room for improvement. Progress in BioNLP\nresearch depends on large, annotated corpora for evaluating information\nextraction systems and training machine learning models. Traditionally, such\ncorpora are created by small numbers of expert annotators often working over\nextended periods of time. Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask\ncrowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in\naggregate, generate high-quality annotations of biomedical text. Here, we\ninvestigated the use of the AMT in capturing disease mentions in PubMed\nabstracts. We used the NCBI Disease corpus as a gold standard for refining and\nbenchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol. After several iterations, we arrived\nat a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the\ntraining set of this gold standard with an overall F measure of 0.872\n(precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can also be tuned to optimize for\nprecision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or recall (max = 0.980 when\nprecision = 0.436). Each document was examined by 15 workers, and their\nannotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In total 145 workers\ncombined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06\nper abstract per worker. The quality of the annotations, as judged with the F\nmeasure, increases with the number of workers assigned to each task such that\nthe system can be tuned to balance cost against quality. These results\ndemonstrate that microtask crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for generating\nwell-annotated corpora in BioNLP.", "published": "2014-08-08 17:49:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1928v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "9208", "H.5.3; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "A model of grassroots changes in linguistic systems", "abstract": "Linguistic norms emerge in human communities because people imitate each\nother. A shared linguistic system provides people with the benefits of shared\nknowledge and coordinated planning. Once norms are in place, why would they\never change? This question, echoing broad questions in the theory of social\ndynamics, has particular force in relation to language. By definition, an\ninnovator is in the minority when the innovation first occurs. In some areas of\nsocial dynamics, important minorities can strongly influence the majority\nthrough their power, fame, or use of broadcast media. But most linguistic\nchanges are grassroots developments that originate with ordinary people. Here,\nwe develop a novel model of communicative behavior in communities, and identify\na mechanism for arbitrary innovations by ordinary people to have a good chance\nof being widely adopted.\n  To imitate each other, people must form a mental representation of what other\npeople do. Each time they speak, they must also decide which form to produce\nthemselves. We introduce a new decision function that enables us to smoothly\nexplore the space between two types of behavior: probability matching (matching\nthe probabilities of incoming experience) and regularization (producing some\nforms disproportionately often). Using Monte Carlo methods, we explore the\ninteractions amongst the degree of regularization, the distribution of biases\nin a network, and the network position of the innovator. We identify two\nregimes for the widespread adoption of arbritrary innovations, viewed as\ninformational cascades in the network. With moderate regularization of\nexperienced input, average people (not well-connected people) are the most\nlikely source of successful innovations. Our results shed light on a major\noutstanding puzzle in the theory of language change. The framework also holds\npromise for understanding the dynamics of other social norms.", "published": "2014-08-08 21:23:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1985v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "nlin.AO", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
