{"title": "Comparison of the language networks from literature and blogs", "abstract": "In this paper we present the comparison of the linguistic networks from\nliterature and blog texts. The linguistic networks are constructed from texts\nas directed and weighted co-occurrence networks of words. Words are nodes and\nlinks are established between two nodes if they are directly co-occurring\nwithin the sentence. The comparison of the networks structure is performed at\nglobal level (network) in terms of: average node degree, average shortest path\nlength, diameter, clustering coefficient, density and number of components.\nFurthermore, we perform analysis on the local level (node) by comparing the\nrank plots of in and out degree, strength and selectivity. The\nselectivity-based results point out that there are differences between the\nstructure of the networks constructed from literature and blogs.", "published": "2014-05-12 10:46:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2702v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Study of Entanglement in a Categorical Framework of Natural Language", "abstract": "In both quantum mechanics and corpus linguistics based on vector spaces, the\nnotion of entanglement provides a means for the various subsystems to\ncommunicate with each other. In this paper we examine a number of\nimplementations of the categorical framework of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark\n(2010) for natural language, from an entanglement perspective. Specifically,\nour goal is to better understand in what way the level of entanglement of the\nrelational tensors (or the lack of it) affects the compositional structures in\npractical situations. Our findings reveal that a number of proposals for verb\nconstruction lead to almost separable tensors, a fact that considerably\nsimplifies the interactions between the words. We examine the ramifications of\nthis fact, and we show that the use of Frobenius algebras mitigates the\npotential problems to a great extent. Finally, we briefly examine a machine\nlearning method that creates verb tensors exhibiting a sufficient level of\nentanglement.", "published": "2014-05-12 18:48:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2874v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "math.CT", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
