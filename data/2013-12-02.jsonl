{"title": "Bidirectional Recursive Neural Networks for Token-Level Labeling with\n  Structure", "abstract": "Recently, deep architectures, such as recurrent and recursive neural networks\nhave been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks.\nInspired by bidirectional recurrent neural networks which use representations\nthat summarize the past and future around an instance, we propose a novel\narchitecture that aims to capture the structural information around an input,\nand use it to label instances. We apply our method to the task of opinion\nexpression extraction, where we employ the binary parse tree of a sentence as\nthe structure, and word vector representations as the initial representation of\na single token. We conduct preliminary experiments to investigate its\nperformance and compare it to the sequential approach.", "published": "2013-12-02 15:54:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0493v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
