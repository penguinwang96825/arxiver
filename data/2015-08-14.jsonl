{"title": "Reward Shaping with Recurrent Neural Networks for Speeding up On-Line\n  Policy Learning in Spoken Dialogue Systems", "abstract": "Statistical spoken dialogue systems have the attractive property of being\nable to be optimised from data via interactions with real users. However in the\nreinforcement learning paradigm the dialogue manager (agent) often requires\nsignificant time to explore the state-action space to learn to behave in a\ndesirable manner. This is a critical issue when the system is trained on-line\nwith real users where learning costs are expensive. Reward shaping is one\npromising technique for addressing these concerns. Here we examine three\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) approaches for providing reward shaping\ninformation in addition to the primary (task-orientated) environmental\nfeedback. These RNNs are trained on returns from dialogues generated by a\nsimulated user and attempt to diffuse the overall evaluation of the dialogue\nback down to the turn level to guide the agent towards good behaviour faster.\nIn both simulated and real user scenarios these RNNs are shown to increase\npolicy learning speed. Importantly, they do not require prior knowledge of the\nuser's goal.", "published": "2015-08-14 00:41:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03391v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Is Stack Overflow Overflowing With Questions and Tags", "abstract": "Programming question and answer (Q & A) websites, such as Quora, Stack\nOverflow, and Yahoo! Answer etc. helps us to understand the programming\nconcepts easily and quickly in a way that has been tested and applied by many\nsoftware developers. Stack Overflow is one of the most frequently used\nprogramming Q\\&A website where the questions and answers posted are presently\nanalyzed manually, which requires a huge amount of time and resource. To save\nthe effort, we present a topic modeling based technique to analyze the words of\nthe original texts to discover the themes that run through them. We also\npropose a method to automate the process of reviewing the quality of questions\non Stack Overflow dataset in order to avoid ballooning the stack overflow with\ninsignificant questions. The proposed method also recommends the appropriate\ntags for the new post, which averts the creation of unnecessary tags on Stack\nOverflow.", "published": "2015-08-14 18:39:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03601v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "H.5.3; I.2.6; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
