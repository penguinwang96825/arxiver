{"title": "Towards Meaningful Maps of Polish Case Law", "abstract": "In this work, we analyze the utility of two dimensional document maps for\nexploratory analysis of Polish case law. We start by comparing two methods of\ngenerating such visualizations. First is based on linear principal component\nanalysis (PCA). Second makes use of the modern nonlinear t-Distributed\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding method (t-SNE). We apply both PCA and t-SNE to a\ncorpus of judgments from different courts in Poland. It emerges that t-SNE\nprovides better, more interpretable results than PCA. As a next test, we apply\nt-SNE to randomly selected sample of common court judgments corresponding to\ndifferent keywords. We show that t-SNE, in this case, reveals hidden topical\nstructure of the documents related to keyword,,pension\". In conclusion, we find\nthat the t-SNE method could be a promising tool to facilitate the exploitative\nanalysis of legal texts, e.g., by complementing search or browse functionality\nin legal databases.", "published": "2015-10-12 13:52:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03421v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
