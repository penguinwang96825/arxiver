{"title": "Extracting a bilingual semantic grammar from FrameNet-annotated corpora", "abstract": "We present the creation of an English-Swedish FrameNet-based grammar in\nGrammatical Framework. The aim of this research is to make existing framenets\ncomputationally accessible for multilingual natural language applications via a\ncommon semantic grammar API, and to facilitate the porting of such grammar to\nother languages. In this paper, we describe the abstract syntax of the semantic\ngrammar while focusing on its automatic extraction possibilities. We have\nextracted a shared abstract syntax from ~58,500 annotated sentences in Berkeley\nFrameNet (BFN) and ~3,500 annotated sentences in Swedish FrameNet (SweFN). The\nabstract syntax defines 769 frame-specific valence patterns that cover 77.8%\nexamples in BFN and 74.9% in SweFN belonging to the shared set of 471 frames.\nAs a side result, we provide a unified method for comparing semantic and\nsyntactic valence patterns across framenets.", "published": "2014-04-08 10:08:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2071v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences", "abstract": "The ability to accurately represent sentences is central to language\nunderstanding. We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic\nConvolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of\nsentences. The network uses Dynamic k-Max Pooling, a global pooling operation\nover linear sequences. The network handles input sentences of varying length\nand induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly\ncapturing short and long-range relations. The network does not rely on a parse\ntree and is easily applicable to any language. We test the DCNN in four\nexperiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way\nquestion classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant\nsupervision. The network achieves excellent performance in the first three\ntasks and a greater than 25% error reduction in the last task with respect to\nthe strongest baseline.", "published": "2014-04-08 15:46:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2188v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Aspect-Based Opinion Extraction from Customer reviews", "abstract": "Text is the main method of communicating information in the digital age.\nMessages, blogs, news articles, reviews, and opinionated information abound on\nthe Internet. People commonly purchase products online and post their opinions\nabout purchased items. This feedback is displayed publicly to assist others\nwith their purchasing decisions, creating the need for a mechanism with which\nto extract and summarize useful information for enhancing the decision-making\nprocess. Our contribution is to improve the accuracy of extraction by combining\ndifferent techniques from three major areas, named Data Mining, Natural\nLanguage Processing techniques and Ontologies. The proposed framework\nsequentially mines products aspects and users opinions, groups representative\naspects by similarity, and generates an output summary. This paper focuses on\nthe task of extracting product aspects and users opinions by extracting all\npossible aspects and opinions from reviews using natural language, ontology,\nand frequent (tag) sets. The proposed framework, when compared with an existing\nbaseline model, yielded promising results.", "published": "2014-04-08 01:19:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1982v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
