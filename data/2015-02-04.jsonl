{"title": "Authorship recognition via fluctuation analysis of network topology and\n  word intermittency", "abstract": "Statistical methods have been widely employed in many practical natural\nlanguage processing applications. More specifically, complex networks concepts\nand methods from dynamical systems theory have been successfully applied to\nrecognize stylistic patterns in written texts. Despite the large amount of\nstudies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a few studies\nhave assessed the relevance of attributes derived from the analysis of\nstylistic fluctuations. Because fluctuations represent a pivotal factor for\ncharacterizing a myriad of real systems, this study focused on the analysis of\nthe properties of stylistic fluctuations in texts via topological analysis of\ncomplex networks and intermittency measurements. The results showed that\ndifferent authors display distinct fluctuation patterns. In particular, it was\nfound that it is possible to identify the authorship of books using the\nintermittency of specific words. Taken together, the results described here\nsuggest that the patterns found in stylistic fluctuations could be used to\nanalyze other related complex systems. Furthermore, the discovery of novel\npatterns related to textual stylistic fluctuations indicates that these\npatterns could be useful to improve the state of the art of many\nstylistic-based natural language processing tasks.", "published": "2015-02-04 16:12:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01245v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
