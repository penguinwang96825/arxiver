{"title": "Path of Vowel Raising in Chengdu Dialect of Mandarin", "abstract": "He and Rao (2013) reported a raising phenomenon of /a/ in /Xan/ (X being a\nconsonant or a vowel) in Chengdu dialect of Mandarin, i.e. /a/ is realized as\n[epsilon] for young speakers but [ae] for older speakers, but they offered no\nacoustic analysis. We designed an acoustic study that examined the realization\nof /Xan/ in speakers of different age (old vs. young) and gender (male vs.\nfemale) groups, where X represents three conditions: 1) unaspirated consonants:\nC ([p], [t], [k]), 2) aspirated consonants: Ch ([ph], [th], [kh]), and 3) high\nvowels: V ([i], [y], [u]). 17 native speakers were asked to read /Xan/\ncharacters and the F1 values are extracted for comparison. Our results\nconfirmed the raising effect in He and Rao (2013), i.e., young speakers realize\n/a/ as [epsilon] in /an/, whereas older speakers in the most part realize it as\n[ae]. Also, female speakers raise more than male speakers within the same age\ngroup. Interestingly, within the /Van/ condition, older speakers do raise /a/\nin /ian/ and /yan/. We interpret this as /a/ first assimilates to its preceding\nfront high vowels /i/ and /y/ for older speakers, which then becomes\nphonologized in younger speakers in all conditions, including /Chan/ and /Can/.\nThis shows a possible trajectory of the ongoing sound change in the Chengdu\ndialect.", "published": "2018-03-11 02:58:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03887v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generating Bilingual Pragmatic Color References", "abstract": "Contextual influences on language often exhibit substantial cross-lingual\nregularities; for example, we are more verbose in situations that require finer\ndistinctions. However, these regularities are sometimes obscured by semantic\nand syntactic differences. Using a newly-collected dataset of color reference\ngames in Mandarin Chinese (which we release to the public), we confirm that a\nvariety of constructions display the same sensitivity to contextual difficulty\nin Chinese and English. We then show that a neural speaker agent trained on\nbilingual data with a simple multitask learning approach displays more\nhuman-like patterns of context dependence and is more pragmatically informative\nthan its monolingual Chinese counterpart. Moreover, this is not at the expense\nof language-specific semantic understanding: the resulting speaker model learns\nthe different basic color term systems of English and Chinese (with noteworthy\ncross-lingual influences), and it can identify synonyms between the two\nlanguages using vector analogy operations on its output layer, despite having\nno exposure to parallel data.", "published": "2018-03-11 07:05:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03917v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Preparing Bengali-English Code-Mixed Corpus for Sentiment Analysis of\n  Indian Languages", "abstract": "Analysis of informative contents and sentiments of social users has been\nattempted quite intensively in the recent past. Most of the systems are usable\nonly for monolingual data and fails or gives poor results when used on data\nwith code-mixing property. To gather attention and encourage researchers to\nwork on this crisis, we prepared gold standard Bengali-English code-mixed data\nwith language and polarity tag for sentiment analysis purposes. In this paper,\nwe discuss the systems we prepared to collect and filter raw Twitter data. In\norder to reduce manual work while annotation, hybrid systems combining rule\nbased and supervised models were developed for both language and sentiment\ntagging. The final corpus was annotated by a group of annotators following a\nfew guidelines. The gold standard corpus thus obtained has impressive\ninter-annotator agreement obtained in terms of Kappa values. Various metrics\nlike Code-Mixed Index (CMI), Code-Mixed Factor (CF) along with various aspects\n(language and emotion) also qualitatively polled the code-mixed and sentiment\nproperties of the corpus.", "published": "2018-03-11 18:13:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04000v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Modeling Singing F0 With Neural Network Driven Transition-Sustain Models", "abstract": "This study focuses on generating fundamental frequency (F0) curves of singing\nvoice from musical scores stored in a midi-like notation. Current statistical\nparametric approaches to singing F0 modeling meet difficulties in reproducing\nvibratos and the temporal details at note boundaries due to the oversmoothing\ntendency of statistical models. This paper presents a neural network based\nsolution that models a pair of neighboring notes at a time (the transition\nmodel) and uses a separate network for generating vibratos (the sustain model).\nPredictions from the two models are combined by summation after proper\nenveloping to enforce continuity. In the training phase, mild misalignment\nbetween the scores and the target F0 is addressed by back-propagating the\ngradients to the networks' inputs. Subjective listening tests on the NITech\nsinging database show that transition-sustain models are able to generate F0\ntrajectories close to the original performance.", "published": "2018-03-11 19:55:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04030v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Optimal Data-based Kernel Estimation of Evolutionary Spectra", "abstract": "Complex demodulation of evolutionary spectra is formulated as a\ntwo-dimensional kernel smoother in the time-frequency domain. In the first\nstage, a tapered Fourier transform, $y_{nu}(f,t)$, is calculated. Second, the\nlog-spectral estimate, $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\nu}(f,t) \\equiv \\ln(|y_{nu}(f,t)|^2$, is\nsmoothed. As the characteristic widths of the kernel smoother increase, the\nbias from temporal and frequency averaging increases while the variance\ndecreases. The demodulation parameters, such as the order, length, and\nbandwidth of spectral taper and the kernel smoother, are determined by\nminimizing the expected error. For well-resolved evolutionary spectra, the\noptimal taper length is a small fraction of the optimal kernel half-width. The\noptimal frequency bandwidth, $w$, for the spectral window scales as $w^2\n\\approx \\lambda_F/ \\tau $, where $\\tau$ is the characteristic time, and\n$\\lambda_F$ is the characteristic frequency scale-length. In contrast, the\noptimal half-widths for the second stage kernel smoother scales as $h \\approx\n1/(\\tau \\lambda_F)^{1 \\over ( p+2) }$, where $p$ is the order of the kernel\nsmoother. The ratio of the optimal frequency half-width to the optimal time\nhalf-width satisfies $h_F / h_T ~ (|\\partial_t ^p \\theta | / |\\partial_f^p\n\\theta|)$. Since the expected loss depends on the unknown evolutionary spectra,\nwe initially estimate $|\\partial_t^p \\theta|^2$ and $|\\partial_f^p \\theta|^2$\nusing a higher order kernel smoothers, and then substitute the estimated\nderivatives into the expected loss criteria.", "published": "2018-03-11 04:21:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03897v1", "categories": ["stat.ME", "eess.AS", "eess.IV", "eess.SP", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "stat.ME"}
