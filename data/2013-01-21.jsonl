{"title": "A type theoretical framework for natural language semantics: the\n  Montagovian generative lexicon", "abstract": "We present a framework, named the Montagovian generative lexicon, for\ncomputing the semantics of natural language sentences, expressed in many sorted\nhigher order logic. Word meaning is depicted by lambda terms of second order\nlambda calculus (Girard's system F) with base types including a type for\npropositions and many types for sorts of a many sorted logic. This framework is\nable to integrate a proper treatment of lexical phenomena into a Montagovian\ncompositional semantics, including the restriction of selection which imposes\nthe nature of the arguments of a predicate, and the possible adaptation of a\nword meaning to some contexts. Among these adaptations of a word's sense to the\ncontext, ontological inclusions are handled by an extension of system F with\ncoercive subtyping that is introduced in the present paper. The benefits of\nthis framework for lexical pragmatics are illustrated on meaning transfers and\ncoercions, on possible and impossible copredication over different senses, on\ndeverbal ambiguities, and on \"fictive motion\". Next we show that the\ncompositional treatment of determiners, quantifiers, plurals,... are finer\ngrained in our framework. We then conclude with the linguistic, logical and\ncomputational perspectives opened by the Montagovian generative lexicon.", "published": "2013-01-21 17:42:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v3", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LO"}
