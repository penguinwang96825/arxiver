However, a key\nlimitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router,\nwhich prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model.\nTo overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router\nframework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the\nrouter by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity\nbetween the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,\nwhich are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the\noutput norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby\nenabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further\nsharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard\nMoE activation patterns.

As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and\na long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with\ndiverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large\nviewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and\nreference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely\non 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification\nframework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D\nreasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the\nfirst stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for\ngenerating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then\nestimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,\npreventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When\ninvoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a\n3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a\nkeypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences\nbetween query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity\nscoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior\nstate of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,\navoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.

A\ndownstream proxy-task model evaluates the reconstructed signal, with its task\nloss supervising the selector in a collaborative optimization scheme that\nrelies solely on task labels, eliminating the need for clean EEG references.\nExperiments on three datasets spanning two paradigms and multiple noise\nconditions show consistent gains in both task performance (accuracy:\n$2.56\\%\\uparrow$) and standard signal-quality metrics (signal-to-noise-ratio:\n$0.82$\\,dB\\,$\\uparrow$). Further analyses demonstrate that the task-oriented\nlearning framework is algorithm-agnostic, as it accommodates diverse\ndecomposition techniques and network backbones for both the selector and the\nproxy model. These promising results indicate that the proposed task-oriented\nlearning framework is a practical EEG denoising solution with potential\nimplications for neuroscience research and EEG-based interaction systems.", "published": "2025-09-18 06:45:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14665v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Chameleon: Integrated Sensing and Communication with Sub-Symbol Beam Switching in mmWave Networks", "abstract": "Next-generation cellular networks are envisioned to integrate sensing\ncapabilities with communication, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nspectrum, where beamforming using large-scale antenna arrays enables\ndirectional signal transmissions for improved spatial multiplexing. In current\n5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for\ncommunication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In\nthis paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly\nswitches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to\nachieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each\nbeamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while\nmaintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement\nChameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G\nphysical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments\nin open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with\na sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon\nemploys a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\\mu}s, therefore\nproducing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine\nlearning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of\n0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\\deg} (angle), and material classification with\n99.0% accuracy.", "published": "2025-09-18 05:14:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14628v1", "categories": ["cs.NI", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.NI"}

{"title": "Age of Information Aided Intelligent Grant-Free Massive Access for Heterogeneous mMTC Traffic", "abstract": "With the arrival of 6G, the Internet of Things (IoT) traffic is becoming more\nand more complex and diverse. To meet the diverse service requirements of IoT\ndevices, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) becomes a typical scenario,\nand more recently, grant-free random access (GF-RA) presents a promising\ndirection due to its low signaling overhead. However, existing GF-RA research\nprimarily focuses on improving the accuracy of user detection and data\nrecovery, without considering the heterogeneity of traffic. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a non-orthogonal GF-RA scenario where two distinct types of traffic\ncoexist: event-triggered traffic with alarm devices (ADs), and status update\ntraffic with monitor devices (MDs). The goal is to simultaneously achieve high\ndetection success rates for ADs and high information timeliness for MDs. First,\nwe analyze the age-based random access scheme and optimize the access\nparameters to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of MDs. Then, we\ndesign an age-based prior information aided autoencoder (A-PIAAE) to jointly\ndetect active devices, together with learned pilots used in GF-RA to reduce\ninterference between non-orthogonal pilots. In the decoder, an Age-based\nLearned Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA-AGE) utilizing the\nAoI of MDs as the prior information is proposed to enhance active user\ndetection. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the proposed A-PIAAE\nhas better convergence performance. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of\nthe proposed method in reducing the average AoI of MDs and improving the\nsuccessful detection rate of ADs.", "published": "2025-09-18 00:33:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14503v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
