{"title": "Artificial Intelligence, speech and language processing approaches to monitoring Alzheimer's Disease: a systematic review", "abstract": "Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer's Disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis. This paper summarises current findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer's Disease, detailing current research procedures, highlighting their limitations and suggesting strategies to address them. We conducted a systematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase) and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019. From 3,654 search results 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarise their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods and outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation and results) and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias and strengths/limitations). While promising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. We concluded that the main limitations of the field are poor standardisation, limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications. Attempts to close these gaps should support translation of future research into clinical practice.", "published": "2020-10-12 21:43:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06047v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Privacy-Preserving Distributed Projection LMS for Linear Multitask Networks", "abstract": "We develop a privacy-preserving distributed projection least mean squares (LMS) strategy over linear multitask networks, where agents' local parameters of interest or tasks are linearly related. Each agent is interested in not only improving its local inference performance via in-network cooperation with neighboring agents, but also protecting its own individual task against privacy leakage. In our proposed strategy, at each time instant, each agent sends a noisy estimate, which is its local intermediate estimate corrupted by a zero-mean additive noise, to its neighboring agents. We derive a sufficient condition to determine the amount of noise to add to each agent's intermediate estimate to achieve an optimal trade-off between the network mean-square-deviation and an inference privacy constraint. We propose a distributed and adaptive strategy to compute the additive noise powers, and study the mean and mean-square behaviors and privacy-preserving performance of the proposed strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that our strategy is able to balance the trade-off between estimation accuracy and privacy preservation.", "published": "2020-10-12 08:31:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05527v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
