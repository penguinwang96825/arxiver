{"title": "Text to Multi-level MindMaps: A Novel Method for Hierarchical Visual\n  Abstraction of Natural Language Text", "abstract": "MindMapping is a well-known technique used in note taking, which encourages\nlearning and studying. MindMapping has been manually adopted to help present\nknowledge and concepts in a visual form. Unfortunately, there is no reliable\nautomated approach to generate MindMaps from Natural Language text. This work\nfirstly introduces MindMap Multilevel Visualization concept which is to jointly\nvisualize and summarize textual information. The visualization is achieved\npictorially across multiple levels using semantic information (i.e. ontology),\nwhile the summarization is achieved by the information in the highest levels as\nthey represent abstract information in the text. This work also presents the\nfirst automated approach that takes a text input and generates a MindMap\nvisualization out of it. The approach could visualize text documents in\nmultilevel MindMaps, in which a high-level MindMap node could be expanded into\nchild MindMaps. \\ignore{ As far as we know, this is the first work that view\nMindMapping as a new approach to jointly summarize and visualize textual\ninformation.} The proposed method involves understanding of the input text and\nconverting it into intermediate Detailed Meaning Representation (DMR). The DMR\nis then visualized with two modes; Single level or Multiple levels, which is\nconvenient for larger text. The generated MindMaps from both approaches were\nevaluated based on Human Subject experiments performed on Amazon Mechanical\nTurk with various parameter settings.", "published": "2014-08-01 03:18:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1031v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
