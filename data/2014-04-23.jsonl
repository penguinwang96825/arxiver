{"title": "An Account of Opinion Implicatures", "abstract": "While previous sentiment analysis research has concentrated on the\ninterpretation of explicitly stated opinions and attitudes, this work initiates\nthe computational study of a type of opinion implicature (i.e.,\nopinion-oriented inference) in text. This paper described a rule-based\nframework for representing and analyzing opinion implicatures which we hope\nwill contribute to deeper automatic interpretation of subjective language. In\nthe course of understanding implicatures, the system recognizes implicit\nsentiments (and beliefs) toward various events and entities in the sentence,\noften attributed to different sources (holders) and of mixed polarities; thus,\nit produces a richer interpretation than is typical in opinion analysis.", "published": "2014-04-23 19:28:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6491v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
