{"title": "A Secure and Comparable Text Encryption Algorithm", "abstract": "This paper discloses a simple algorithm for encrypting text messages, based\non the NP-completeness of the subset sum problem, such that the similarity\nbetween encryptions is roughly proportional to the semantic similarity between\ntheir generating messages. This allows parties to compare encrypted messages\nfor semantic overlap without trusting an intermediary and might be applied, for\nexample, as a means of finding scientific collaborators over the Internet.", "published": "2013-08-15 02:44:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3294v1", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}
