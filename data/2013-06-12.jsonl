{"title": "The Quantum Challenge in Concept Theory and Natural Language Processing", "abstract": "The mathematical formalism of quantum theory has been successfully used in\nhuman cognition to model decision processes and to deliver representations of\nhuman knowledge. As such, quantum cognition inspired tools have improved\ntechnologies for Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. In this\npaper, we overview the quantum cognition approach developed in our Brussels\nteam during the last two decades, specifically our identification of quantum\nstructures in human concepts and language, and the modeling of data from\npsychological and corpus-text-based experiments. We discuss our\nquantum-theoretic framework for concepts and their conjunctions/disjunctions in\na Fock-Hilbert space structure, adequately modeling a large amount of data\ncollected on concept combinations. Inspired by this modeling, we put forward\nelements for a quantum contextual and meaning-based approach to information\ntechnologies in which 'entities of meaning' are inversely reconstructed from\ntexts, which are considered as traces of these entities' states.", "published": "2013-06-12 14:35:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2838v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
