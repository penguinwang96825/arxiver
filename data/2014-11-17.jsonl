{"title": "Opinion mining of text documents written in Macedonian language", "abstract": "The ability to extract public opinion from web portals such as review sites,\nsocial networks and blogs will enable companies and individuals to form a view,\nan attitude and make decisions without having to do lengthy and costly\nresearches and surveys. In this paper machine learning techniques are used for\ndetermining the polarity of forum posts on kajgana which are written in\nMacedonian language. The posts are classified as being positive, negative or\nneutral. We test different feature metrics and classifiers and provide detailed\nevaluation of their participation in improving the overall performance on a\nmanually generated dataset. By achieving 92% accuracy, we show that the\nperformance of systems for automated opinion mining is comparable to a human\nevaluator, thus making it a viable option for text data analysis. Finally, we\npresent a few statistics derived from the forum posts using the developed\nsystem.", "published": "2014-11-17 13:36:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4472v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Errata: Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction with Matrix\n  Completion", "abstract": "The essence of distantly supervised relation extraction is that it is an\nincomplete multi-label classification problem with sparse and noisy features.\nTo tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the\nclassification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of\nminimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown\nlabels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates\ntraining and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic\nframework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and\nitem-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover\nthe underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix.\nThe matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation\n(FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely\nused datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that\nour low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline\nand the state-of-the-art methods.", "published": "2014-11-17 12:43:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4455v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Relations World: A Possibilistic Graphical Model", "abstract": "We explore the idea of using a \"possibilistic graphical model\" as the basis\nfor a world model that drives a dialog system. As a first step we have\ndeveloped a system that uses text-based dialog to derive a model of the user's\nfamily relations. The system leverages its world model to infer relational\ntriples, to learn to recover from upstream coreference resolution errors and\nambiguities, and to learn context-dependent paraphrase models. We also explore\nsome theoretical aspects of the underlying graphical model.", "published": "2014-11-17 20:15:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4618v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
