{"title": "Dissecting a Social Botnet: Growth, Content and Influence in Twitter", "abstract": "Social botnets have become an important phenomenon on social media. There are\nmany ways in which social bots can disrupt or influence online discourse, such\nas, spam hashtags, scam twitter users, and astroturfing. In this paper we\nconsidered one specific social botnet in Twitter to understand how it grows\nover time, how the content of tweets by the social botnet differ from regular\nusers in the same dataset, and lastly, how the social botnet may have\ninfluenced the relevant discussions. Our analysis is based on a qualitative\ncoding for approximately 3000 tweets in Arabic and English from the Syrian\nsocial bot that was active for 35 weeks on Twitter before it was shutdown. We\nfind that the growth, behavior and content of this particular botnet did not\nspecifically align with common conceptions of botnets. Further we identify\ninteresting aspects of the botnet that distinguish it from regular users.", "published": "2016-04-13 01:00:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03627v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Visual Storytelling", "abstract": "We introduce the first dataset for sequential vision-to-language, and explore\nhow this data may be used for the task of visual storytelling. The first\nrelease of this dataset, SIND v.1, includes 81,743 unique photos in 20,211\nsequences, aligned to both descriptive (caption) and story language. We\nestablish several strong baselines for the storytelling task, and motivate an\nautomatic metric to benchmark progress. Modelling concrete description as well\nas figurative and social language, as provided in this dataset and the\nstorytelling task, has the potential to move artificial intelligence from basic\nunderstandings of typical visual scenes towards more and more human-like\nunderstanding of grounded event structure and subjective expression.", "published": "2016-04-13 20:27:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03968v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
