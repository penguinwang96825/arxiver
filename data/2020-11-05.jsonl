{"title": "Multi-Accent Adaptation based on Gate Mechanism", "abstract": "When only a limited amount of accented speech data is available, to promote multi-accent speech recognition performance, the conventional approach is accent-specific adaptation, which adapts the baseline model to multiple target accents independently. To simplify the adaptation procedure, we explore adapting the baseline model to multiple target accents simultaneously with multi-accent mixed data. Thus, we propose using accent-specific top layer with gate mechanism (AST-G) to realize multi-accent adaptation. Compared with the baseline model and accent-specific adaptation, AST-G achieves 9.8% and 1.9% average relative WER reduction respectively. However, in real-world applications, we can't obtain the accent category label for inference in advance. Therefore, we apply using an accent classifier to predict the accent label. To jointly train the acoustic model and the accent classifier, we propose the multi-task learning with gate mechanism (MTL-G). As the accent label prediction could be inaccurate, it performs worse than the accent-specific adaptation. Yet, in comparison with the baseline model, MTL-G achieves 5.1% average relative WER reduction.", "published": "2020-11-05 11:58:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02774v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Exploring End-to-End Multi-channel ASR with Bias Information for Meeting Transcription", "abstract": "Joint optimization of multi-channel front-end and automatic speech recognition (ASR) has attracted much interest. While promising results have been reported for various tasks, past studies on its meeting transcription application were limited to small scale experiments. It is still unclear whether such a joint framework can be beneficial for a more practical setup where a massive amount of single channel training data can be leveraged for building a strong ASR back-end. In this work, we present our investigation on the joint modeling of a mask-based beamformer and Attention-Encoder-Decoder-based ASR in the setting where we have 75k hours of single-channel data and a relatively small amount of real multi-channel data for model training. We explore effective training procedures, including a comparison of simulated and real multi-channel training data. To guide the recognition towards a target speaker and deal with overlapped speech, we also explore various combinations of bias information, such as direction of arrivals and speaker profiles. We propose an effective location bias integration method called deep concatenation for the beamformer network. In our evaluation on various meeting recordings, we show that the proposed framework achieves a substantial word error rate reduction.", "published": "2020-11-05 21:47:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03110v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
