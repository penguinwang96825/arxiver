{"title": "Clustering Words by Projection Entropy", "abstract": "We apply entropy agglomeration (EA), a recently introduced algorithm, to\ncluster the words of a literary text. EA is a greedy agglomerative procedure\nthat minimizes projection entropy (PE), a function that can quantify the\nsegmentedness of an element set. To apply it, the text is reduced to a feature\nallocation, a combinatorial object to represent the word occurences in the\ntext's paragraphs. The experiment results demonstrate that EA, despite its\nreduction and simplicity, is useful in capturing significant relationships\namong the words in the text. This procedure was implemented in Python and\npublished as a free software: REBUS.", "published": "2014-10-24 20:34:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6830v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
