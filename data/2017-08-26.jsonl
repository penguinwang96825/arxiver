{"title": "Machine Translation in Indian Languages: Challenges and Resolution", "abstract": "English to Indian language machine translation poses the challenge of\nstructural and morphological divergence. This paper describes English to Indian\nlanguage statistical machine translation using pre-ordering and suffix\nseparation. The pre-ordering uses rules to transfer the structure of the source\nsentences prior to training and translation. This syntactic restructuring helps\nstatistical machine translation to tackle the structural divergence and hence\nbetter translation quality. The suffix separation is used to tackle the\nmorphological divergence between English and highly agglutinative Indian\nlanguages. We demonstrate that the use of pre-ordering and suffix separation\nhelps in improving the quality of English to Indian Language machine\ntranslation.", "published": "2017-08-26 08:12:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07950v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Robust Task Clustering for Deep Many-Task Learning", "abstract": "We investigate task clustering for deep-learning based multi-task and\nfew-shot learning in a many-task setting. We propose a new method to measure\ntask similarities with cross-task transfer performance matrix for the deep\nlearning scenario. Although this matrix provides us critical information\nregarding similarity between tasks, its asymmetric property and unreliable\nperformance scores can affect conventional clustering methods adversely.\nAdditionally, the uncertain task-pairs, i.e., the ones with extremely\nasymmetric transfer scores, may collectively mislead clustering algorithms to\noutput an inaccurate task-partition. To overcome these limitations, we propose\na novel task-clustering algorithm by using the matrix completion technique. The\nproposed algorithm constructs a partially-observed similarity matrix based on\nthe certainty of cluster membership of the task-pairs. We then use a matrix\ncompletion algorithm to complete the similarity matrix. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows that under mild constraints, the proposed algorithm will\nperfectly recover the underlying \"true\" similarity matrix with a high\nprobability. Our results show that the new task clustering method can discover\ntask clusters for training flexible and superior neural network models in a\nmulti-task learning setup for sentiment classification and dialog intent\nclassification tasks. Our task clustering approach also extends metric-based\nfew-shot learning methods to adapt multiple metrics, which demonstrates\nempirical advantages when the tasks are diverse.", "published": "2017-08-26 02:29:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07918v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
