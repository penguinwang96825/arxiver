{"title": "Learn to Talk via Proactive Knowledge Transfer", "abstract": "Knowledge Transfer has been applied in solving a wide variety of problems. For example, knowledge can be transferred between tasks (e.g., learning to handle novel situations by leveraging prior knowledge) or between agents (e.g., learning from others without direct experience). Without loss of generality, we relate knowledge transfer to KL-divergence minimization, i.e., matching the (belief) distributions of learners and teachers. The equivalence gives us a new perspective in understanding variants of the KL-divergence by looking at how learners structure their interaction with teachers in order to acquire knowledge. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of KL-divergence minimization in Forward and Backward orders, which shows that learners are reinforced via on-policy learning in Backward. In contrast, learners are supervised in Forward. Moreover, our analysis is gradient-based, so it can be generalized to arbitrary tasks and help to decide which order to minimize given the property of the task. By replacing Forward with Backward in Knowledge Distillation, we observed +0.7-1.1 BLEU gains on the WMT'17 De-En and IWSLT'15 Th-En machine translation tasks.", "published": "2020-08-23 17:46:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10077v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "They are wearing a mask! Identification of Subjects Wearing a Surgical Mask from their Speech by means of x-vectors and Fisher Vectors", "abstract": "Challenges based on Computational Paralinguistics in the INTERSPEECH Conference have always had a good reception among the attendees owing to its competitive academic and research demands. This year, the INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge offers three different problems; here, the Mask Sub-Challenge is of specific interest. This challenge involves the classification of speech recorded from subjects while wearing a surgical mask. In this study, to address the above-mentioned problem we employ two different types of feature extraction methods. The x-vectors embeddings, which is the current state-of-the-art approach for Speaker Recognition; and the Fisher Vector (FV), that is a method originally intended for Image Recognition, but here we utilize it to discriminate utterances. These approaches employ distinct frame-level representations: MFCC and PLP. Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the classifier, we perform a technical comparison between the performances of the FV encodings and the x-vector embeddings for this particular classification task. We find that the Fisher vector encodings provide better representations of the utterances than the x-vectors do for this specific dataset. Moreover, we show that a fusion of our best configurations outperforms all the baseline scores of the Mask Sub-Challenge.", "published": "2020-08-23 11:27:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10014v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
