{"title": "Controlling Linguistic Style Aspects in Neural Language Generation", "abstract": "Most work on neural natural language generation (NNLG) focus on controlling\nthe content of the generated text. We experiment with controlling several\nstylistic aspects of the generated text, in addition to its content. The method\nis based on conditioned RNN language model, where the desired content as well\nas the stylistic parameters serve as conditioning contexts. We demonstrate the\napproach on the movie reviews domain and show that it is successful in\ngenerating coherent sentences corresponding to the required linguistic style\nand content.", "published": "2017-07-09 20:21:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02633v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Neural Machine Translation between Herbal Prescriptions and Diseases", "abstract": "The current study applies deep learning to herbalism. Toward the goal, we\nacquired the de-identified health insurance reimbursements that were claimed in\na 10-year period from 2004 to 2013 in the National Health Insurance Database of\nTaiwan, the total number of reimbursement records equaling 340 millions. Two\nartificial intelligence techniques were applied to the dataset: residual\nconvolutional neural network multitask classifier and attention-based recurrent\nneural network. The former works to translate from herbal prescriptions to\ndiseases; and the latter from diseases to herbal prescriptions. Analysis of the\nclassification results indicates that herbal prescriptions are specific to:\nanatomy, pathophysiology, sex and age of the patient, and season and year of\nthe prescription. Further analysis identifies temperature and gross domestic\nproduct as the meteorological and socioeconomic factors that are associated\nwith herbal prescriptions. Analysis of the neural machine transitional result\nindicates that the recurrent neural network learnt not only syntax but also\nsemantics of diseases and herbal prescriptions.", "published": "2017-07-09 12:51:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02575v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "PELESent: Cross-domain polarity classification using distant supervision", "abstract": "The enormous amount of texts published daily by Internet users has fostered\nthe development of methods to analyze this content in several natural language\nprocessing areas, such as sentiment analysis. The main goal of this task is to\nclassify the polarity of a message. Even though many approaches have been\nproposed for sentiment analysis, some of the most successful ones rely on the\navailability of large annotated corpus, which is an expensive and\ntime-consuming process. In recent years, distant supervision has been used to\nobtain larger datasets. So, inspired by these techniques, in this paper we\nextend such approaches to incorporate popular graphic symbols used in\nelectronic messages, the emojis, in order to create a large sentiment corpus\nfor Portuguese. Trained on almost one million tweets, several models were\ntested in both same domain and cross-domain corpora. Our methods obtained very\ncompetitive results in five annotated corpora from mixed domains (Twitter and\nproduct reviews), which proves the domain-independent property of such\napproach. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of emoticons\nand emojis is able to properly capture the sentiment of a message.", "published": "2017-07-09 23:13:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02657v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
