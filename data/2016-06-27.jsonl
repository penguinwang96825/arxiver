{"title": "Predicting the Relative Difficulty of Single Sentences With and Without\n  Surrounding Context", "abstract": "The problem of accurately predicting relative reading difficulty across a set\nof sentences arises in a number of important natural language applications,\nsuch as finding and curating effective usage examples for intelligent language\ntutoring systems. Yet while significant research has explored document- and\npassage-level reading difficulty, the special challenges involved in assessing\naspects of readability for single sentences have received much less attention,\nparticularly when considering the role of surrounding passages. We introduce\nand evaluate a novel approach for estimating the relative reading difficulty of\na set of sentences, with and without surrounding context. Using different sets\nof lexical and grammatical features, we explore models for predicting pairwise\nrelative difficulty using logistic regression, and examine rankings generated\nby aggregating pairwise difficulty labels using a Bayesian rating system to\nform a final ranking. We also compare rankings derived for sentences assessed\nwith and without context, and find that contextual features can help predict\ndifferences in relative difficulty judgments across these two conditions.", "published": "2016-06-27 19:48:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08425v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Network-Efficient Distributed Word2vec Training System for Large\n  Vocabularies", "abstract": "Word2vec is a popular family of algorithms for unsupervised training of dense\nvector representations of words on large text corpuses. The resulting vectors\nhave been shown to capture semantic relationships among their corresponding\nwords, and have shown promise in reducing a number of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks to mathematical operations on these vectors. While\nheretofore applications of word2vec have centered around vocabularies with a\nfew million words, wherein the vocabulary is the set of words for which vectors\nare simultaneously trained, novel applications are emerging in areas outside of\nNLP with vocabularies comprising several 100 million words. Existing word2vec\ntraining systems are impractical for training such large vocabularies as they\neither require that the vectors of all vocabulary words be stored in the memory\nof a single server or suffer unacceptable training latency due to massive\nnetwork data transfer. In this paper, we present a novel distributed, parallel\ntraining system that enables unprecedented practical training of vectors for\nvocabularies with several 100 million words on a shared cluster of commodity\nservers, using far less network traffic than the existing solutions. We\nevaluate the proposed system on a benchmark dataset, showing that the quality\nof vectors does not degrade relative to non-distributed training. Finally, for\nseveral quarters, the system has been deployed for the purpose of matching\nqueries to ads in Gemini, the sponsored search advertising platform at Yahoo,\nresulting in significant improvement of business metrics.", "published": "2016-06-27 22:00:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08495v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Our annotation scheme is\ncomposed of a series of crowdsourcing tasks with a view to more effectively\nutilize crowdsourcing in the creation of question answering datasets in various\ndomains.

{"title": "STransE: a novel embedding model of entities and relationships in\n  knowledge bases", "abstract": "Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationships\nare useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks.\nHowever, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be\nable to perform link prediction or knowledge base completion, i.e., predict\nwhether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This\npaper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new\nembedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional\nvector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is\na simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link\nprediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding\nmodels. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models\nin the link prediction task.", "published": "2016-06-27 06:50:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08140v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Lifted Rule Injection for Relation Embeddings", "abstract": "Methods based on representation learning currently hold the state-of-the-art\nin many natural language processing and knowledge base inference tasks. Yet, a\nmajor challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into\nsuch models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations\nby propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However,\npropositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and\nrules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating\nimplication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base\nconstruction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean\nspace and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on\nimplication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong\nrestriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the\nexpressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves\ngeneralization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase\nof 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization\nbaseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime.", "published": "2016-06-27 16:39:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08359v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Semantic homophily in online communication: evidence from Twitter", "abstract": "People are observed to assortatively connect on a set of traits. This\nphenomenon, termed assortative mixing or sometimes homophily, can be quantified\nthrough assortativity coefficient in social networks. Uncovering the exact\ncauses of strong assortative mixing found in social networks has been a\nresearch challenge. Among the main suggested causes from sociology are the\ntendency of similar individuals to connect (often itself referred as homophily)\nand the social influence among already connected individuals. An important\nquestion to researchers and in practice can be tackled, as we present here:\nunderstanding the exact mechanisms of interplay between these tendencies and\nthe underlying social network structure. Namely, in addition to the mentioned\nassortativity coefficient, there are several other static and temporal network\nproperties and substructures that can be linked to the tendencies of homophily\nand social influence in the social network and we herein investigate those.\nConcretely, we tackle a computer-mediated \\textit{communication network} (based\non Twitter mentions) and a particular type of assortative mixing that can be\ninferred from the semantic features of communication content that we term\n\\textit{semantic homophily}. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the\nfirst to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily in a communication\nnetwork and the interplay between them. We quantify diverse levels of semantic\nhomophily, identify the semantic aspects that are the drivers of observed\nhomophily, show insights in its temporal evolution and finally, we present its\nintricate interplay with the communication network on Twitter. By analyzing\nthese mechanisms we increase understanding on what are the semantic aspects\nthat shape and how they shape the human computer-mediated communication.", "published": "2016-06-27 11:04:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08207v3", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.HC", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
