{"title": "Adaptation of fictional and online conversations to communication media", "abstract": "Conversations allow the quick transfer of short bits of information and it is\nreasonable to expect that changes in communication medium affect how we\nconverse. Using conversations in works of fiction and in an online social\nnetworking platform, we show that the utterance length of conversations is\nslowly shortening with time but adapts more strongly to the constraints of the\ncommunication medium. This indicates that the introduction of any new medium of\ncommunication can affect the way natural language evolves.", "published": "2013-01-08 07:11:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1429v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
