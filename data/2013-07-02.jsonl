{"title": "Improving Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) by Incorporating\n  Significant Co-occurrence", "abstract": "We design a new co-occurrence based word association measure by incorporating\nthe concept of significant cooccurrence in the popular word association measure\nPointwise Mutual Information (PMI). By extensive experiments with a large\nnumber of publicly available datasets we show that the newly introduced measure\nperforms better than other co-occurrence based measures and despite being\nresource-light, compares well with the best known resource-heavy distributional\nsimilarity and knowledge based word association measures. We investigate the\nsource of this performance improvement and find that of the two types of\nsignificant co-occurrence - corpus-level and document-level, the concept of\ncorpus level significance combined with the use of document counts in place of\nword counts is responsible for all the performance gains observed. The concept\nof document level significance is not helpful for PMI adaptation.", "published": "2013-07-02 06:25:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0596v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
