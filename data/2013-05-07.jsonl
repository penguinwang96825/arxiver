{"title": "Speech Enhancement Modeling Towards Robust Speech Recognition System", "abstract": "Form about four decades human beings have been dreaming of an intelligent\nmachine which can master the natural speech. In its simplest form, this machine\nshould consist of two subsystems, namely automatic speech recognition (ASR) and\nspeech understanding (SU). The goal of ASR is to transcribe natural speech\nwhile SU is to understand the meaning of the transcription. Recognizing and\nunderstanding a spoken sentence is obviously a knowledge-intensive process,\nwhich must take into account all variable information about the speech\ncommunication process, from acoustics to semantics and pragmatics. While\ndeveloping an Automatic Speech Recognition System, it is observed that some\nadverse conditions degrade the performance of the Speech Recognition System. In\nthis contribution, speech enhancement system is introduced for enhancing speech\nsignals corrupted by additive noise and improving the performance of Automatic\nSpeech Recognizers in noisy conditions. Automatic speech recognition\nexperiments show that replacing noisy speech signals by the corresponding\nenhanced speech signals leads to an improvement in the recognition accuracies.\nThe amount of improvement varies with the type of the corrupting noise.", "published": "2013-05-07 07:21:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1426v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
