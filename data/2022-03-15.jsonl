{"title": "Optimal Damping with Hierarchical Adaptive Quadrature for Efficient Fourier Pricing of Multi-Asset Options in L\u00e9vy Models", "abstract": "Efficiently pricing multi-asset options is a challenging problem in quantitative finance. When the characteristic function is available, Fourier-based methods are competitive compared to alternative techniques because the integrand in the frequency space often has a higher regularity than that in the physical space. However, when designing a numerical quadrature method for most Fourier pricing approaches, two key aspects affecting the numerical complexity should be carefully considered: (i) the choice of damping parameters that ensure integrability and control the regularity class of the integrand and (ii) the effective treatment of high dimensionality. We propose an efficient numerical method for pricing European multi-asset options based on two complementary ideas to address these challenges. First, we smooth the Fourier integrand via an optimized choice of the damping parameters based on a proposed optimization rule. Second, we employ sparsification and dimension-adaptivity techniques to accelerate the convergence of the quadrature in high dimensions. The extensive numerical study on basket and rainbow options under the multivariate geometric Brownian motion and some L\u00e9vy models demonstrates the advantages of adaptivity and the damping rule on the numerical complexity of quadrature methods. Moreover, for the tested two-asset examples, the proposed approach outperforms the COS method in terms of computational time. Finally, we show significant speed-up compared to the Monte Carlo method for up to six dimensions.", "published": "2022-03-15 18:48:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08196v4", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.NA", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "An Empirical Study of Market Inefficiencies in Uniswap and SushiSwap", "abstract": "Decentralized exchanges are revolutionizing finance. With their ever-growing increase in popularity, a natural question that begs to be asked is: how efficient are these new markets?\n  We find that nearly 30% of analyzed trades are executed at an unfavorable rate. Additionally, we observe that, especially during the DeFi summer in 2020, price inaccuracies across the market plagued DEXes. Uniswap and SushiSwap, however, quickly adapt to their increased volumes. We see an increase in market efficiency with time during the observation period. Nonetheless, the DEXes still struggle to track the reference market when cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile. During such periods of high volatility, we observe the market becoming less efficient - manifested by an increased prevalence in cyclic arbitrage opportunities.", "published": "2022-03-15 10:55:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07774v2", "categories": ["cs.CE", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.CE"}
