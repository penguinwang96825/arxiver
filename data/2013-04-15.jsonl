{"title": "Hubiness, length, crossings and their relationships in dependency trees", "abstract": "Here tree dependency structures are studied from three different\nperspectives: their degree variance (hubiness), the mean dependency length and\nthe number of dependency crossings. Bounds that reveal pairwise dependencies\namong these three metrics are derived. Hubiness (the variance of degrees) plays\na central role: the mean dependency length is bounded below by hubiness while\nthe number of crossings is bounded above by hubiness. Our findings suggest that\nthe online memory cost of a sentence might be determined not just by the\nordering of words but also by the hubiness of the underlying structure. The 2nd\nmoment of degree plays a crucial role that is reminiscent of its role in large\ncomplex networks.", "published": "2013-04-15 13:10:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4086v5", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DM", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
