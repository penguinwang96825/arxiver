{"title": "Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics", "abstract": "We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating\nsynthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic\ndata produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in\nseveral key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for\nportfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across\nquantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data.\nMoreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market\ndata exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated\ncovariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for\nuse as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an\nefficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte\nCarlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.", "published": "2024-11-21 17:39:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036v3", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.CE", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Wavelet Analysis of Cryptocurrencies -- Non-Linear Dynamics in High Frequency Domains", "abstract": "In this study, we perform some analysis for the probability distributions in\nthe space of frequency and time variables. However, in the domain of high\nfrequencies, it behaves in such a way as the highly non-linear dynamics. The\nwavelet analysis is a powerful tool to perform such analysis in order to search\nfor the characteristics of frequency variations over time for the prices of\nmajor cryptocurrencies. In fact, the wavelet analysis is found to be quite\nuseful as it examine the validity of the efficient market hypothesis in the\nweak form, especially for the presence of the cyclical persistence at different\nfrequencies. If we could find some cyclical persistence at different\nfrequencies, that means that there exist some intrinsic causal relationship for\nsome given investment horizons defined by some chosen sampling scales. This is\none of the characteristic results of the wavelet analysis in the time-frequency\ndomains.", "published": "2024-11-21 12:12:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14058v1", "categories": ["q-fin.GN", "econ.GN", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.GN"}
{"title": "Analytical Formula for Fractional-Order Conditional Moments of Nonlinear Drift CEV Process with Regime Switching: Hybrid Approach with Applications", "abstract": "This paper introduces an analytical formula for the fractional-order\nconditional moments of nonlinear drift constant elasticity of variance\n(NLD-CEV) processes under regime switching, governed by continuous-time\nfinite-state irreducible Markov chains. By employing a hybrid system approach,\nwe derive exact closed-form expressions for these moments across arbitrary\nfractional orders and regime states, thereby enhancing the analytical\ntractability of NLD-CEV models under stochastic regimes. Our methodology hinges\non formulating and solving a complex system of interconnected partial\ndifferential equations derived from the Feynman-Kac formula for switching\ndiffusions. To illustrate the practical relevance of our approach, Monte Carlo\nsimulations for process with Markovian switching are applied to validate the\naccuracy and computational efficiency of the analytical formulas. Furthermore,\nwe apply our findings for the valuation of financial derivatives within a\ndynamic nonlinear mean-reverting regime-switching framework, which demonstrates\nsignificant improvements over traditional methods. This work offers substantial\ncontributions to financial modeling and derivative pricing by providing a\nrobust tool for practitioners and researchers who are dealing with complex\nstochastic environments.", "published": "2024-11-21 08:36:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13937v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Multiscale Markowitz", "abstract": "Traditional Markowitz portfolio optimization constrains daily portfolio\nvariance to a target value, optimising returns, Sharpe or variance within this\nconstraint. However, this approach overlooks the relationship between variance\nat different time scales, typically described by $\\sigma(\\Delta t) \\propto\n(\\Delta t)^{H}$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent, most of the time assumed to be\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). This paper introduces a multifrequency optimization framework\nthat allows investors to specify target portfolio variance across a range of\nfrequencies, characterized by a target Hurst exponent $H_{target}$, or optimize\nthe portfolio at multiple time scales. By incorporating this scaling behavior,\nwe enable a more nuanced and comprehensive risk management strategy that aligns\nwith investor preferences at various time scales. This approach effectively\nmanages portfolio risk across multiple frequencies and adapts to different\nmarket conditions, providing a robust tool for dynamic asset allocation. This\novercomes some of the traditional limitations of Markowitz, when it comes to\ndealing with crashes, regime changes, volatility clustering or multifractality\nin markets. We illustrate this concept with a toy example and discuss the\npractical implementation for assets with varying scaling behaviors.", "published": "2024-11-21 02:37:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13792v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "nlin.CD", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}

The last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation\ntechnique has been used to solve the problem of missing values from this\nresearch data.

The results of this research show that the ARIMA model (0,0,5) is the\nbest model to predict the prices of lower quality rice I (BKB1), lower quality\nrice II (BKB2), medium quality rice I (BKM1), medium quality rice II (BKM2),\nsuper quality rice I (BKS1), and super quality rice II (BKS2). Based on this\nmodel, the results of forecasting rice prices for all qualities show that there\nwas a decline for some time (between September 1, 2023 and September 6, 2023)\nand then remained constant (between September 6, 2023 and December 31, 2023).", "published": "2024-11-21 13:44:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15228v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}

{"title": "Market Making without Regret", "abstract": "We consider a sequential decision-making setting where, at every round $t$, a\nmarket maker posts a bid price $B_t$ and an ask price $A_t$ to an incoming\ntrader (the taker) with a private valuation for one unit of some asset. If the\ntrader's valuation is lower than the bid price, or higher than the ask price,\nthen a trade (sell or buy) occurs. If a trade happens at round $t$, then\nletting $M_t$ be the market price (observed only at the end of round $t$), the\nmaker's utility is $M_t - B_t$ if the maker bought the asset, and $A_t - M_t$\nif they sold it. We characterize the maker's regret with respect to the best\nfixed choice of bid and ask pairs under a variety of assumptions (adversarial,\ni.i.d., and their variants) on the sequence of market prices and valuations.\nOur upper bound analysis unveils an intriguing connection relating market\nmaking to first-price auctions and dynamic pricing. Our main technical\ncontribution is a lower bound for the i.i.d. case with Lipschitz distributions\nand independence between prices and valuations. The difficulty in the analysis\nstems from the unique structure of the reward and feedback functions, allowing\nan algorithm to acquire information by graduating the \"cost of exploration\" in\nan arbitrary way.", "published": "2024-11-21 10:13:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13993v1", "categories": ["cs.GT", "cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.GT"}
{"title": "Does the square-root price impact law belong to the strict universal scalings?: quantitative support by a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange market", "abstract": "Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a\nlong-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality\nof the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law\n(SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law\nwith respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \\propto Q^{\\delta}$\nwith $\\delta \\approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\\delta$\nshould be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend\nthat $\\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries,\nimplying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision\nmeasurements of $\\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks,\nwhich has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic\ndatasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual\naccounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL\nby a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo\nStock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic\ndataset, we show that the exponent $\\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within\nstatistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader\nlevel. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the\nnonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the\nFarmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally\nhigh-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and\ncould prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an\nimportant topic even among practitioners.", "published": "2024-11-21 09:28:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13965v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
