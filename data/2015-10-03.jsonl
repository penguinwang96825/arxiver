{"title": "P-trac Procedure: The Dispersion and Neutralization of Contrasts in\n  Lexicon", "abstract": "Cognitive acoustic cues have an important role in shaping the phonological\nstructure of language as a means to optimal communication. In this paper we\nintroduced P-trac procedure in order to track dispersion of contrasts in\ndifferent contexts in lexicon. The results of applying P-trac procedure to the\ncase of dispersion of contrasts in pre- consonantal contexts and in consonantal\npositions of CVCC sequences in Persian provide Evidence in favor of phonetic\nbasis of dispersion argued by Licensing by Cue hypothesis and the Dispersion\nTheory of Contrast. The P- trac procedure is proved to be very effective in\nrevealing the dispersion of contrasts in lexicon especially when comparing the\ndispersion of contrasts in different contexts.", "published": "2015-10-03 00:13:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00760v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
