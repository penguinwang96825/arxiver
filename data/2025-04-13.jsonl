{"title": "Integrated GARCH-GRU in Financial Volatility Forecasting", "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel integrated Generalized Autoregressive\nConditional Heteroskedasticity-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU) model for\nfinancial volatility modeling and forecasting. The model embeds the GARCH(1,1)\nformulation directly into the GRU cell architecture, yielding a unified\nrecurrent unit that jointly captures both traditional econometric properties\nand complex temporal dynamics. This hybrid structure leverages the strengths of\nGARCH in modeling key stylized facts of financial volatility, such as\nclustering and persistence, while utilizing the GRU's capacity to learn\nnonlinear dependencies from sequential data. Compared to the GARCH-LSTM\ncounterpart, the GARCH-GRU model demonstrates superior computational\nefficiency, requiring significantly less training time, while maintaining and\nimproving forecasting accuracy. Empirical evaluation across multiple financial\ndatasets confirms the model's robust outperformance in terms of mean squared\nerror (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) relative to a range of benchmarks,\nincluding standard neural networks, alternative hybrid architectures, and\nclassical GARCH-type models. As an application, we compute Value-at-Risk (VaR)\nusing the model's volatility forecasts and observe lower violation ratios,\nfurther validating the predictive reliability of the proposed framework in\npractical risk management settings.", "published": "2025-04-13 00:04:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09380v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
