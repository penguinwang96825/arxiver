{"title": "A Multi-Task Architecture on Relevance-based Neural Query Translation", "abstract": "We describe a multi-task learning approach to train a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model with a Relevance-based Auxiliary Task (RAT) for search query translation. The translation process for Cross-lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) task is usually treated as a black box and it is performed as an independent step. However, an NMT model trained on sentence-level parallel data is not aware of the vocabulary distribution of the retrieval corpus. We address this problem with our multi-task learning architecture that achieves 16% improvement over a strong NMT baseline on Italian-English query-document dataset. We show using both quantitative and qualitative analysis that our model generates balanced and precise translations with the regularization effect it achieves from multi-task learning paradigm.", "published": "2019-06-17 05:37:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06849v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
