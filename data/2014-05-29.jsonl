{"title": "Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis to Extract Meticulous Opinion Value", "abstract": "Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is a process of identifying opinions in\nlarge unstructured/structured data and then analysing polarity of those\nopinions. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis have found vast application in\nanalysing online ratings, analysing product based reviews, e-governance, and\nmanaging hostile content over the internet. This paper proposes an algorithm to\nimplement aspect level sentiment analysis. The algorithm takes input from the\nremarks submitted by various teachers of a student. An aspect tree is formed\nwhich has various levels and weights are assigned to each branch to identify\nlevel of aspect. Aspect value is calculated by the algorithm by means of the\nproposed aspect tree. Dictionary based method is implemented to evaluate the\npolarity of the remark. The algorithm returns the aspect value clubbed with\nopinion value and sentiment value which helps in concluding the summarized\nvalue of remark.", "published": "2014-05-29 11:05:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7519v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
