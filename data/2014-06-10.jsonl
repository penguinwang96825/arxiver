{"title": "Controlled Natural Language Generation from a Multilingual\n  FrameNet-based Grammar", "abstract": "This paper presents a currently bilingual but potentially multilingual\nFrameNet-based grammar library implemented in Grammatical Framework. The\ncontribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it offers a methodological\napproach to automatically generate the grammar based on semantico-syntactic\nvalence patterns extracted from FrameNet-annotated corpora. Second, it provides\na proof of concept for two use cases illustrating how the acquired multilingual\ngrammar can be exploited in different CNL applications in the domains of arts\nand tourism.", "published": "2014-06-10 01:01:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2400v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Multiplicative Model for Learning Distributed Text-Based Attribute\n  Representations", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a general framework for learning distributed\nrepresentations of attributes: characteristics of text whose representations\ncan be jointly learned with word embeddings. Attributes can correspond to\ndocument indicators (to learn sentence vectors), language indicators (to learn\ndistributed language representations), meta-data and side information (such as\nthe age, gender and industry of a blogger) or representations of authors. We\ndescribe a third-order model where word context and attribute vectors interact\nmultiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence. This leads to the\nnotion of conditional word similarity: how meanings of words change when\nconditioned on different attributes. We perform several experimental tasks\nincluding sentiment classification, cross-lingual document classification, and\nblog authorship attribution. We also qualitatively evaluate conditional word\nneighbours and attribute-conditioned text generation.", "published": "2014-06-10 20:29:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2710v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "FrameNet CNL: a Knowledge Representation and Information Extraction\n  Language", "abstract": "The paper presents a FrameNet-based information extraction and knowledge\nrepresentation framework, called FrameNet-CNL. The framework is used on natural\nlanguage documents and represents the extracted knowledge in a tailor-made\nFrame-ontology from which unambiguous FrameNet-CNL paraphrase text can be\ngenerated automatically in multiple languages. This approach brings together\nthe fields of information extraction and CNL, because a source text can be\nconsidered belonging to FrameNet-CNL, if information extraction parser produces\nthe correct knowledge representation as a result. We describe a\nstate-of-the-art information extraction parser used by a national news agency\nand speculate that FrameNet-CNL eventually could shape the natural language\nsubset used for writing the newswire articles.", "published": "2014-06-10 13:16:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2538v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
