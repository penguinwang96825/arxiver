{"title": "A Statistical Parsing Framework for Sentiment Classification", "abstract": "We present a statistical parsing framework for sentence-level sentiment\nclassification in this article. Unlike previous works that employ syntactic\nparsing results for sentiment analysis, we develop a statistical parser to\ndirectly analyze the sentiment structure of a sentence. We show that\ncomplicated phenomena in sentiment analysis (e.g., negation, intensification,\nand contrast) can be handled the same as simple and straightforward sentiment\nexpressions in a unified and probabilistic way. We formulate the sentiment\ngrammar upon Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), and provide a formal description of\nthe sentiment parsing framework. We develop the parsing model to obtain\npossible sentiment parse trees for a sentence, from which the polarity model is\nproposed to derive the sentiment strength and polarity, and the ranking model\nis dedicated to selecting the best sentiment tree. We train the parser directly\nfrom examples of sentences annotated only with sentiment polarity labels but\nwithout any syntactic annotations or polarity annotations of constituents\nwithin sentences. Therefore we can obtain training data easily. In particular,\nwe train a sentiment parser, s.parser, from a large amount of review sentences\nwith users' ratings as rough sentiment polarity labels. Extensive experiments\non existing benchmark datasets show significant improvements over baseline\nsentiment classification approaches.", "published": "2014-01-24 12:56:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6330v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
