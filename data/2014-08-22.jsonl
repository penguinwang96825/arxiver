{"title": "Neural Mechanism of Language", "abstract": "This paper is based on our previous work on neural coding. It is a\nself-organized model supported by existing evidences. Firstly, we briefly\nintroduce this model in this paper, and then we explain the neural mechanism of\nlanguage and reasoning with it. Moreover, we find that the position of an area\ndetermines its importance. Specifically, language relevant areas are in the\ncapital position of the cortical kingdom. Therefore they are closely related\nwith autonomous consciousness and working memories. In essence, language is a\nminiature of the real world. Briefly, this paper would like to bridge the gap\nbetween molecule mechanism of neurons and advanced functions such as language\nand reasoning.", "published": "2014-08-22 12:15:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5403v1", "categories": ["cs.NE", "cs.CL", "q-bio.NC"], "primary_category": "cs.NE"}
