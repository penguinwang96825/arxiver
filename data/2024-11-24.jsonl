{"title": "A Decision Support System for Stock Selection and Asset Allocation Based on Fundamental Data Analysis", "abstract": "Financial markets are integral to a country's economic success, yet their\ncomplex nature raises challenging issues for predicting their behaviors. There\nis a growing demand for an integrated system that explores the vast and diverse\ndata in financial reports with powerful machine-learning models to analyze\nfinancial markets and suggest appropriate investment strategies. This research\nprovides an end-to-end decision support system (DSS) that pervasively covers\nthe stages of gathering, cleaning, and modeling the stock's financial and\nfundamental data alongside the country's macroeconomic conditions. Analyzing\nand modeling the fundamental data of securities is a noteworthy method that,\ndespite its greater power, has been used by fewer researchers due to its more\ncomplex and challenging issues. By precisely analyzing securities' fundamental\ndata, the proposed system assists investors in predicting stock future prices\nand allocating assets in major financial markets: stock, bond, and commodity.\nThe most notable contributions and innovations of this research are: (1)\nDeveloping a robust predictive model for mid- to long-term stock returns,\ntailored for investors rather than traders, (2) The proposed DSS considers a\ndiverse set of features relating to the economic conditions of the company,\nincluding fundamental data, stock trading characteristics, and macro-economic\nattributes to enhance predictive accuracy, (3) Evaluating the DSS performance\non the Tehran Stock Exchange that has specific characteristics of small to\nmedium-sized economies with high inflation rates and showing the superiority to\nnovel researches, and (4) Empowering the DSS to generate different asset\nallocation strategies in various economic situations by simulating expert\ninvestor decision-making.", "published": "2024-11-24 17:27:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05297v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Quantile deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction", "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is crucial in time series prediction, and quantile\nregression offers a valuable mechanism for uncertainty quantification which is\nuseful for extreme value forecasting. Although deep learning models have been\nprominent in multi-step ahead prediction, the development and evaluation of\nquantile deep learning models have been limited. We present a novel quantile\nregression deep learning framework for multi-step time series prediction. In\nthis way, we elevate the capabilities of deep learning models by incorporating\nquantile regression, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of predictive\nvalues. We provide an implementation of prominent deep learning models for\nmulti-step ahead time series prediction and evaluate their performance under\nhigh volatility and extreme conditions. We include multivariate and univariate\nmodelling, strategies and provide a comparison with conventional deep learning\nmodels from the literature. Our models are tested on two cryptocurrencies:\nBitcoin and Ethereum, using daily close-price data and selected benchmark time\nseries datasets. The results show that integrating a quantile loss function\nwith deep learning provides additional predictions for selected quantiles\nwithout a loss in the prediction accuracy when compared to the literature. Our\nquantile model has the ability to handle volatility more effectively and\nprovides additional information for decision-making and uncertainty\nquantification through the use of quantiles when compared to conventional deep\nlearning models.", "published": "2024-11-24 00:00:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15674v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.ST", "stat.ME"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
