{"title": "Robust Conversational AI with Grounded Text Generation", "abstract": "This article presents a hybrid approach based on a Grounded Text Generation (GTG) model to building robust task bots at scale. GTG is a hybrid model which uses a large-scale Transformer neural network as its backbone, combined with symbol-manipulation modules for knowledge base inference and prior knowledge encoding, to generate responses grounded in dialog belief state and real-world knowledge for task completion. GTG is pre-trained on large amounts of raw text and human conversational data, and can be fine-tuned to complete a wide range of tasks.\n  The hybrid approach and its variants are being developed simultaneously by multiple research teams. The primary results reported on task-oriented dialog benchmarks are very promising, demonstrating the big potential of this approach. This article provides an overview of this progress and discusses related methods and technologies that can be incorporated for building robust conversational AI systems.", "published": "2020-09-07 23:49:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03457v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Active Learning of Causal Structures with Deep Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We study the problem of experiment design to learn causal structures from interventional data. We consider an active learning setting in which the experimenter decides to intervene on one of the variables in the system in each step and uses the results of the intervention to recover further causal relationships among the variables. The goal is to fully identify the causal structures with minimum number of interventions. We present the first deep reinforcement learning based solution for the problem of experiment design. In the proposed method, we embed input graphs to vectors using a graph neural network and feed them to another neural network which outputs a variable for performing intervention in each step. Both networks are trained jointly via a Q-iteration algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in recovering causal structures with respect to previous works, while significantly reducing execution time in dense graphs.", "published": "2020-09-07 10:49:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03009v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Modelling Gossip Interactions in Open Multi-Agent Systems", "abstract": "We consider open multi-agent systems, which are systems subject to frequent arrivals and departures of agents while the studied process takes place. We study the behavior of all-to-all pairwise gossip interactions in such open systems. Arrivals and departures of agents imply that the composition and size of the system evolve with time, and in particular prevent convergence. We describe the expected behavior of the system by showing that the evolution of scale-independent quantities can be characterized exactly by a fixed-size linear dynamical system. We apply this approach to characterize the evolution of the two first moments (and thus also of the variance) for open systems of fixed and variable size. Our approach is based on the continuous-time modelling of random asynchronous events impacting the systems (gossip steps, arrivals, departures, and replacements), and can be extended to other types of events.", "published": "2020-09-07 09:30:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02970v2", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Unfolding by Folding: a resampling approach to the problem of matrix inversion without actually inverting any matrix", "abstract": "Matrix inversion problems are often encountered in experimental physics, and in particular in high-energy particle physics, under the name of unfolding. The true spectrum of a physical quantity is deformed by the presence of a detector, resulting in an observed spectrum. If we discretize both the true and observed spectra into histograms, we can model the detector response via a matrix. Inferring a true spectrum starting from an observed spectrum requires therefore inverting the response matrix. Many methods exist in literature for this task, all starting from the observed spectrum and using a simulated true spectrum as a guide to obtain a meaningful solution in cases where the response matrix is not easily invertible.\n  In this Manuscript, I take a different approach to the unfolding problem. Rather than inverting the response matrix and transforming the observed distribution into the most likely parent distribution in generator space, I sample many distributions in generator space, fold them through the original response matrix, and pick the generator-level distribution that yields the folded distribution closest to the data distribution. Regularization schemes can be introduced to treat the case where non-diagonal response matrices result in high-frequency oscillations of the solution in true space, and the introduced bias is studied.\n  The algorithm performs as well as traditional unfolding algorithms in cases where the inverse problem is well-defined in terms of the discretization of the true and smeared space, and outperforms them in cases where the inverse problem is ill-defined---when the number of truth-space bins is larger than that of smeared-space bins. These advantages stem from the fact that the algorithm does not technically invert any matrix and uses only the data distribution as a guide to choose the best solution.", "published": "2020-09-07 07:20:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02913v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "hep-ex", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "An End-to-end Architecture of Online Multi-channel Speech Separation", "abstract": "Multi-speaker speech recognition has been one of the keychallenges in conversation transcription as it breaks the singleactive speaker assumption employed by most state-of-the-artspeech recognition systems. Speech separation is consideredas a remedy to this problem. Previously, we introduced a sys-tem, calledunmixing,fixed-beamformerandextraction(UFE),that was shown to be effective in addressing the speech over-lap problem in conversation transcription. With UFE, an inputmixed signal is processed by fixed beamformers, followed by aneural network post filtering. Although promising results wereobtained, the system contains multiple individually developedmodules, leading potentially sub-optimum performance. In thiswork, we introduce an end-to-end modeling version of UFE. Toenable gradient propagation all the way, an attentional selectionmodule is proposed, where an attentional weight is learnt foreach beamformer and spatial feature sampled over space. Ex-perimental results show that the proposed system achieves com-parable performance in an offline evaluation with the originalseparate processing-based pipeline, while producing remark-able improvements in an online evaluation.", "published": "2020-09-07 14:53:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03141v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
