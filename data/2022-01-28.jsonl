{"title": "Positive Rate Binary Interactive Error Correcting Codes Resilient to $>\\frac12$ Adversarial Erasures", "abstract": "An interactive error correcting code ($\\mathsf{iECC}$) is an interactive protocol with the guarantee that the receiver can correctly determine the sender's message, even in the presence of noise. This generalizes the concept of an error correcting code ($\\mathsf{ECC}$), which is a non-interactive $\\mathsf{iECC}$ that is known to have erasure resilience capped at $\\frac12$. The work of \\cite{GuptaTZ21} constructed the first $\\mathsf{iECC}$ resilient to $> \\frac12$ adversarial erasures. However, their $\\mathsf{iECC}$ has communication complexity quadratic in the message size. In our work, we construct the first positive rate $\\mathsf{iECC}$ resilient to $> \\frac12$ adversarial erasures. For any $\u03b5> 0$, our $\\mathsf{iECC}$ is resilient to $\\frac6{11} - \u03b5$ adversarial erasures and has size $O_\u03b5(n)$.", "published": "2022-01-28 04:27:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11929v1", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
