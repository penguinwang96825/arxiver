{"title": "Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine: A Unified System\n  Architecture Overview", "abstract": "In modern electronic medical records (EMR) much of the clinically important\ndata - signs and symptoms, symptom severity, disease status, etc. - are not\nprovided in structured data fields, but rather are encoded in clinician\ngenerated narrative text. Natural language processing (NLP) provides a means of\n\"unlocking\" this important data source for applications in clinical decision\nsupport, quality assurance, and public health. This chapter provides an\noverview of representative NLP systems in biomedicine based on a unified\narchitectural view. A general architecture in an NLP system consists of two\nmain components: background knowledge that includes biomedical knowledge\nresources and a framework that integrates NLP tools to process text. Systems\ndiffer in both components, which we will review briefly. Additionally,\nchallenges facing current research efforts in biomedical NLP include the\npaucity of large, publicly available annotated corpora, although initiatives\nthat facilitate data sharing, system evaluation, and collaborative work between\nresearchers in clinical NLP are starting to emerge.", "published": "2014-01-03 00:57:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0569v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multi-Topic Multi-Document Summarizer", "abstract": "Current multi-document summarization systems can successfully extract summary\nsentences, however with many limitations including: low coverage, inaccurate\nextraction to important sentences, redundancy and poor coherence among the\nselected sentences. The present study introduces a new concept of centroid\napproach and reports new techniques for extracting summary sentences for\nmulti-document. In both techniques keyphrases are used to weigh sentences and\ndocuments. The first summarization technique (Sen-Rich) prefers maximum\nrichness sentences. While the second (Doc-Rich), prefers sentences from\ncentroid document. To demonstrate the new summarization system application to\nextract summaries of Arabic documents we performed two experiments. First, we\napplied Rouge measure to compare the new techniques among systems presented at\nTAC2011. The results show that Sen-Rich outperformed all systems in ROUGE-S.\nSecond, the system was applied to summarize multi-topic documents. Using human\nevaluators, the results show that Doc-Rich is the superior, where summary\nsentences characterized by extra coverage and more cohesion.", "published": "2014-01-03 13:07:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0640v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Plurals: individuals and sets in a richly typed semantics", "abstract": "We developed a type-theoretical framework for natural lan- guage semantics\nthat, in addition to the usual Montagovian treatment of compositional\nsemantics, includes a treatment of some phenomena of lex- ical semantic:\ncoercions, meaning, transfers, (in)felicitous co-predication. In this setting\nwe see how the various readings of plurals (collective, dis- tributive,\ncoverings,...) can be modelled.", "published": "2014-01-03 15:37:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0660v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Quantitative methods for Phylogenetic Inference in Historical\n  Linguistics: An experimental case study of South Central Dravidian", "abstract": "In this paper we examine the usefulness of two classes of algorithms Distance\nMethods, Discrete Character Methods (Felsenstein and Felsenstein 2003) widely\nused in genetics, for predicting the family relationships among a set of\nrelated languages and therefore, diachronic language change. Applying these\nalgorithms to the data on the numbers of shared cognates- with-change and\nchanged as well as unchanged cognates for a group of six languages belonging to\na Dravidian language sub-family given in Krishnamurti et al. (1983), we\nobserved that the resultant phylogenetic trees are largely in agreement with\nthe linguistic family tree constructed using the comparative method of\nreconstruction with only a few minor differences. Furthermore, we studied these\nminor differences and found that they were cases of genuine ambiguity even for\na well-trained historical linguist. We evaluated the trees obtained through our\nexperiments using a well-defined criterion and report the results here. We\nfinally conclude that quantitative methods like the ones we examined are quite\nuseful in predicting family relationships among languages. In addition, we\nconclude that a modest degree of confidence attached to the intuition that\nthere could indeed exist a parallelism between the processes of linguistic and\ngenetic change is not totally misplaced.", "published": "2014-01-03 20:17:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0708v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
