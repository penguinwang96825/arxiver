{"title": "A semi-Lagrangian $\u03b5$-monotone Fourier method for continuous withdrawal GMWBs under jump-diffusion with stochastic interest rate", "abstract": "We develop an efficient pricing approach for guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWBs) with continuous withdrawals under a realistic modeling setting with jump-diffusions and stochastic interest rate. Utilizing an impulse stochastic control framework, we formulate the no-arbitrage GMWB pricing problem as a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Quasi-Variational Inequality (QVI) having three spatial dimensions with cross derivative terms. Through a novel numerical approach built upon a combination of a semi-Lagrangian method and the Green's function of an associated linear partial integro-differential equation, we develop an $\u03b5$-monotone Fourier pricing method, where $\u03b5> 0$ is a monotonicity tolerance. Together with a provable strong comparison result for the HJB-QVI, we mathematically demonstrate convergence of the proposed scheme to the viscosity solution of the HJB-QVI as $\u03b5\\to 0$. We present a comprehensive study of the impact of simultaneously considering jumps in the sub-account process and stochastic interest rate on the no-arbitrage prices and fair insurance fees of GMWBs, as well as on the holder's optimal withdrawal behaviors.", "published": "2023-10-01 07:48:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00606v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
