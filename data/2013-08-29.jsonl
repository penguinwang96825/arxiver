{"title": "Joint Video and Text Parsing for Understanding Events and Answering\n  Queries", "abstract": "We propose a framework for parsing video and text jointly for understanding\nevents and answering user queries. Our framework produces a parse graph that\nrepresents the compositional structures of spatial information (objects and\nscenes), temporal information (actions and events) and causal information\n(causalities between events and fluents) in the video and text. The knowledge\nrepresentation of our framework is based on a spatial-temporal-causal And-Or\ngraph (S/T/C-AOG), which jointly models possible hierarchical compositions of\nobjects, scenes and events as well as their interactions and mutual contexts,\nand specifies the prior probabilistic distribution of the parse graphs. We\npresent a probabilistic generative model for joint parsing that captures the\nrelations between the input video/text, their corresponding parse graphs and\nthe joint parse graph. Based on the probabilistic model, we propose a joint\nparsing system consisting of three modules: video parsing, text parsing and\njoint inference. Video parsing and text parsing produce two parse graphs from\nthe input video and text respectively. The joint inference module produces a\njoint parse graph by performing matching, deduction and revision on the video\nand text parse graphs. The proposed framework has the following objectives:\nFirstly, we aim at deep semantic parsing of video and text that goes beyond the\ntraditional bag-of-words approaches; Secondly, we perform parsing and reasoning\nacross the spatial, temporal and causal dimensions based on the joint S/T/C-AOG\nrepresentation; Thirdly, we show that deep joint parsing facilitates subsequent\napplications such as generating narrative text descriptions and answering\nqueries in the forms of who, what, when, where and why. We empirically\nevaluated our system based on comparison against ground-truth as well as\naccuracy of query answering and obtained satisfactory results.", "published": "2013-08-29 23:45:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6628v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.MM"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
