{"title": "Implementation of nlization framework for verbs, pronouns and\n  determiners with eugene", "abstract": "UNL system is designed and implemented by a nonprofit organization, UNDL\nFoundation at Geneva in 1999. UNL applications are application softwares that\nallow end users to accomplish natural language tasks, such as translating,\nsummarizing, retrieving or extracting information, etc. Two major web based\napplication softwares are Interactive ANalyzer (IAN), which is a natural\nlanguage analysis system. It represents natural language sentences as semantic\nnetworks in the UNL format. Other application software is dEep-to-sUrface\nGENErator (EUGENE), which is an open-source interactive NLizer. It generates\nnatural language sentences out of semantic networks represented in the UNL\nformat. In this paper, NLization framework with EUGENE is focused, while using\nUNL system for accomplishing the task of machine translation. In whole\nNLization process, EUGENE takes a UNL input and delivers an output in natural\nlanguage without any human intervention. It is language-independent and has to\nbe parametrized to the natural language input through a dictionary and a\ngrammar, provided as separate interpretable files. In this paper, it is\nexplained that how UNL input is syntactically and semantically analyzed with\nthe UNL-NL T-Grammar for NLization of UNL sentences involving verbs, pronouns\nand determiners for Punjabi natural language.", "published": "2013-09-10 12:03:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2471v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
