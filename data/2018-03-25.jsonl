{"title": "Pay More Attention - Neural Architectures for Question-Answering", "abstract": "Machine comprehension is a representative task of natural language\nunderstanding. Typically, we are given context paragraph and the objective is\nto answer a question that depends on the context. Such a problem requires to\nmodel the complex interactions between the context paragraph and the question.\nLately, attention mechanisms have been found to be quite successful at these\ntasks and in particular, attention mechanisms with attention flow from both\ncontext-to-question and question-to-context have been proven to be quite\nuseful. In this paper, we study two state-of-the-art attention mechanisms\ncalled Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BiDAF) and Dynamic Co-Attention Network\n(DCN) and propose a hybrid scheme combining these two architectures that gives\nbetter overall performance. Moreover, we also suggest a new simpler attention\nmechanism that we call Double Cross Attention (DCA) that provides better\nresults compared to both BiDAF and Co-Attention mechanisms while providing\nsimilar performance as the hybrid scheme. The objective of our paper is to\nfocus particularly on the attention layer and to suggest improvements on that.\nOur experimental evaluations show that both our proposed models achieve\nsuperior results on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) compared to\nBiDAF and DCN attention mechanisms.", "published": "2018-03-25 10:58:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09230v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing Meaning through Word Embeddings", "abstract": "We demonstrate the utility of a new methodological tool, neural-network word\nembedding models, for large-scale text analysis, revealing how these models\nproduce richer insights into cultural associations and categories than possible\nwith prior methods. Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words\nas geometric relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space,\noperationalizing a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary\ntheories of identity and culture. We show that dimensions induced by word\ndifferences (e.g. man - woman, rich - poor, black - white, liberal -\nconservative) in these vector spaces closely correspond to dimensions of\ncultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects\nwidely shared cultural connotations when compared to surveyed responses and\nlabeled historical data. We pilot a method for testing the stability of these\nassociations, then demonstrate applications of word embeddings for\nmacro-cultural investigation with a longitudinal analysis of the coevolution of\ngender and class associations in the United States over the 20th century and a\ncomparative analysis of historic distinctions between markers of gender and\nclass in the U.S. and Britain. We argue that the success of these\nhigh-dimensional models motivates a move towards \"high-dimensional theorizing\"\nof meanings, identities and cultural processes.", "published": "2018-03-25 16:08:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09288v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Text Segmentation as a Supervised Learning Task", "abstract": "Text segmentation, the task of dividing a document into contiguous segments\nbased on its semantic structure, is a longstanding challenge in language\nunderstanding. Previous work on text segmentation focused on unsupervised\nmethods such as clustering or graph search, due to the paucity in labeled data.\nIn this work, we formulate text segmentation as a supervised learning problem,\nand present a large new dataset for text segmentation that is automatically\nextracted and labeled from Wikipedia. Moreover, we develop a segmentation model\nbased on this dataset and show that it generalizes well to unseen natural text.", "published": "2018-03-25 20:53:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09337v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Scene Graph Parsing as Dependency Parsing", "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of parsing structured knowledge graphs\nfrom textual descriptions. In particular, we consider the scene graph\nrepresentation that considers objects together with their attributes and\nrelations: this representation has been proved useful across a variety of\nvision and language applications. We begin by introducing an alternative but\nequivalent edge-centric view of scene graphs that connect to dependency parses.\nTogether with a careful redesign of label and action space, we combine the\ntwo-stage pipeline used in prior work (generic dependency parsing followed by\nsimple post-processing) into one, enabling end-to-end training. The scene\ngraphs generated by our learned neural dependency parser achieve an F-score\nsimilarity of 49.67% to ground truth graphs on our evaluation set, surpassing\nbest previous approaches by 5%. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nlearned parser on image retrieval applications.", "published": "2018-03-25 01:53:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09189v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Environmental Sounds with Multi-scale Convolutional Neural\n  Network", "abstract": "Deep learning has dramatically improved the performance of sounds\nrecognition. However, learning acoustic models directly from the raw waveform\nis still challenging. Current waveform-based models generally use time-domain\nconvolutional layers to extract features. The features extracted by single size\nfilters are insufficient for building discriminative representation of audios.\nIn this paper, we propose multi-scale convolution operation, which can get\nbetter audio representation by improving the frequency resolution and learning\nfilters cross all frequency area. For leveraging the waveform-based features\nand spectrogram-based features in a single model, we introduce two-phase method\nto fuse the different features. Finally, we propose a novel end-to-end network\ncalled WaveMsNet based on the multi-scale convolution operation and two-phase\nmethod. On the environmental sounds classification datasets ESC-10 and ESC-50,\nthe classification accuracies of our WaveMsNet achieve 93.75% and 79.10%\nrespectively, which improve significantly from the previous methods.", "published": "2018-03-25 04:46:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10219v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
