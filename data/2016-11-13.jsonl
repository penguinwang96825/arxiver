{"title": "Cross-lingual Dataless Classification for Languages with Small Wikipedia\n  Presence", "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to classify documents in any language into an\nEnglish topical label space, without any text categorization training data. The\napproach, Cross-Lingual Dataless Document Classification (CLDDC) relies on\nmapping the English labels or short category description into a Wikipedia-based\nsemantic representation, and on the use of the target language Wikipedia.\nConsequently, performance could suffer when Wikipedia in the target language is\nsmall. In this paper, we focus on languages with small Wikipedias,\n(Small-Wikipedia languages, SWLs). We use a word-level dictionary to convert\ndocuments in a SWL to a large-Wikipedia language (LWLs), and then perform CLDDC\nbased on the LWL's Wikipedia. This approach can be applied to thousands of\nlanguages, which can be contrasted with machine translation, which is a\nsupervision heavy approach and can be done for about 100 languages. We also\ndevelop a ranking algorithm that makes use of language similarity metrics to\nautomatically select a good LWL, and show that this significantly improves\nclassification of SWLs' documents, performing comparably to the best bridge\npossible.", "published": "2016-11-13 12:20:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04122v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Joint Representation Learning of Text and Knowledge for Knowledge Graph\n  Completion", "abstract": "Joint representation learning of text and knowledge within a unified semantic\nspace enables us to perform knowledge graph completion more accurately. In this\nwork, we propose a novel framework to embed words, entities and relations into\nthe same continuous vector space. In this model, both entity and relation\nembeddings are learned by taking knowledge graph and plain text into\nconsideration. In experiments, we evaluate the joint learning model on three\ntasks including entity prediction, relation prediction and relation\nclassification from text. The experiment results show that our model can\nsignificantly and consistently improve the performance on the three tasks as\ncompared with other baselines.", "published": "2016-11-13 12:32:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04125v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
