{"title": "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis", "abstract": "Social network has gained remarkable attention in the last decade. Accessing\nsocial network sites such as Twitter, Facebook LinkedIn and Google+ through the\ninternet and the web 2.0 technologies has become more affordable. People are\nbecoming more interested in and relying on social network for information, news\nand opinion of other users on diverse subject matters. The heavy reliance on\nsocial network sites causes them to generate massive data characterised by\nthree computational issues namely; size, noise and dynamism. These issues often\nmake social network data very complex to analyse manually, resulting in the\npertinent use of computational means of analysing them. Data mining provides a\nwide range of techniques for detecting useful knowledge from massive datasets\nlike trends, patterns and rules [44]. Data mining techniques are used for\ninformation retrieval, statistical modelling and machine learning. These\ntechniques employ data pre-processing, data analysis, and data interpretation\nprocesses in the course of data analysis. This survey discusses different data\nmining techniques used in mining diverse aspects of the social network over\ndecades going from the historical techniques to the up-to-date models,\nincluding our novel technique named TRCM. All the techniques covered in this\nsurvey are listed in the Table.1 including the tools employed as well as names\nof their authors.", "published": "2013-12-17 02:53:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4617v2", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Designing Spontaneous Speech Search Interface for Historical Archives", "abstract": "Spontaneous speech in the form of conversations, meetings, voice-mail,\ninterviews, oral history, etc. is one of the most ubiquitous forms of human\ncommunication. Search engines providing access to such speech collections have\nthe potential to better inform intelligence and make relevant data over vast\naudio/video archives available to users. This project presents a search user\ninterface design supporting search tasks over a speech collection consisting of\nan historical archive with nearly 52,000 audiovisual testimonies of survivors\nand witnesses of the Holocaust and other genocides. The design incorporates\nfaceted search, along with other UI elements like highlighted search items,\ntags, snippets, etc., to promote discovery and exploratory search. Two\ndifferent designs have been created to support both manual and automated\ntranscripts. Evaluation was performed using human subjects to measure accuracy\nin retrieving results, understanding user-perspective on the design elements,\nand ease of parsing information.", "published": "2013-12-17 10:18:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4706v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
{"title": "Generation, Implementation and Appraisal of an N-gram based Stemming\n  Algorithm", "abstract": "A language independent stemmer has always been looked for. Single N-gram\ntokenization technique works well, however, it often generates stems that start\nwith intermediate characters, rather than initial ones. We present a novel\ntechnique that takes the concept of N gram stemming one step ahead and compare\nour method with an established algorithm in the field, Porter's Stemmer.\nResults indicate that our N gram stemmer is not inferior to Porter's linguistic\nstemmer.", "published": "2013-12-17 15:32:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4824v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
