{"title": "Bi-directional LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for Chinese Word\n  Segmentation", "abstract": "Recurrent neural network(RNN) has been broadly applied to natural language\nprocessing(NLP) problems. This kind of neural network is designed for modeling\nsequential data and has been testified to be quite efficient in sequential\ntagging tasks. In this paper, we propose to use bi-directional RNN with long\nshort-term memory(LSTM) units for Chinese word segmentation, which is a crucial\npreprocess task for modeling Chinese sentences and articles. Classical methods\nfocus on designing and combining hand-craft features from context, whereas\nbi-directional LSTM network(BLSTM) does not need any prior knowledge or\npre-designing, and it is expert in keeping the contextual information in both\ndirections. Experiment result shows that our approach gets state-of-the-art\nperformance in word segmentation on both traditional Chinese datasets and\nsimplified Chinese datasets.", "published": "2016-02-16 00:45:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04874v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Generalized minimum dominating set and application in automatic text\n  summarization", "abstract": "For a graph formed by vertices and weighted edges, a generalized minimum\ndominating set (MDS) is a vertex set of smallest cardinality such that the\nsummed weight of edges from each outside vertex to vertices in this set is\nequal to or larger than certain threshold value. This generalized MDS problem\nreduces to the conventional MDS problem in the limiting case of all the edge\nweights being equal to the threshold value. We treat the generalized MDS\nproblem in the present paper by a replica-symmetric spin glass theory and\nderive a set of belief-propagation equations. As a practical application we\nconsider the problem of extracting a set of sentences that best summarize a\ngiven input text document. We carry out a preliminary test of the statistical\nphysics-inspired method to this automatic text summarization problem.", "published": "2016-02-16 07:43:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04930v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Contextual Media Retrieval Using Natural Language Queries", "abstract": "The widespread integration of cameras in hand-held and head-worn devices as\nwell as the ability to share content online enables a large and diverse visual\ncapture of the world that millions of users build up collectively every day. We\nenvision these images as well as associated meta information, such as GPS\ncoordinates and timestamps, to form a collective visual memory that can be\nqueried while automatically taking the ever-changing context of mobile users\ninto account. As a first step towards this vision, in this work we present\nXplore-M-Ego: a novel media retrieval system that allows users to query a\ndynamic database of images and videos using spatio-temporal natural language\nqueries. We evaluate our system using a new dataset of real user queries as\nwell as through a usability study. One key finding is that there is a\nconsiderable amount of inter-user variability, for example in the resolution of\nspatial relations in natural language utterances. We show that our retrieval\nsystem can cope with this variability using personalisation through an online\nlearning-based retrieval formulation.", "published": "2016-02-16 11:04:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04983v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.HC", "H.3.3; H.5.1; I.2.6; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
