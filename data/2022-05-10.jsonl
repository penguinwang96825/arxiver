{"title": "Deep learning based Chinese text sentiment mining and stock market correlation research", "abstract": "We explore how to crawl financial forum data such as stock bars and combine them with deep learning models for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we will use the BERT model to train against the financial corpus and predict the SZSE Component Index, and find that applying the BERT model to the financial corpus through the maximum information coefficient comparison study. The obtained sentiment features will be able to reflect the fluctuations in the stock market and help to improve the prediction accuracy effectively. Meanwhile, this paper combines deep learning with financial text, in further exploring the mechanism of investor sentiment on stock market through deep learning method, which will be beneficial for national regulators and policy departments to develop more reasonable policy guidelines for maintaining the stability of stock market.", "published": "2022-05-10 08:35:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04743v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Convergence of the financial value of weak information for a sequence of discrete-time markets", "abstract": "We examine weak anticipations in discrete-time and continuous-time financial markets consisting of one risk-free asset and multiple risky assets, defining a minimal probability measure associated with the anticipation that does not depend on the choice of a utility function. We then define the financial value of weak information in the discrete-time economies and show that these values converge to the financial value of weak information in the continuous-time economy in the case of a complete market.", "published": "2022-05-10 19:35:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05133v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
{"title": "Large Scale Probabilistic Simulation of Renewables Production", "abstract": "We develop a probabilistic framework for joint simulation of short-term electricity generation from renewable assets. In this paper we describe a method for producing hourly day-ahead scenarios of generated power at grid-scale across hundreds of assets. These scenarios are conditional on specified forecasts and yield a full uncertainty quantification both at the marginal asset-level and across asset collections. Our simulation pipeline first applies asset calibration to normalize hourly, daily and seasonal generation profiles, and to Gaussianize the forecast--actuals distribution. We then develop a novel clustering approach to stably estimate the covariance matrix across assets; clustering is done hierarchically to achieve scalability. An extended case study using an ERCOT-like system with nearly 500 solar and wind farms is used for illustration.", "published": "2022-05-10 08:16:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04736v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
