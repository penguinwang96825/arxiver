{"title": "Communicating with sentences: A multi-word naming game model", "abstract": "Naming game simulates the process of naming an object by a single word, in\nwhich a population of communicating agents can reach global consensus\nasymptotically through iteratively pair-wise conversations. We propose an\nextension of the single-word model to a multi-word naming game (MWNG),\nsimulating the case of describing a complex object by a sentence (multiple\nwords). Words are defined in categories, and then organized as sentences by\ncombining them from different categories. We refer to a formatted combination\nof several words as a pattern. In such an MWNG, through a pair-wise\nconversation, it requires the hearer to achieve consensus with the speaker with\nrespect to both every single word in the sentence as well as the sentence\npattern, so as to guarantee the correct meaning of the saying, otherwise, they\nfail reaching consensus in the interaction. We validate the model in three\ntypical topologies as the underlying communication network, and employ both\nconventional and man-designed patterns in performing the MWNG.", "published": "2015-12-28 08:50:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08347v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Natural Language Inference by Tree-Based Convolution and Heuristic\n  Matching", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the TBCNN-pair model to recognize entailment and\ncontradiction between two sentences. In our model, a tree-based convolutional\nneural network (TBCNN) captures sentence-level semantics; then heuristic\nmatching layers like concatenation, element-wise product/difference combine the\ninformation in individual sentences. Experimental results show that our model\noutperforms existing sentence encoding-based approaches by a large margin.", "published": "2015-12-28 14:28:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08422v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
