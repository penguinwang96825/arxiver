{"title": "A Survey of Named Entity Recognition in Assamese and other Indian\n  Languages", "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition is always important when dealing with major Natural\nLanguage Processing tasks such as information extraction, question-answering,\nmachine translation, document summarization etc so in this paper we put forward\na survey of Named Entities in Indian Languages with particular reference to\nAssamese. There are various rule-based and machine learning approaches\navailable for Named Entity Recognition. At the very first of the paper we give\nan idea of the available approaches for Named Entity Recognition and then we\ndiscuss about the related research in this field. Assamese like other Indian\nlanguages is agglutinative and suffers from lack of appropriate resources as\nNamed Entity Recognition requires large data sets, gazetteer list, dictionary\netc and some useful feature like capitalization as found in English cannot be\nfound in Assamese. Apart from this we also describe some of the issues faced in\nAssamese while doing Named Entity Recognition.", "published": "2014-07-09 13:59:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2918v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
