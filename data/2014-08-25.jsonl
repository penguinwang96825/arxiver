{"title": "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification", "abstract": "We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNN)\ntrained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification\ntasks. We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static\nvectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning\ntask-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance.\nWe additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for\nthe use of both task-specific and static vectors. The CNN models discussed\nherein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include\nsentiment analysis and question classification.", "published": "2014-08-25 19:48:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
