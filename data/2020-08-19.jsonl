{"title": "Leveraging Historical Interaction Data for Improving Conversational Recommender System", "abstract": "Recently, conversational recommender system (CRS) has become an emerging and practical research topic. Most of the existing CRS methods focus on learning effective preference representations for users from conversation data alone. While, we take a new perspective to leverage historical interaction data for improving CRS. For this purpose, we propose a novel pre-training approach to integrating both item-based preference sequence (from historical interaction data) and attribute-based preference sequence (from conversation data) via pre-training methods. We carefully design two pre-training tasks to enhance information fusion between item- and attribute-based preference. To improve the learning performance, we further develop an effective negative sample generator which can produce high-quality negative samples. Experiment results on two real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for improving CRS.", "published": "2020-08-19 03:43:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08247v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Combinatorial diversity metrics for the analysis of policy processes", "abstract": "We present several completely general diversity metrics to quantify the problem-solving capacity of any public policy decision making process. This is performed by modelling the policy process using a declarative process paradigm in conjunction with constraints modelled by expressions in linear temporal logic. We introduce a class of traces, called first-passage traces, to represent the different executions of the declarative processes. Heuristics of what properties a diversity measure of such processes ought to satisfy are used to derive two different metrics for these processes in terms of the set of first-passage traces. These metrics turn out to have formulations in terms of the entropies of two different random variables on the set of traces of the processes. In addition, we introduce a measure of `goodness' whereby a trace is termed {\\it good} if it satisfies some prescribed linear temporal logic expression. This allows for comparisons of policy processes with respect to the prescribed notion of `goodness'.", "published": "2020-08-19 19:46:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10401v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Prescriptive Business Process Monitoring for Recommending Next Best Actions", "abstract": "Predictive business process monitoring (PBPM) techniques predict future process behaviour based on historical event log data to improve operational business processes. Concerning the next activity prediction, recent PBPM techniques use state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn predictive models for producing more accurate predictions in running process instances. Even though organisations measure process performance by key performance indicators (KPIs), the DNN`s learning procedure is not directly affected by them. Therefore, the resulting next most likely activity predictions can be less beneficial in practice. Prescriptive business process monitoring (PrBPM) approaches assess predictions regarding their impact on the process performance (typically measured by KPIs) to prevent undesired process activities by raising alarms or recommending actions. However, none of these approaches recommends actual process activities as actions that are optimised according to a given KPI. We present a PrBPM technique that transforms the next most likely activities into the next best actions regarding a given KPI. Thereby, our technique uses business process simulation to ensure the control-flow conformance of the recommended actions. Based on our evaluation with two real-life event logs, we show that our technique`s next best actions can outperform next activity predictions regarding the optimisation of a KPI and the distance from the actual process instances.", "published": "2020-08-19 22:33:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08693v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.SE"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Tractable Inference in Credal Sentential Decision Diagrams", "abstract": "Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are logic circuits where the inputs of disjunctive gates are annotated by probability values. They allow for a compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets of Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints defined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually learned from a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent inferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we develop the credal sentential decision diagrams, a generalisation of their probabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities with (so-called credal) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint credal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference algorithms are derived for these models, these allow to compute: (i) the lower and upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables; (ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single variable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic sentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the same most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation of the other variables. These inferences are tractable, as all the three algorithms, based on bottom-up traversal with local linear programming tasks on the disjunctive gates, can be solved in polynomial time with respect to the circuit size. For a first empirical validation, we consider a simple application based on noisy seven-segment display images. The credal models are observed to properly distinguish between easy and hard-to-detect instances and outperform other generative models not able to cope with logical constraints.", "published": "2020-08-19 16:04:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08524v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
