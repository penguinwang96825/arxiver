{"title": "Empirical Evaluation of Tree distances for Parser Evaluation", "abstract": "In this empirical study, I compare various tree distance measures --\noriginally developed in computational biology for the purpose of tree\ncomparison -- for the purpose of parser evaluation. I will control for the\nparser setting by comparing the automatically generated parse trees from the\nstate-of-the-art parser Charniak, 2000) with the gold-standard parse trees. The\narticle describes two different tree distance measures (RF and QD) along with\nits variants (GRF and GQD) for the purpose of parser evaluation. The article\nwill argue that RF measure captures similar information as the standard EvalB\nmetric (Sekine and Collins, 1997) and the tree edit distance (Zhang and Shasha,\n1989) applied by Tsarfaty et al. (2011). Finally, the article also provides\nempirical evidence by reporting high correlations between the different tree\ndistances and EvalB metric's scores.", "published": "2014-09-01 08:01:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0314v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate", "abstract": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine\ntranslation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural\nmachine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be\njointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this\npaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in\nimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and\npropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for\nparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,\nwithout having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new\napproach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing\nstate-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French\ntranslation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the\n(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.", "published": "2014-09-01 16:33:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473v7", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
