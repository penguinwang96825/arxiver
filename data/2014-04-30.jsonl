{"title": "Exemplar Dynamics Models of the Stability of Phonological Categories", "abstract": "We develop a model for the stability and maintenance of phonological\ncategories. Examples of phonological categories are vowel sounds such as \"i\"\nand \"e\". We model such categories as consisting of collections of labeled\nexemplars that language users store in their memory. Each exemplar is a\ndetailed memory of an instance of the linguistic entity in question. Starting\nfrom an exemplar-level model we derive integro-differential equations for the\nlong-term evolution of the density of exemplars in different portions of\nphonetic space. Using these latter equations we investigate under what\nconditions two phonological categories merge or not. Our main conclusion is\nthat for the preservation of distinct phonological categories, it is necessary\nthat anomalous speech tokens of a given category are discarded, and not merely\nstored in memory as an exemplar of another category.", "published": "2014-04-30 22:44:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0049v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD", "91F20"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
