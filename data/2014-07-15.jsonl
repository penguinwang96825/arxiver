{"title": "Controlled Natural Language Processing as Answer Set Programming: an\n  Experiment", "abstract": "Most controlled natural languages (CNLs) are processed with the help of a\npipeline architecture that relies on different software components. We\ninvestigate in this paper in an experimental way how well answer set\nprogramming (ASP) is suited as a unifying framework for parsing a CNL, deriving\na formal representation for the resulting syntax trees, and for reasoning with\nthat representation. We start from a list of input tokens in ASP notation and\nshow how this input can be transformed into a syntax tree using an ASP grammar\nand then into reified ASP rules in form of a set of facts. These facts are then\nprocessed by an ASP meta-interpreter that allows us to infer new knowledge.", "published": "2014-07-15 02:20:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2466v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
