{"title": "Feature selection using Fisher's ratio technique for automatic speech\n  recognition", "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition involves mainly two steps; feature extraction\nand classification . Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient is used as one of the\nprominent feature extraction techniques in ASR. Usually, the set of all 12 MFCC\ncoefficients is used as the feature vector in the classification step. But the\nquestion is whether the same or improved classification accuracy can be\nachieved by using a subset of 12 MFCC as feature vector. In this paper,\nFisher's ratio technique is used for selecting a subset of 12 MFCC coefficients\nthat contribute more in discriminating a pattern. The selected coefficients are\nused in classification with Hidden Markov Model algorithm. The classification\naccuracies that we get by using 12 coefficients and by using the selected\ncoefficients are compared.", "published": "2015-05-13 04:50:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03239v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
