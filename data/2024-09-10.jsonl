{"title": "Limit Order Book Simulation and Trade Evaluation with $K$-Nearest-Neighbor Resampling", "abstract": "In this paper, we show how $K$-nearest neighbor ($K$-NN) resampling, an\noff-policy evaluation method proposed in \\cite{giegrich2023k}, can be applied\nto simulate limit order book (LOB) markets and how it can be used to evaluate\nand calibrate trading strategies. Using historical LOB data, we demonstrate\nthat our simulation method is capable of recreating realistic LOB dynamics and\nthat synthetic trading within the simulation leads to a market impact in line\nwith the corresponding literature. Compared to other statistical LOB simulation\nmethods, our algorithm has theoretical convergence guarantees under general\nconditions, does not require optimization, is easy to implement and\ncomputationally efficient. Furthermore, we show that in a benchmark comparison\nour method outperforms a deep learning-based algorithm for several key\nstatistics. In the context of a LOB with pro-rata type matching, we demonstrate\nhow our algorithm can calibrate the size of limit orders for a liquidation\nstrategy. Finally, we describe how $K$-NN resampling can be modified for\nchoices of higher dimensional state spaces.", "published": "2024-09-10 13:50:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06514v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "q-fin.ST", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
