{"title": "Employee Attrition Prediction", "abstract": "We aim to predict whether an employee of a company will leave or not, using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. We use evaluation of employee performance, average monthly hours at work and number of years spent in the company, among others, as our features. Other approaches to this problem include the use of ANNs, decision trees and logistic regression. The dataset was split, using 70% for training the algorithm and 30% for testing it, achieving an accuracy of 94.32%.", "published": "2018-06-19 18:42:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10480v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
