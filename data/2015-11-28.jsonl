{"title": "Semantic Folding Theory And its Application in Semantic Fingerprinting", "abstract": "Human language is recognized as a very complex domain since decades. No\ncomputer system has been able to reach human levels of performance so far. The\nonly known computational system capable of proper language processing is the\nhuman brain. While we gather more and more data about the brain, its\nfundamental computational processes still remain obscure. The lack of a sound\ncomputational brain theory also prevents the fundamental understanding of\nNatural Language Processing. As always when science lacks a theoretical\nfoundation, statistical modeling is applied to accommodate as many sampled\nreal-world data as possible. An unsolved fundamental issue is the actual\nrepresentation of language (data) within the brain, denoted as the\nRepresentational Problem. Starting with Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal\nMemory (HTM) theory, a consistent computational theory of the human cortex, we\nhave developed a corresponding theory of language data representation: The\nSemantic Folding Theory. The process of encoding words, by using a topographic\nsemantic space as distributional reference frame into a sparse binary\nrepresentational vector is called Semantic Folding and is the central topic of\nthis document. Semantic Folding describes a method of converting language from\nits symbolic representation (text) into an explicit, semantically grounded\nrepresentation that can be generically processed by Hawkins' HTM networks. As\nit turned out, this change in representation, by itself, can solve many complex\nNLP problems by applying Boolean operators and a generic similarity function\nlike the Euclidian Distance. Many practical problems of statistical NLP\nsystems, like the high cost of computation, the fundamental incongruity of\nprecision and recall , the complex tuning procedures etc., can be elegantly\novercome by applying Semantic Folding.", "published": "2015-11-28 00:13:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08855v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "q-bio.NC"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
