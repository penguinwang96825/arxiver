{"title": "OrderFusion: Encoding Orderbook for Probabilistic Intraday Price Prediction", "abstract": "Efficient and reliable probabilistic prediction of intraday electricity\nprices is essential to manage market uncertainties and support robust trading\nstrategies. However, current methods often suffer from parameter\ninefficiencies, as they fail to fully exploit the potential of modeling\ninterdependencies between bids and offers in the orderbook, requiring a large\nnumber of parameters for representation learning. Furthermore, these methods\nface the quantile crossing issue, where upper quantiles fall below the lower\nquantiles, resulting in unreliable probabilistic predictions. To address these\ntwo challenges, we propose an encoding method called OrderFusion and design a\nhierarchical multi-quantile head. The OrderFusion encodes the orderbook into a\n2.5D representation, which is processed by a tailored jump cross-attention\nbackbone to capture the interdependencies of bids and offers, enabling\nparameter-efficient learning. The head sets the median quantile as an anchor\nand predicts multiple quantiles hierarchically, ensuring reliability by\nenforcing monotonicity between quantiles through non-negative functions.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on four price indices:\n60-min ID3, 60-min ID1, 15-min ID3, and 15-min ID1 using the German orderbook\nover three years to ensure a fair evaluation. The results confirm that our\ndesign choices improve overall performance, offering a parameter-efficient and\nreliable solution for probabilistic intraday price prediction.", "published": "2025-02-05 15:37:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06830v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "FactorGCL: A Hypergraph-Based Factor Model with Temporal Residual Contrastive Learning for Stock Returns Prediction", "abstract": "As a fundamental method in economics and finance, the factor model has been\nextensively utilized in quantitative investment. In recent years, there has\nbeen a paradigm shift from traditional linear models with expert-designed\nfactors to more flexible nonlinear machine learning-based models with\ndata-driven factors, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of these factor\nmodels. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in market data, mining\neffective factors in data-driven models remains challenging. In this work, we\npropose a hypergraph-based factor model with temporal residual contrastive\nlearning (FactorGCL) that employs a hypergraph structure to better capture\nhigh-order nonlinear relationships among stock returns and factors. To mine\nhidden factors that supplement human-designed prior factors for predicting\nstock returns, we design a cascading residual hypergraph architecture, in which\nthe hidden factors are extracted from the residual information after removing\nthe influence of prior factors. Additionally, we propose a temporal residual\ncontrastive learning method to guide the extraction of effective and\ncomprehensive hidden factors by contrasting stock-specific residual information\nover different time periods. Our extensive experiments on real stock market\ndata demonstrate that FactorGCL not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods but also mines effective hidden factors for predicting stock returns.", "published": "2025-02-05 12:37:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05218v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Efficient Triangular Arbitrage Detection via Graph Neural Networks", "abstract": "Triangular arbitrage is a profitable trading strategy in financial markets\nthat exploits discrepancies in currency exchange rates. Traditional methods for\ndetecting triangular arbitrage opportunities, such as exhaustive search\nalgorithms and linear programming solvers, often suffer from high computational\ncomplexity and may miss potential opportunities in dynamic markets. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach to triangular arbitrage detection using\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs). By representing the currency exchange network as\na graph, we leverage the powerful representation and learning capabilities of\nGNNs to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities more efficiently.\nSpecifically, we formulate the triangular arbitrage problem as a graph-based\noptimization task and design a GNN architecture that captures the complex\nrelationships between currencies and exchange rates. We introduce a relaxed\nloss function to enable more flexible learning and integrate Deep Q-Learning\nprinciples to optimize the expected returns. Our experiments on a synthetic\ndataset demonstrate that the proposed GNN-based method achieves a higher\naverage yield with significantly reduced computational time compared to\ntraditional methods. This work highlights the potential of using GNNs for\nsolving optimization problems in finance and provides a promising approach for\nreal-time arbitrage detection in dynamic financial markets.", "published": "2025-02-05 14:13:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03194v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
