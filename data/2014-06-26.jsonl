{"title": "FrameNet Resource Grammar Library for GF", "abstract": "In this paper we present an ongoing research investigating the possibility\nand potential of integrating frame semantics, particularly FrameNet, in the\nGrammatical Framework (GF) application grammar development. An important\ncomponent of GF is its Resource Grammar Library (RGL) that encapsulates the\nlow-level linguistic knowledge about morphology and syntax of currently more\nthan 20 languages facilitating rapid development of multilingual applications.\nIn the ideal case, porting a GF application grammar to a new language would\nonly require introducing the domain lexicon - translation equivalents that are\ninterlinked via common abstract terms. While it is possible for a highly\nrestricted CNL, developing and porting a less restricted CNL requires above\naverage linguistic knowledge about the particular language, and above average\nGF experience. Specifying a lexicon is mostly straightforward in the case of\nnouns (incl. multi-word units), however, verbs are the most complex category\n(in terms of both inflectional paradigms and argument structure), and adding\nthem to a GF application grammar is not a straightforward task. In this paper\nwe are focusing on verbs, investigating the possibility of creating a\nmultilingual FrameNet-based GF library. We propose an extension to the current\nRGL, allowing GF application developers to define clauses on the semantic\nlevel, thus leaving the language-specific syntactic mapping to this extension.\nWe demonstrate our approach by reengineering the MOLTO Phrasebook application\ngrammar.", "published": "2014-06-26 11:14:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6844v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
