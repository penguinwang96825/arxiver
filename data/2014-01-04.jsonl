{"title": "Properties of phoneme N -grams across the world's language families", "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the properties of phoneme N-grams across half\nof the world's languages. We investigate if the sizes of three different N-gram\ndistributions of the world's language families obey a power law. Further, the\nN-gram distributions of language families parallel the sizes of the families,\nwhich seem to obey a power law distribution. The correlation between N-gram\ndistributions and language family sizes improves with increasing values of N.\nWe applied statistical tests, originally given by physicists, to test the\nhypothesis of power law fit to twelve different datasets. The study also raises\nsome new questions about the use of N-gram distributions in linguistic\nresearch, which we answer by running a statistical test.", "published": "2014-01-04 09:50:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0794v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
