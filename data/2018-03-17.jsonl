{"title": "Experiments with Neural Networks for Small and Large Scale Authorship\n  Verification", "abstract": "We propose two models for a special case of authorship verification problem.\nThe task is to investigate whether the two documents of a given pair are\nwritten by the same author. We consider the authorship verification problem for\nboth small and large scale datasets. The underlying small-scale problem has two\nmain challenges: First, the authors of the documents are unknown to us because\nno previous writing samples are available. Second, the two documents are short\n(a few hundred to a few thousand words) and may differ considerably in the\ngenre and/or topic. To solve it we propose transformation encoder to transform\none document of the pair into the other. This document transformation generates\na loss which is used as a recognizable feature to verify if the authors of the\npair are identical. For the large scale problem where various authors are\nengaged and more examples are available with larger length, a parallel\nrecurrent neural network is proposed. It compares the language models of the\ntwo documents. We evaluate our methods on various types of datasets including\nAuthorship Identification datasets of PAN competition, Amazon reviews, and\nmachine learning articles. Experiments show that both methods achieve stable\nand competitive performance compared to the baselines.", "published": "2018-03-17 04:11:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06456v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Argumentation theory for mathematical argument", "abstract": "To adequately model mathematical arguments the analyst must be able to\nrepresent the mathematical objects under discussion and the relationships\nbetween them, as well as inferences drawn about these objects and relationships\nas the discourse unfolds.

The\nframework can recover salient elements of discourse at, and within, the\nsentence level, as well as the way mathematical content connects to form larger\nargumentative structures.

{"title": "Variational Knowledge Graph Reasoning", "abstract": "Inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KG) has attracted a lot of\nattention from the research community. In this paper, we tackle a practical\nquery answering task involving predicting the relation of a given entity pair.\nWe frame this prediction problem as an inference problem in a probabilistic\ngraphical model and aim at resolving it from a variational inference\nperspective. In order to model the relation between the query entity pair, we\nassume that there exists an underlying latent variable (paths connecting two\nnodes) in the KG, which carries the equivalent semantics of their relations.\nHowever, due to the intractability of connections in large KGs, we propose to\nuse variation inference to maximize the evidence lower bound. More\nspecifically, our framework (\\textsc{Diva}) is composed of three modules, i.e.\na posterior approximator, a prior (path finder), and a likelihood (path\nreasoner). By using variational inference, we are able to incorporate them\nclosely into a unified architecture and jointly optimize them to perform KG\nreasoning. With active interactions among these sub-modules, \\textsc{Diva} is\nbetter at handling noise and coping with more complex reasoning scenarios. In\norder to evaluate our method, we conduct the experiment of the link prediction\ntask on multiple datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances on both\ndatasets.", "published": "2018-03-17 22:08:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06581v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Spectral Estimation of Plasma Fluctuations II: Nonstationary Analysis of\n  ELM Spectra", "abstract": "Several analysis methods for nonstationary fluctuations are described and\napplied to the edge localized mode (ELM) instabilities of limiter H-mode\nplasmas. The microwave scattering diagnostic observes poloidal $k_{\\theta}$\nvalues of 3.3 cm$^{-1}$, averaged over a 20 cm region at the plasma edge.A\nshort autoregressive filter enhances the nonstationary component of the plasma\nfluctuations by removing much of the background level of stationary\nfluctuations. Between ELMs, the spectrum predominantly consists of broad-banded\n300-700 kHz fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic drift\ndirection, indicating the presence of a negative electric field near the plasma\nedge. The time-frequency spectrogram is computed with the multiple taper\ntechnique. By using the singular value decomposition of the spectrogram, it is\nshown that the spectrum during the ELM is broader and more symmetric than that\nof the stationary spectrum. The ELM period and the evolution of the spectrum\nbetween ELMs varies from discharge to discharge. For the discharge under\nconsideration which has distinct ELMs with a 1 msec period, the spectrum has a\nmaximum in the electron drift direction which relaxes to a near constant value\n%its characteristic shape in the first half millisecond after the end of the\nELM and then grows slowly. In contrast, the level of the fluctuations in the\nion drift direction increases exponentially by a factor of eight in the five\nmilliseconds~after the ELM. High frequency precursors are found which occur one\nmillisecond before the ELMs and propagate in the ion drift direction. These\nprecursors are very short ($\\sim 10 \\mu$secs), coherent bursts, and they\npredict the occurrence of an ELM with a high success rate.", "published": "2018-03-17 03:56:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06452v2", "categories": ["physics.plasm-ph", "eess.AS", "physics.data-an", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "physics.plasm-ph"}
