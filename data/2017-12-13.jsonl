{"title": "A User-Study on Online Adaptation of Neural Machine Translation to Human\n  Post-Edits", "abstract": "The advantages of neural machine translation (NMT) have been extensively\nvalidated for offline translation of several language pairs for different\ndomains of spoken and written language. However, research on interactive\nlearning of NMT by adaptation to human post-edits has so far been confined to\nsimulation experiments. We present the first user study on online adaptation of\nNMT to user post-edits in the domain of patent translation. Our study involves\n29 human subjects (translation students) whose post-editing effort and\ntranslation quality were measured on about 4,500 interactions of a human\npost-editor and a machine translation system integrating an online adaptive\nlearning algorithm. Our experimental results show a significant reduction of\nhuman post-editing effort due to online adaptation in NMT according to several\nevaluation metrics, including hTER, hBLEU, and KSMR. Furthermore, we found\nsignificant improvements in BLEU/TER between NMT outputs and professional\ntranslations in granted patents, providing further evidence for the advantages\nof online adaptive NMT in an interactive setup.", "published": "2017-12-13 16:41:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04853v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Differentiable lower bound for expected BLEU score", "abstract": "In natural language processing tasks performance of the models is often\nmeasured with some non-differentiable metric, such as BLEU score. To use\nefficient gradient-based methods for optimization, it is a common workaround to\noptimize some surrogate loss function. This approach is effective if\noptimization of such loss also results in improving target metric. The\ncorresponding problem is referred to as loss-evaluation mismatch. In the\npresent work we propose a method for calculation of differentiable lower bound\nof expected BLEU score that does not involve computationally expensive sampling\nprocedure such as the one required when using REINFORCE rule from reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework.", "published": "2017-12-13 11:17:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04708v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "A Multimodal Corpus of Expert Gaze and Behavior during Phonetic\n  Segmentation Tasks", "abstract": "Phonetic segmentation is the process of splitting speech into distinct\nphonetic units. Human experts routinely perform this task manually by analyzing\nauditory and visual cues using analysis software, which is an extremely\ntime-consuming process. Methods exist for automatic segmentation, but these are\nnot always accurate enough. In order to improve automatic segmentation, we need\nto model it as close to the manual segmentation as possible. This corpus is an\neffort to capture the human segmentation behavior by recording experts\nperforming a segmentation task. We believe that this data will enable us to\nhighlight the important aspects of manual segmentation, which can be used in\nautomatic segmentation to improve its accuracy.", "published": "2017-12-13 14:45:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04798v3", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
