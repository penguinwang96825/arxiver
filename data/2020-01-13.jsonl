{"title": "OMAP-L138 LCDK Development Kit", "abstract": "Low cost and low power consumption processor play a vital role in the field of Digital Signal Processing (DSP). The OMAP-L138 development kit which is low cost, low power consumption, ease and speed, with a wide variety of applications includes Digital signal processing, Image processing and video processing. This paper represents the basic introduction to OMAP-L138 processor and quick procedural steps for real time and non-real time implementations with a set of programs. The real time experiments are based on audio in the applications of audio loopback, delay and echo. Whereas the non-real time experiments are generation of a sine wave, low pass and high pass filter.", "published": "2020-01-13 13:09:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10094v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
