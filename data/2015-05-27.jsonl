{"title": "Unsupervised Cross-Domain Word Representation Learning", "abstract": "Meaning of a word varies from one domain to another. Despite this important\ndomain dependence in word semantics, existing word representation learning\nmethods are bound to a single domain. Given a pair of\n\\emph{source}-\\emph{target} domains, we propose an unsupervised method for\nlearning domain-specific word representations that accurately capture the\ndomain-specific aspects of word semantics. First, we select a subset of\nfrequent words that occur in both domains as \\emph{pivots}. Next, we optimize\nan objective function that enforces two constraints: (a) for both source and\ntarget domain documents, pivots that appear in a document must accurately\npredict the co-occurring non-pivots, and (b) word representations learnt for\npivots must be similar in the two domains. Moreover, we propose a method to\nperform domain adaptation using the learnt word representations. Our proposed\nmethod significantly outperforms competitive baselines including the\nstate-of-the-art domain-insensitive word representations, and reports best\nsentiment classification accuracies for all domain-pairs in a benchmark\ndataset.", "published": "2015-05-27 04:02:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07184v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Unveiling the Political Agenda of the European Parliament Plenary: A\n  Topical Analysis", "abstract": "This study analyzes political interactions in the European Parliament (EP) by\nconsidering how the political agenda of the plenary sessions has evolved over\ntime and the manner in which Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have\nreacted to external and internal stimuli when making Parliamentary speeches. It\ndoes so by considering the context in which speeches are made, and the content\nof those speeches. To detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time,\nspeech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method, based on\ntwo layers of matrix factorization. This method is applied to a new corpus of\nall English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period\n1999-2014. Our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP has evolved\nsignificantly over time, is impacted upon by the committee structure of the\nParliament, and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the\nemergence of the Euro-crisis have a significant impact on what is being\ndiscussed in Parliament.", "published": "2015-05-27 13:17:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07302v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
