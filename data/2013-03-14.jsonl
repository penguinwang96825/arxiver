{"title": "Expressing Ethnicity through Behaviors of a Robot Character", "abstract": "Achieving homophily, or association based on similarity, between a human user\nand a robot holds a promise of improved perception and task performance.\nHowever, no previous studies that address homophily via ethnic similarity with\nrobots exist. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties of evoking ethnic cues\nin a robot, as opposed to a virtual agent, and an approach to overcome those\ndifficulties based on using ethnically salient behaviors. We outline our\nmethodology for selecting and evaluating such behaviors, and culminate with a\nstudy that evaluates our hypotheses of the possibility of ethnic attribution of\na robot character through verbal and nonverbal behaviors and of achieving the\nhomophily effect.", "published": "2013-03-14 20:07:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3592v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
