{"title": "Keyphrase Based Evaluation of Automatic Text Summarization", "abstract": "The development of methods to deal with the informative contents of the text\nunits in the matching process is a major challenge in automatic summary\nevaluation systems that use fixed n-gram matching. The limitation causes\ninaccurate matching between units in a peer and reference summaries. The\npresent study introduces a new Keyphrase based Summary Evaluator KpEval for\nevaluating automatic summaries. The KpEval relies on the keyphrases since they\nconvey the most important concepts of a text. In the evaluation process, the\nkeyphrases are used in their lemma form as the matching text unit. The system\nwas applied to evaluate different summaries of Arabic multi-document data set\npresented at TAC2011. The results showed that the new evaluation technique\ncorrelates well with the known evaluation systems: Rouge1, Rouge2, RougeSU4,\nand AutoSummENG MeMoG. KpEval has the strongest correlation with AutoSummENG\nMeMoG, Pearson and spearman correlation coefficient measures are 0.8840, 0.9667\nrespectively.", "published": "2015-05-22 21:12:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06228v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "94AXX"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Weakly-Supervised Alignment of Video With Text", "abstract": "Suppose that we are given a set of videos, along with natural language\ndescriptions in the form of multiple sentences (e.g., manual annotations, movie\nscripts, sport summaries etc.), and that these sentences appear in the same\ntemporal order as their visual counterparts. We propose in this paper a method\nfor aligning the two modalities, i.e., automatically providing a time stamp for\nevery sentence. Given vectorial features for both video and text, we propose to\ncast this task as a temporal assignment problem, with an implicit linear\nmapping between the two feature modalities. We formulate this problem as an\ninteger quadratic program, and solve its continuous convex relaxation using an\nefficient conditional gradient algorithm. Several rounding procedures are\nproposed to construct the final integer solution. After demonstrating\nsignificant improvements over the state of the art on the related task of\naligning video with symbolic labels [7], we evaluate our method on a\nchallenging dataset of videos with associated textual descriptions [36], using\nboth bag-of-words and continuous representations for text.", "published": "2015-05-22 11:08:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06027v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Learning Dynamic Feature Selection for Fast Sequential Prediction", "abstract": "We present paired learning and inference algorithms for significantly\nreducing computation and increasing speed of the vector dot products in the\nclassifiers that are at the heart of many NLP components. This is accomplished\nby partitioning the features into a sequence of templates which are ordered\nsuch that high confidence can often be reached using only a small fraction of\nall features. Parameter estimation is arranged to maximize accuracy and early\nconfidence in this sequence. Our approach is simpler and better suited to NLP\nthan other related cascade methods. We present experiments in left-to-right\npart-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and transition-based\ndependency parsing. On the typical benchmarking datasets we can preserve POS\ntagging accuracy above 97% and parsing LAS above 88.5% both with over a\nfive-fold reduction in run-time, and NER F1 above 88 with more than 2x increase\nin speed.", "published": "2015-05-22 18:28:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06169v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
