{"title": "A Lagrangian Relaxation for the Maximum Stable Set Problem", "abstract": "We propose a new integer programming formulation for the problem of finding a maximum stable set of a graph based on representatives of stable sets. In addition, we investigate exact solutions provided by a Lagrangian decomposition of this formulation in which only one constraint is relaxed. Some computational experiments were carried out with an effective multi-threaded implementation of our algorithm in a multi-core system, and their results are presented.", "published": "2009-03-08 12:08:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.1407v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
