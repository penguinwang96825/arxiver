Existing approaches\noften struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained\ncontrollability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel\nthree-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent\nspace control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach\nbegins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both\nreasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and\nreasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust\nbehavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.\nWe then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP\nactivations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,\nattack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to\nlearn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial\ncharacteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted\nmanipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective\nrefusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving\nhelpfulness for legitimate use cases.

Although\nregression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference\ntasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds,\nstrategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under\nthreshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending\ndistribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers\nstrategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those\nunaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach\nconsisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a\nsample around the threshold.

We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes.

This challenge is especially pertinent\nfor MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this\nstudy, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow\ndetection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.\nCloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened\nout as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the\nquantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques\nincluding Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),\nwith advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel\nAttention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods\nstruggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the\ndetection of clouds and cloud shadows.

{"title": "Ads that Stick: Near-Optimal Ad Optimization through Psychological Behavior Models", "abstract": "Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital\nadvertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling\npolicies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,\nthat overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'\nlong-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several\npsychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).\n  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on\nthree key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and\noperant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings.

In this perspective, we introduce\na bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM\nsystems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under\nrealistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median\nenergy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200\nbillion parameters).

Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions.

Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a\n``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for\nexisting contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.\nUsing this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several\ndiagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether\nstrong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an\nability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that\nperformance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not\nexist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives\nfrom inferring this clinical context.

However, most of the existing literature relies on idealized models\nfor the DMA operation, often overlooking critical structural and physical\nconstraints inherent to their constituent metamaterials. In this paper,\nleveraging a recently proposed model for this antenna architecture\nincorporating physically consistent modeling of mutual coupling and waveguide\npropagation losses, we optimize DMA-based transmission for bistatic sensing. A\ntractable approximation for the DMA response is first presented, which enables\nefficient optimization of the dynamically reconfigurable Lorentzian-constrained\nresponses of the array's metamaterials. In particular, we formulate a robust\nbeamforming optimization problem with the objective to minimize the worst-case\nposition error bound, in the presence of spatial uncertainties for the\nenvironment's scatterers as well as synchronization uncertainties at the analog\ncombining multi-antenna receiver. To address the resulting high computational\ncomplexity due to the possibly excessive number of metamaterial-based antennas\nand their operation constraints, two low complexity beamforming design\napproaches are presented that perform offline searching over a novel beam\ncodebook. The accuracy of all presented DMA designs is assessed by means of\nMonte Carlo simulations for various system parameters, confirming that\naccurately modeling mutual coupling is essential for maintaining increased\nlocalization performance. It is also shown that, even under positioning and\nsynchronization uncertainties, the proposed designs yield accuracy comparable\nto their fully digital and analog counterparts, while adhering to the\nstructural DMA constraints.", "published": "2025-09-24 06:36:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19801v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Timeliness-Aware Joint Source and Channel Coding for Adaptive Image Transmission", "abstract": "Accurate and timely image transmission is critical for emerging\ntime-sensitive applications such as remote sensing in satellite-assisted\nInternet of Things. However, the bandwidth limitation poses a significant\nchallenge in existing wireless systems, making it difficult to fulfill the\nrequirements of both high-fidelity and low-latency image transmission. Semantic\ncommunication is expected to break through the performance bottleneck by\nfocusing on the transmission of goal-oriented semantic information rather than\nraw data. In this paper, we employ a new timeliness metric named the value of\ninformation (VoI) and propose an adaptive joint source and channel coding\n(JSCC) method for image transmission that simultaneously considers both\nreconstruction quality and timeliness. Specifically, we first design a JSCC\nframework for image transmission with adaptive code length. Next, we formulate\na VoI maximization problem by optimizing the transmission code length of the\nadaptive JSCC under the reconstruction quality constraint. Then, a deep\nreinforcement learning-based algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization\nproblem efficiently. Experimental results show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of reconstruction quality\nand timeliness, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, offering\na promising solution for efficient and robust image transmission in\ntime-sensitive wireless networks.", "published": "2025-09-24 04:09:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19754v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
