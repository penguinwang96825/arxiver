{"title": "Efficient Least Squares Monte-Carlo Technique for PFE/EE Calculations", "abstract": "We describe a regression-based method, generally referred to as the Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method, to speed up exposure calculations of a portfolio. We assume that the portfolio contains several exotic derivatives that are priced using Monte-Carlo on each real world scenario and time step. Such a setting is often referred to as a Monte Carlo over a Monte Carlo or a Nested Monte Carlo method.", "published": "2021-05-14 20:31:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07061v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
