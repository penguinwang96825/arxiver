{"title": "Local System Voting Feature for Machine Translation System Combination", "abstract": "In this paper, we enhance the traditional confusion network system\ncombination approach with an additional model trained by a neural network. This\nwork is motivated by the fact that the commonly used binary system voting\nmodels only assign each input system a global weight which is responsible for\nthe global impact of each input system on all translations. This prevents\nindividual systems with low system weights from having influence on the system\ncombination output, although in some situations this could be helpful. Further,\nwords which have only been seen by one or few systems rarely have a chance of\nbeing present in the combined output. We train a local system voting model by a\nneural network which is based on the words themselves and the combinatorial\noccurrences of the different system outputs. This gives system combination the\noption to prefer other systems at different word positions even for the same\nsentence.", "published": "2017-02-10 01:27:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03033v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Universal Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "Universal Dependencies (UD) offer a uniform cross-lingual syntactic\nrepresentation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications. Recent\nwork shows that semantic parsing can be accomplished by transforming syntactic\ndependencies to logical forms. However, this work is limited to English, and\ncannot process dependency graphs, which allow handling complex phenomena such\nas control. In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a semantic interface for UD,\nwhich maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent\nfashion and can process dependency graphs. We perform experiments on question\nanswering against Freebase and provide German and Spanish translations of the\nWebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets to facilitate multilingual evaluation.\nResults show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and\ndatasets. For English, it achieves a 4.9 F1 point improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art on GraphQuestions.

{"title": "Universal Dependencies to Logical Forms with Negation Scope", "abstract": "Many language technology applications would benefit from the ability to\nrepresent negation and its scope on top of widely-used linguistic resources. In\nthis paper, we investigate the possibility of obtaining a first-order logic\nrepresentation with negation scope marked using Universal Dependencies. To do\nso, we enhance UDepLambda, a framework that converts dependency graphs to\nlogical forms. The resulting UDepLambda$\\lnot$ is able to handle phenomena\nrelated to scope by means of an higher-order type theory, relevant not only to\nnegation but also to universal quantification and other complex semantic\nphenomena. The initial conversion we did for English is promising, in that one\ncan represent the scope of negation also in the presence of more complex\nphenomena such as universal quantifiers.", "published": "2017-02-10 19:16:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03305v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "03B65"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Concept Embeddings for Efficient Bag-of-Concepts Densification", "abstract": "Explicit concept space models have proven efficacy for text representation in\nmany natural language and text mining applications. The idea is to embed\ntextual structures into a semantic space of concepts which captures the main\nideas, objects, and the characteristics of these structures. The so called Bag\nof Concepts (BoC) representation suffers from data sparsity causing low\nsimilarity scores between similar texts due to low concept overlap. To address\nthis problem, we propose two neural embedding models to learn continuous\nconcept vectors. Once they are learned, we propose an efficient vector\naggregation method to generate fully continuous BoC representations. We\nevaluate our concept embedding models on three tasks: 1) measuring entity\nsemantic relatedness and ranking where we achieve 1.6% improvement in\ncorrelation scores, 2) dataless concept categorization where we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance and reduce the categorization error rate by more\nthan 5% compared to five prior word and entity embedding models, and 3)\ndataless document classification where our models outperform the sparse BoC\nrepresentations. In addition, by exploiting our efficient linear time vector\naggregation method, we achieve better accuracy scores with much less concept\ndimensions compared to previous BoC densification methods which operate in\npolynomial time and require hundreds of dimensions in the BoC representation.", "published": "2017-02-10 22:44:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03342v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
