{"title": "Yara Parser: A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser", "abstract": "Dependency parsers are among the most crucial tools in natural language\nprocessing as they have many important applications in downstream tasks such as\ninformation retrieval, machine translation and knowledge acquisition. We\nintroduce the Yara Parser, a fast and accurate open-source dependency parser\nbased on the arc-eager algorithm and beam search. It achieves an unlabeled\naccuracy of 93.32 on the standard WSJ test set which ranks it among the top\ndependency parsers. At its fastest, Yara can parse about 4000 sentences per\nsecond when in greedy mode (1 beam). When optimizing for accuracy (using 64\nbeams and Brown cluster features), Yara can parse 45 sentences per second. The\nparser can be trained on any syntactic dependency treebank and different\noptions are provided in order to make it more flexible and tunable for specific\ntasks. It is released with the Apache version 2.0 license and can be used for\nboth commercial and academic purposes. The parser can be found at\nhttps://github.com/yahoo/YaraParser.", "published": "2015-03-23 17:20:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06733v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Unsupervised POS Induction with Word Embeddings", "abstract": "Unsupervised word embeddings have been shown to be valuable as features in\nsupervised learning problems; however, their role in unsupervised problems has\nbeen less thoroughly explored. In this paper, we show that embeddings can\nlikewise add value to the problem of unsupervised POS induction. In two\nrepresentative models of POS induction, we replace multinomial distributions\nover the vocabulary with multivariate Gaussian distributions over word\nembeddings and observe consistent improvements in eight languages. We also\nanalyze the effect of various choices while inducing word embeddings on\n\"downstream\" POS induction results.", "published": "2015-03-23 18:32:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06760v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
