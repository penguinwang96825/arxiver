{"title": "Stack Exchange Tagger", "abstract": "The goal of our project is to develop an accurate tagger for questions posted\non Stack Exchange. Our problem is an instance of the more general problem of\ndeveloping accurate classifiers for large scale text datasets. We are tackling\nthe multilabel classification problem where each item (in this case, question)\ncan belong to multiple classes (in this case, tags). We are predicting the tags\n(or keywords) for a particular Stack Exchange post given only the question text\nand the title of the post. In the process, we compare the performance of\nSupport Vector Classification (SVC) for different kernel functions, loss\nfunction, etc. We found linear SVC with Crammer Singer technique produces best\nresults.", "published": "2015-12-13 17:52:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04092v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
