{"title": "Risk forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Networks", "abstract": "This work aims to implement Long Short-Term Memory mixture density networks\n(LSTM-MDNs) for Value-at-Risk forecasting and compare their performance with\nestablished models (historical simulation, CMM, and GARCH) using a defined\nbacktesting procedure. The focus was on the neural network's ability to capture\nvolatility clustering and its real-world applicability. Three architectures\nwere tested: a 2-component mixture density network, a regularized 2-component\nmodel (Arimond et al., 2020), and a 3-component mixture model, the latter being\ntested for the first time in Value-at-Risk forecasting.\n  Backtesting was performed on three stock indices (FTSE 100, S&P 500, EURO\nSTOXX 50) over two distinct two-year periods (2017-2018 as a calm period,\n2021-2022 as turbulent). Model performance was assessed through unconditional\ncoverage and independence assumption tests. The neural network's ability to\nhandle volatility clustering was validated via correlation analysis and\ngraphical evaluation.\n  Results show limited success for the neural network approach. LSTM-MDNs\nperformed poorly for 2017/2018 but outperformed benchmark models in 2021/2022.\nThe LSTM mechanism allowed the neural network to capture volatility clustering\nsimilarly to GARCH models. However, several issues were identified: the need\nfor proper model initialization and reliance on large datasets for effective\nlearning. The findings suggest that while LSTM-MDNs provide adequate risk\nforecasts, further research and adjustments are necessary for stable\nperformance.", "published": "2025-01-02 14:21:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01278v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Model of an Open, Decentralized Computational Network with Incentive-Based Load Balancing", "abstract": "This paper proposes a model that enables permissionless and decentralized\nnetworks for complex computations. We explore the integration and optimize load\nbalancing in an open, decentralized computational network. Our model leverages\neconomic incentives and reputation-based mechanisms to dynamically allocate\ntasks between operators and coprocessors. This approach eliminates the need for\nspecialized hardware or software, thereby reducing operational costs and\ncomplexities. We present a mathematical model that enhances restaking processes\nin blockchain systems by enabling operators to delegate complex tasks to\ncoprocessors. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental\nsimulations, showcasing its ability to optimize reward distribution, enhance\nsecurity, and improve operational efficiency.\n  Our approach facilitates a more flexible and scalable network through the use\nof economic commitments, adaptable dynamic rating models, and a coprocessor\nload incentivization system. Supported by experimental simulations, the model\ndemonstrates its capability to optimize resource allocation, enhance system\nresilience, and reduce operational risks. This ensures significant improvements\nin both security and cost-efficiency for the blockchain ecosystem.", "published": "2025-01-02 12:05:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01219v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.DS", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Position building in competition is a game with incomplete information", "abstract": "This paper examines strategic trading under incomplete information, where\nfirms lack full knowledge of key aspects of their competitors' trading\nstrategies such as target sizes and market impact models. We extend previous\nwork on competitive trading equilibria by incorporating uncertainty through the\nframework of Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze scenarios where firms\nhave diverse beliefs about market conditions and each other's strategies. We\nderive optimal trading strategies in this setting and demonstrate how\nuncertainty significantly impacts these strategies compared to the complete\ninformation case.\n  Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to model the presence of\nnon-strategic traders, even when strategic firms disagree on their\ncharacteristics. Our analysis reveals the complex interplay of beliefs and\nstrategic adjustments required in such an environment. Finally, we discuss\nlimitations of the current model, including the reliance on linear market\nimpact and the lack of dynamic strategy adjustments, outlining directions for\nfuture research.", "published": "2025-01-02 13:00:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01241v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
