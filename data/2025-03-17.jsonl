{"title": "Deep Hedging of Green PPAs in Electricity Markets", "abstract": "In power markets, Green Power Purchase Agreements have become an important\ncontractual tool of the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable\nsources such as wind or solar radiation. Trading Green PPAs exposes agents to\nprice risks and weather risks. Also, developed electricity markets feature the\nso-called cannibalisation effect : large infeeds induce low prices and vice\nversa. As weather is a non-tradable entity the question arises how to hedge and\nrisk-manage in this highly incom-plete setting. We propose a ''deep hedging''\nframework utilising machine learning methods to construct hedging strategies.\nThe resulting strategies outperform static and dynamic benchmark strategies\nwith respect to different risk measures.", "published": "2025-03-17 11:02:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13056v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Model-independent upper bounds for the prices of Bermudan options with convex payoffs", "abstract": "Suppose $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are probability measures on $\\mathbb R$ satisfying\n$\\mu \\leq_{cx} \\nu$.

A key finding is that the canonical set-up in which the\nfiltration is that generated by $Z$ is not rich enough to define an optimal\nmodel and additional randomisation is required. This holds even though the\nmarginal laws $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are atom-free.\n  The problem has an interpretation of finding the robust, or model-free,\nno-arbitrage bound on the price of a Bermudan option with two possible exercise\ndates, given the prices of co-maturing European options.", "published": "2025-03-17 16:07:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13328v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR", "60G40, 60G42, 91G20"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
