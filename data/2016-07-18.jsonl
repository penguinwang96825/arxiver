{"title": "Dependency Language Models for Transition-based Dependency Parsing", "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to improve the accuracy of a strong\ntransition-based dependency parser by exploiting dependency language models\nthat are extracted from a large parsed corpus. We integrated a small number of\nfeatures based on the dependency language models into the parser. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we evaluate our parser\non standard English and Chinese data where the base parser could achieve\ncompetitive accuracy scores. Our enhanced parser achieved state-of-the-art\naccuracy on Chinese data and competitive results on English data. We gained a\nlarge absolute improvement of one point (UAS) on Chinese and 0.5 points for\nEnglish.", "published": "2016-07-18 09:04:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04982v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Language classification from bilingual word embedding graphs", "abstract": "We study the role of the second language in bilingual word embeddings in\nmonolingual semantic evaluation tasks. We find strongly and weakly positive\ncorrelations between down-stream task performance and second language\nsimilarity to the target language. Additionally, we show how bilingual word\nembeddings can be employed for the task of semantic language classification and\nthat joint semantic spaces vary in meaningful ways across second languages. Our\nresults support the hypothesis that semantic language similarity is influenced\nby both structural similarity as well as geography/contact.", "published": "2016-07-18 10:59:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05014v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Joint Event Detection and Entity Resolution: a Virtuous Cycle", "abstract": "Clustering web documents has numerous applications, such as aggregating news\narticles into meaningful events, detecting trends and hot topics on the Web,\npreserving diversity in search results, etc. At the same time, the importance\nof named entities and, in particular, the ability to recognize them and to\nsolve the associated co-reference resolution problem are widely recognized as\nkey enabling factors when mining, aggregating and comparing content on the Web.\n  Instead of considering these two problems separately, we propose in this\npaper a method that tackles jointly the problem of clustering news articles\ninto events and cross-document co-reference resolution of named entities. The\nco-occurrence of named entities in the same clusters is used as an additional\nsignal to decide whether two referents should be merged into one entity. These\nrefined entities can in turn be used as enhanced features to re-cluster the\ndocuments and then be refined again, entering into a virtuous cycle that\nimproves simultaneously the performances of both tasks. We implemented a\nprototype system and report results using the TDT5 collection of news articles,\ndemonstrating the potential of our approach.", "published": "2016-07-18 15:51:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05142v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Neural Machine Translation with Recurrent Attention Modeling", "abstract": "Knowing which words have been attended to in previous time steps while\ngenerating a translation is a rich source of information for predicting what\nwords will be attended to in the future. We improve upon the attention model of\nBahdanau et al. (2014) by explicitly modeling the relationship between previous\nand subsequent attention levels for each word using one recurrent network per\ninput word. This architecture easily captures informative features, such as\nfertility and regularities in relative distortion. In experiments, we show our\nparameterization of attention improves translation quality.", "published": "2016-07-18 14:44:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05108v1", "categories": ["cs.NE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.NE"}
{"title": "Is spoken language all-or-nothing? Implications for future speech-based\n  human-machine interaction", "abstract": "Recent years have seen significant market penetration for voice-based\npersonal assistants such as Apple's Siri. However, despite this success, user\ntake-up is frustratingly low. This position paper argues that there is a\nhabitability gap caused by the inevitable mismatch between the capabilities and\nexpectations of human users and the features and benefits provided by\ncontemporary technology. Suggestions are made as to how such problems might be\nmitigated, but a more worrisome question emerges: \"is spoken language\nall-or-nothing\"? The answer, based on contemporary views on the special nature\nof (spoken) language, is that there may indeed be a fundamental limit to the\ninteraction that can take place between mismatched interlocutors (such as\nhumans and machines). However, it is concluded that interactions between native\nand non-native speakers, or between adults and children, or even between humans\nand dogs, might provide critical inspiration for the design of future\nspeech-based human-machine interaction.", "published": "2016-07-18 16:44:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05174v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
