{"title": "Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data: A Survey of Techniques", "abstract": "With the advancement of web technology and its growth, there is a huge volume\nof data present in the web for internet users and a lot of data is generated\ntoo. Internet has become a platform for online learning, exchanging ideas and\nsharing opinions. Social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google+ are\nrapidly gaining popularity as they allow people to share and express their\nviews about topics,have discussion with different communities, or post messages\nacross the world. There has been lot of work in the field of sentiment analysis\nof twitter data. This survey focuses mainly on sentiment analysis of twitter\ndata which is helpful to analyze the information in the tweets where opinions\nare highly unstructured, heterogeneous and are either positive or negative, or\nneutral in some cases. In this paper, we provide a survey and a comparative\nanalyses of existing techniques for opinion mining like machine learning and\nlexicon-based approaches, together with evaluation metrics. Using various\nmachine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Max Entropy, and Support Vector\nMachine, we provide a research on twitter data streams.General challenges and\napplications of Sentiment Analysis on Twitter are also discussed in this paper.", "published": "2016-01-26 10:44:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06971v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Recurrent Neural Network Postfilters for Statistical Parametric Speech\n  Synthesis", "abstract": "In the last two years, there have been numerous papers that have looked into\nusing Deep Neural Networks to replace the acoustic model in traditional\nstatistical parametric speech synthesis. However, far less attention has been\npaid to approaches like DNN-based postfiltering where DNNs work in conjunction\nwith traditional acoustic models. In this paper, we investigate the use of\nRecurrent Neural Networks as a potential postfilter for synthesis. We explore\nthe possibility of replacing existing postfilters, as well as highlight the\nease with which arbitrary new features can be added as input to the postfilter.\nWe also tried a novel approach of jointly training the Classification And\nRegression Tree and the postfilter, rather than the traditional approach of\ntraining them independently.", "published": "2016-01-26 22:53:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07215v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

The\ninput is a text from speech conversations with noise, and the output a compact\ntext summary. Our results, on the pilot task CCCS Multiling 2015 French corpus\nare very encouraging", "published": "2016-01-26 18:19:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07124v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
