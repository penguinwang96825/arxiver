{"title": "MacroHFT: Memory Augmented Context-aware Reinforcement Learning On High Frequency Trading", "abstract": "High-frequency trading (HFT) that executes algorithmic trading in short time\nscales, has recently occupied the majority of cryptocurrency market. Besides\ntraditional quantitative trading methods, reinforcement learning (RL) has\nbecome another appealing approach for HFT due to its terrific ability of\nhandling high-dimensional financial data and solving sophisticated sequential\ndecision-making problems, \\emph{e.g.,} hierarchical reinforcement learning\n(HRL) has shown its promising performance on second-level HFT by training a\nrouter to select only one sub-agent from the agent pool to execute the current\ntransaction. However, existing RL methods for HFT still have some defects: 1)\nstandard RL-based trading agents suffer from the overfitting issue, preventing\nthem from making effective policy adjustments based on financial context; 2)\ndue to the rapid changes in market conditions, investment decisions made by an\nindividual agent are usually one-sided and highly biased, which might lead to\nsignificant loss in extreme markets. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Memory Augmented Context-aware Reinforcement learning method On HFT,\n\\emph{a.k.a.} MacroHFT, which consists of two training phases: 1) we first\ntrain multiple types of sub-agents with the market data decomposed according to\nvarious financial indicators, specifically market trend and volatility, where\neach agent owns a conditional adapter to adjust its trading policy according to\nmarket conditions; 2) then we train a hyper-agent to mix the decisions from\nthese sub-agents and output a consistently profitable meta-policy to handle\nrapid market fluctuations, equipped with a memory mechanism to enhance the\ncapability of decision-making. Extensive experiments on various cryptocurrency\nmarkets demonstrate that MacroHFT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nminute-level trading tasks.", "published": "2024-06-20 17:48:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14537v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
