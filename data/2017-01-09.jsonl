{"title": "Neural Personalized Response Generation as Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the personalized response generation for\nconversational systems. Based on the sequence to sequence learning, especially\nthe encoder-decoder framework, we propose a two-phase approach, namely\ninitialization then adaptation, to model the responding style of human and then\ngenerate personalized responses. For evaluation, we propose a novel human aided\nmethod to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generation\nmodels by online real-time conversation and offline human judgement. Moreover,\nthe lexical divergence of the responses generated by the 5 personalized models\nindicates that the proposed two-phase approach achieves good results on\nmodeling the responding style of human and generating personalized responses\nfor the conversational systems.", "published": "2017-01-09 06:42:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02073v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Task-Specific Attentive Pooling of Phrase Alignments Contributes to\n  Sentence Matching", "abstract": "This work studies comparatively two typical sentence matching tasks: textual\nentailment (TE) and answer selection (AS), observing that weaker phrase\nalignments are more critical in TE, while stronger phrase alignments deserve\nmore attention in AS. The key to reach this observation lies in phrase\ndetection, phrase representation, phrase alignment, and more importantly how to\nconnect those aligned phrases of different matching degrees with the final\nclassifier. Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase generation and\nrepresentation, or (ii) conducts alignment at word and phrase levels by\nhandcrafted features or (iii) utilizes a single framework of alignment without\nconsidering the characteristics of specific tasks, which limits the framework's\neffectiveness across tasks. We propose an architecture based on Gated Recurrent\nUnit that supports (i) representation learning of phrases of arbitrary\ngranularity and (ii) task-specific attentive pooling of phrase alignments\nbetween two sentences. Experimental results on TE and AS match our observation\nand show the effectiveness of our approach.", "published": "2017-01-09 12:03:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02149v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Crowdsourcing Ground Truth for Medical Relation Extraction", "abstract": "Cognitive computing systems require human labeled data for evaluation, and\noften for training. The standard practice used in gathering this data minimizes\ndisagreement between annotators, and we have found this results in data that\nfails to account for the ambiguity inherent in language. We have proposed the\nCrowdTruth method for collecting ground truth through crowdsourcing, that\nreconsiders the role of people in machine learning based on the observation\nthat disagreement between annotators provides a useful signal for phenomena\nsuch as ambiguity in the text. We report on using this method to build an\nannotated data set for medical relation extraction for the $cause$ and $treat$\nrelations, and how this data performed in a supervised training experiment. We\ndemonstrate that by modeling ambiguity, labeled data gathered from crowd\nworkers can (1) reach the level of quality of domain experts for this task\nwhile reducing the cost, and (2) provide better training data at scale than\ndistant supervision. We further propose and validate new weighted measures for\nprecision, recall, and F-measure, that account for ambiguity in both human and\nmachine performance on this task.", "published": "2017-01-09 14:13:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02185v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Just an Update on PMING Distance for Web-based Semantic Similarity in\n  Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining", "abstract": "One of the main problems that emerges in the classic approach to semantics is\nthe difficulty in acquisition and maintenance of ontologies and semantic\nannotations. On the other hand, the Internet explosion and the massive\ndiffusion of mobile smart devices lead to the creation of a worldwide system,\nwhich information is daily checked and fueled by the contribution of millions\nof users who interacts in a collaborative way. Search engines, continually\nexploring the Web, are a natural source of information on which to base a\nmodern approach to semantic annotation. A promising idea is that it is possible\nto generalize the semantic similarity, under the assumption that semantically\nsimilar terms behave similarly, and define collaborative proximity measures\nbased on the indexing information returned by search engines. The PMING\nDistance is a proximity measure used in data mining and information retrieval,\nwhich collaborative information express the degree of relationship between two\nterms, using only the number of documents returned as result for a query on a\nsearch engine. In this work, the PMINIG Distance is updated, providing a novel\nformal algebraic definition, which corrects previous works. The novel point of\nview underlines the features of the PMING to be a locally normalized linear\ncombination of the Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalized Google Distance.\nThe analyzed measure dynamically reflects the collaborative change made on the\nweb resources.", "published": "2017-01-09 13:02:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02163v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "math.PR", "68T20", "I.2.8; I.5.3; I.7.1"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
