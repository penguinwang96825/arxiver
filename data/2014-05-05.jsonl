{"title": "Learning Bilingual Word Representations by Marginalizing Alignments", "abstract": "We present a probabilistic model that simultaneously learns alignments and\ndistributed representations for bilingual data. By marginalizing over word\nalignments the model captures a larger semantic context than prior work relying\non hard alignments. The advantage of this approach is demonstrated in a\ncross-lingual classification task, where we outperform the prior published\nstate of the art.", "published": "2014-05-05 16:24:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0947v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Towards a Benchmark of Natural Language Arguments", "abstract": "The connections among natural language processing and argumentation theory\nare becoming stronger in the latest years, with a growing amount of works going\nin this direction, in different scenarios and applying heterogeneous\ntechniques. In this paper, we present two datasets we built to cope with the\ncombination of the Textual Entailment framework and bipolar abstract\nargumentation. In our approach, such datasets are used to automatically\nidentify through a Textual Entailment system the relations among the arguments\n(i.e., attack, support), and then the resulting bipolar argumentation graphs\nare analyzed to compute the accepted arguments.", "published": "2014-05-05 16:03:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0941v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Design and Optimization of a Speech Recognition Front-End for\n  Distant-Talking Control of a Music Playback Device", "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging scenario for the distant-talking control\nof a music playback device, a common portable speaker with four small\nloudspeakers in close proximity to one microphone. The user controls the device\nthrough voice, where the speech-to-music ratio can be as low as -30 dB during\nmusic playback. We propose a speech enhancement front-end that relies on known\nrobust methods for echo cancellation, double-talk detection, and noise\nsuppression, as well as a novel adaptive quasi-binary mask that is well suited\nfor speech recognition. The optimization of the system is then formulated as a\nlarge scale nonlinear programming problem where the recognition rate is\nmaximized and the optimal values for the system parameters are found through a\ngenetic algorithm. We validate our methodology by testing over the TIMIT\ndatabase for different music playback levels and noise types. Finally, we show\nthat the proposed front-end allows a natural interaction with the device for\nlimited-vocabulary voice commands.", "published": "2014-05-05 14:37:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1379v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
