{"title": "Semantic Variation in Online Communities of Practice", "abstract": "We introduce a framework for quantifying semantic variation of common words\nin Communities of Practice and in sets of topic-related communities. We show\nthat while some meaning shifts are shared across related communities, others\nare community-specific, and therefore independent from the discussed topic. We\npropose such findings as evidence in favour of sociolinguistic theories of\nsocially-driven semantic variation. Results are evaluated using an independent\nlanguage modelling task. Furthermore, we investigate extralinguistic features\nand show that factors such as prominence and dissemination of words are related\nto semantic variation.", "published": "2018-06-15 08:10:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05847v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An Empirical Analysis of the Correlation of Syntax and Prosody", "abstract": "The relation of syntax and prosody (the syntax--prosody interface) has been\nan active area of research, mostly in linguistics and typically studied under\ncontrolled conditions. More recently, prosody has also been successfully used\nin the data-based training of syntax parsers. However, there is a gap between\nthe controlled and detailed study of the individual effects between syntax and\nprosody and the large-scale application of prosody in syntactic parsing with\nonly a shallow analysis of the respective influences. In this paper, we close\nthe gap by investigating the significance of correlations of prosodic\nrealization with specific syntactic functions using linear mixed effects models\nin a very large corpus of read-out German encyclopedic texts. Using this\ncorpus, we are able to analyze prosodic structuring performed by a diverse set\nof speakers while they try to optimize factual content delivery. After\nnormalization by speaker, we obtain significant effects, e.g. confirming that\nthe subject function, as compared to the object function, has a positive effect\non pitch and duration of a word, but a negative effect on loudness.", "published": "2018-06-15 10:55:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05900v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "A Dataset for Building Code-Mixed Goal Oriented Conversation Systems", "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for goal-oriented conversation systems which\ncan assist users in various day-to-day activities such as booking tickets,\nrestaurant reservations, shopping, etc. Most of the existing datasets for\nbuilding such conversation systems focus on monolingual conversations and there\nis hardly any work on multilingual and/or code-mixed conversations. Such\ndatasets and systems thus do not cater to the multilingual regions of the\nworld, such as India, where it is very common for people to speak more than one\nlanguage and seamlessly switch between them resulting in code-mixed\nconversations. For example, a Hindi speaking user looking to book a restaurant\nwould typically ask, \"Kya tum is restaurant mein ek table book karne mein meri\nhelp karoge?\" (\"Can you help me in booking a table at this restaurant?\"). To\nfacilitate the development of such code-mixed conversation models, we build a\ngoal-oriented dialog dataset containing code-mixed conversations. Specifically,\nwe take the text from the DSTC2 restaurant reservation dataset and create\ncode-mixed versions of it in Hindi-English, Bengali-English, Gujarati-English\nand Tamil-English. We also establish initial baselines on this dataset using\nexisting state of the art models. This dataset along with our baseline\nimplementations is made publicly available for research purposes.", "published": "2018-06-15 14:28:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05997v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Although our model was trained on reports\ncreated using a LI-RADS template, it was also able to infer LI-RADS scoring for\nunstructured reports that were created before the LI-RADS guidelines were\nestablished. No human-labelled data was required in any step of this study; for\ntraining, LI-RADS scores were automatically extracted from those reports that\ncontained structured LI-RADS scores, and it translated the derived knowledge to\nreasoning on unstructured radiology reports. By providing automated LI-RADS\ncategorization, our approach may enable standardizing screening recommendations\nand treatment planning of patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and it\nmay facilitate AI-based healthcare research with US images by offering large\nscale text mining and data gathering opportunities from standard hospital\nclinical data repositories.", "published": "2018-06-15 20:11:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07346v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Stylized innovation: generating timelines by interrogating incrementally\n  available randomised dictionaries", "abstract": "A key challenge when trying to understand innovation is that it is a dynamic,\nongoing process, which can be highly contingent on ephemeral factors such as\nculture, economics, or luck. This means that any analysis of the real-world\nprocess must necessarily be historical - and thus probably too late to be most\nuseful - but also cannot be sure what the properties of the web of connections\nbetween innovations is or was. Here I try to address this by designing and\ngenerating a set of synthetic innovation web \"dictionaries\" that can be used to\nhost sampled innovation timelines, probe the overall statistics and behaviours\nof these processes, and determine the degree of their reliance on the structure\nor generating algorithm. Thus, inspired by the work of Fink, Reeves, Palma and\nFarr (2017) on innovation in language, gastronomy, and technology, I study how\nnew symbol discovery manifests itself in terms of additional \"word\" vocabulary\nbeing available from dictionaries generated from a finite number of symbols.\nSeveral distinct dictionary generation models are investigated using numerical\nsimulation, with emphasis on the scaling of knowledge as dictionary generators\nand parameters are varied, and the role of which order the symbols are\ndiscovered in.", "published": "2018-06-15 09:29:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07722v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Monaural source enhancement maximizing source-to-distortion ratio via\n  automatic differentiation", "abstract": "Recently, deep neural network (DNN) has made a breakthrough in monaural\nsource enhancement. Through a training step by using a large amount of data,\nDNN estimates a mapping between mixed signals and clean signals. At this time,\nwe use an objective function that numerically expresses the quality of a\nmapping by DNN. In the conventional methods, L1 norm, L2 norm, and\nItakura-Saito divergence are often used as objective functions. Recently, an\nobjective function based on short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) has\nalso been proposed. However, these functions only indicate similarity between\nthe clean signal and the estimated signal by DNN. In other words, they do not\nshow the quality of noise reduction or source enhancement. Motivated by the\nfact, this paper adopts signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) as the objective\nfunction. Since SDR virtually shows signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), maximizing SDR\nsolves the above problem. The experimental results revealed that the proposed\nmethod achieved better performance than the conventional methods.", "published": "2018-06-15 02:38:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05791v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.LG", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
