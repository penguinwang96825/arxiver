Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to\nanalyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens\nacross 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with\nhigher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain\nand uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at\nsimilar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent\nmodels may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the\nfeasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at\ninference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may\nbe used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.", "published": "2025-07-09 10:30:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06722v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

In the presence of covariates, a variety of\nregression-type models are often used for modeling insurance claims, ranging\nfrom relatively simple generalized linear models (GLMs) to regularized GLMs to\ngradient boosting models (GBMs). Conformal predictive inference has arisen as a\npopular distribution-free approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty under\nrelatively weak assumptions of exchangeability, and has been well studied under\nthe classic linear regression setting. In this work, we propose new\nnon-conformity measures for GLMs and GBMs with GLM-type loss. Using regularized\nTweedie GLM regression and LightGBM with Tweedie loss, we demonstrate conformal\nprediction performance with these non-conformity measures in insurance claims\ndata.

Since the TDOAs across different microphone\npairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of\nmicrophone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of\nmicrophone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently\na more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs\nby computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT\nfunction reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method.

Our\nframework consists of two key components: (1) a user intent-aware negative\nsampling module to filter invalid exposure samples, and (2) an intent-driven\ndual-debiasing module that jointly corrects exposure bias and click bias.\nExtensive online experiments on Taobao demonstrate the efficacy of our\nframework, achieving significant improvements in user click-through rates\n(UCTR) by 35.4% and 14.5% in two variants of the marketing block on the Taobao\nhomepage, Baiyibutie and Taobaomiaosha.", "published": "2025-07-09 03:02:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06503v2", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}

{"title": "Nexus: Taming Throughput-Latency Tradeoff in LLM Serving via Efficient GPU Sharing", "abstract": "Current prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation is typically deployed at the level\nof entire serving engines, assigning separate GPUs to handle prefill and decode\nphases. While effective at reducing latency, this approach demands more\nhardware. To improve GPU utilization, Chunked Prefill mixes prefill and decode\nrequests within the same batch, but introduces phase interference between\nprefill and decode.\n  While existing PD disaggregation solutions separate the phases across GPUs,\nwe ask: can the same decoupling be achieved within a single serving engine? The\nkey challenge lies in managing the conflicting resource requirements of prefill\nand decode when they share the same hardware. In this paper, we first show that\nchunked prefill requests cause interference with decode requests due to their\ndistinct requirements for GPU resources. Second, we find that GPU resources\nexhibit diminishing returns. Beyond a saturation point, increasing GPU\nallocation yields negligible latency improvements. This insight enables us to\nsplit a single GPU's resources and dynamically allocate them to prefill and\ndecode on the fly, effectively disaggregating the two phases within the same\nGPU.\n  Across a range of models and workloads, our system Nexus achieves up to 2.2x\nhigher throughput, 20x lower TTFT, and 2.5x lower TBT than vLLM. It also\noutperforms SGLang with up to 2x higher throughput, 2x lower TTFT, and 1.7x\nlower TBT, and achieves 1.4x higher throughput than vLLM-disaggregation using\nonly half the number of GPUs.", "published": "2025-07-09 07:27:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06608v2", "categories": ["cs.DC", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DC"}
{"title": "Prediction-Augmented Mechanism Design for Weighted Facility Location", "abstract": "Facility location is fundamental in operations research, mechanism design,\nand algorithmic game theory, with applications ranging from urban\ninfrastructure planning to distributed systems. Recent research in this area\nhas focused on augmenting classic strategyproof mechanisms with predictions to\nachieve an improved performance guarantee against the uncertainty under the\nstrategic environment. Previous work has been devoted to address the trade-off\nobstacle of balancing the consistency (near-optimality under accurate\npredictions) and robustness (bounded inefficiency under poor predictions)\nprimarily in the unweighted setting, assuming that all agents have the same\nimportance. However, this assumption may not be true in some practical\nscenarios, leading to research of weighted facility location problems.\n  The major contribution of the current work is to provide a prediction\naugmented algorithmic framework for balancing the consistency and robustness\nover strategic agents with non-uniform weights. In particular, through a\nreduction technique that identifies a subset of \\emph{representative} instances\nand maps the other given locations to the representative ones, we prove that\nthere exists a \\emph{strategyproof} mechanism achieving a bounded consistency\nguarantee of $\\frac{\\sqrt{(1+c)^2W^2_{\\min}+(1-c)^2W^2_{\\max}}}{(1+c)W_{\\min}}$\nand a bounded robustness guarantee of\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{(1-c)^2W^2_{\\min}+(1+c)^2W^2_{\\max}}}{(1-c)W_{\\min}}$ in weighted\nsettings, where $c$ can be viewed as a parameter to make a trade-off between\nthe consistency and robustness and $W_{\\min}$ and $W_{\\max}$ denote the minimum\nand maximum agents' weight. We also proved that there is no strategyproof\ndeterministic mechanism that reach $1$-consistency and $O\\left( n \\cdot\n\\frac{W_{\\max}}{W_{\\min}} \\right)$-robustness in weighted FLP, even with fully\npredictions of all agents.", "published": "2025-07-09 03:13:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06509v2", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.GT", "cs.LG", "68W27, 68Q32", "F.2.2"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
