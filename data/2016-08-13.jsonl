{"title": "An Analysis of Lemmatization on Topic Models of Morphologically Rich\n  Language", "abstract": "Topic models are typically represented by top-$m$ word lists for human\ninterpretation. The corpus is often pre-processed with lemmatization (or\nstemming) so that those representations are not undermined by a proliferation\nof words with similar meanings, but there is little public work on the effects\nof that pre-processing. Recent work studied the effect of stemming on topic\nmodels of English texts and found no supporting evidence for the practice. We\nstudy the effect of lemmatization on topic models of Russian Wikipedia\narticles, finding in one configuration that it significantly improves\ninterpretability according to a word intrusion metric. We conclude that\nlemmatization may benefit topic models on morphologically rich languages, but\nthat further investigation is needed.", "published": "2016-08-13 15:54:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03995v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Undecidability of the Lambek calculus with subexponential and bracket\n  modalities", "abstract": "The Lambek calculus is a well-known logical formalism for modelling natural\nlanguage syntax. The original calculus covered a substantial number of\nintricate natural language phenomena, but only those restricted to the\ncontext-free setting. In order to address more subtle linguistic issues, the\nLambek calculus has been extended in various ways. In particular, Morrill and\nValentin (2015) introduce an extension with so-called exponential and bracket\nmodalities. Their extension is based on a non-standard contraction rule for the\nexponential that interacts with the bracket structure in an intricate way. The\nstandard contraction rule is not admissible in this calculus. In this paper we\nprove undecidability of the derivability problem in their calculus. We also\ninvestigate restricted decidable fragments considered by Morrill and Valentin\nand we show that these fragments belong to the NP class.", "published": "2016-08-13 19:30:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04020v2", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.CL", "03B47"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
{"title": "Determining Health Utilities through Data Mining of Social Media", "abstract": "'Health utilities' measure patient preferences for perfect health compared to\nspecific unhealthy states, such as asthma, a fractured hip, or colon cancer.\nWhen integrated over time, these estimations are called quality adjusted life\nyears (QALYs). Until now, characterizing health utilities (HUs) required\ndetailed patient interviews or written surveys. While reliable and specific,\nthis data remained costly due to efforts to locate, enlist and coordinate\nparticipants. Thus the scope, context and temporality of diseases examined has\nremained limited.\n  Now that more than a billion people use social media, we propose a novel\nstrategy: use natural language processing to analyze public online\nconversations for signals of the severity of medical conditions and correlate\nthese to known HUs using machine learning. In this work, we filter a dataset\nthat originally contained 2 billion tweets for relevant content on 60 diseases.\nUsing this data, our algorithm successfully distinguished mild from severe\ndiseases, which had previously been categorized only by traditional techniques.\nThis represents progress towards two related applications: first, predicting\nHUs where such information is nonexistent; and second, (where rich HU data\nalready exists) estimating temporal or geographic patterns of disease severity\nthrough data mining.", "published": "2016-08-13 04:02:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03938v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CY", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
