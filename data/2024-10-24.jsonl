{"title": "Generation of synthetic financial time series by diffusion models", "abstract": "Despite its practical significance, generating realistic synthetic financial\ntime series is challenging due to statistical properties known as stylized\nfacts, such as fat tails, volatility clustering, and seasonality patterns.\nVarious generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), have been employed to address this challenge,\nalthough no model yet satisfies all the stylized facts. We alternatively\npropose utilizing diffusion models, specifically denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs), to generate synthetic financial time series. This\napproach employs wavelet transformation to convert multiple time series (into\nimages), such as stock prices, trading volumes, and spreads. Given these\nconverted images, the model gains the ability to generate images that can be\ntransformed back into realistic time series by inverse wavelet transformation.\nWe demonstrate that our proposed approach satisfies stylized facts.", "published": "2024-10-24 16:37:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18897v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "On the mean-field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: extreme value analysis", "abstract": "We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their\ndiffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each\nplayer is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of\nthe player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players.\nOur aim is to determine the $N \\to \\infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper\norder statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash\nstates). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions\nwhich is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the\nsystem of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance\nbetween the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing\nCentral Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in\nthe past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in\n$L^{\\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a\nGirsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to\nreduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard\nmean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous\nwork.", "published": "2024-10-24 15:54:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869v2", "categories": ["math.PR", "math.AP", "math.OC", "math.ST", "q-fin.MF", "stat.TH", "60H10, 35Q89, 60G70, 91A16"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
{"title": "What Drives Liquidity on Decentralized Exchanges? Evidence from the Uniswap Protocol", "abstract": "We study liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), identifying factors at\nthe platform, blockchain, token pair, and liquidity pool levels with predictive\npower for market depth metrics. We introduce the v2 counterfactual spread\nmetric, a novel criterion which assesses the degree of liquidity concentration\nin pools using the ``concentrated liquidity'' mechanism, allowing us to\ndecompose the effect of a factor on market depth into two channels: total value\nlocked (TVL) and concentration. We further explore how external liquidity from\ncompeting DEXs and private inventory on DEX aggregators influence market depth.\nWe find that (i) gas prices, returns, and a DEX's share of trading volume\naffect liquidity through concentration, (ii) internalization of order flow by\nprivate market makers affects TVL but not the overall market depth, and (iii)\nvolatility, fee revenue, and markout affect liquidity through both channels.", "published": "2024-10-24 19:15:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19107v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Double Auctions: Formalization and Automated Checkers", "abstract": "Double auctions are widely used in financial markets, such as those for\nstocks, derivatives, currencies, and commodities, to match demand and supply.\nOnce all buyers and sellers have placed their trade requests, the exchange\ndetermines how these requests are to be matched. The two most common objectives\nfor determining the matching are maximizing trade volume at a uniform price and\nmaximizing trade volume through dynamic pricing. Prior research has primarily\nfocused on single-quantity trade requests. In this work, we extend the\nframework to handle multiple-quantity trade requests and present fully\nformalized matching algorithms for double auctions, along with their\ncorrectness proofs. We establish new uniqueness theorems, enabling automatic\ndetection of violations in exchange systems by comparing their output to that\nof a verified program. All proofs are formalized in the Coq Proof Assistant,\nand we extract verified OCaml and Haskell programs that could serve as a\nresource for exchanges and market regulators. We demonstrate the practical\napplicability of our work by running the verified program on real market data\nfrom an exchange to automatically check for violations in the exchange\nalgorithm.", "published": "2024-10-24 14:00:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18751v1", "categories": ["cs.LO", "q-fin.TR", "F.3.1; K.4.4"], "primary_category": "cs.LO"}
