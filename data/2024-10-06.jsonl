{"title": "The Fourier Cosine Method for Discrete Probability Distributions", "abstract": "We provide a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating that the well-known\nsemi-analytical Fourier cosine (COS) formula for the inverse Fourier transform\nof continuous probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability\ndistributions, with the help of spectral filters. We establish general\nconvergence rates for these filters and further show that several classical\nspectral filters achieve convergence rates one order faster than previously\nrecognized in the literature on the Gibbs phenomenon. Our numerical experiments\ncorroborate the theoretical convergence results. Additionally, we illustrate\nthe computational speed and accuracy of the discrete COS method with\napplications in computational statistics and quantitative finance. The\ntheoretical and numerical results highlight the method's potential for solving\nproblems involving discrete distributions, particularly when the characteristic\nfunction is known, allowing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to be\nbypassed.", "published": "2024-10-06 14:05:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04487v2", "categories": ["math.NA", "cs.NA", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "math.NA"}
