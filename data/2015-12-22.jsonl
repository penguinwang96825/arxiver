{"title": "News Across Languages - Cross-Lingual Document Similarity and Event\n  Tracking", "abstract": "In today's world, we follow news which is distributed globally. Significant\nevents are reported by different sources and in different languages. In this\nwork, we address the problem of tracking of events in a large multilingual\nstream. Within a recently developed system Event Registry we examine two\naspects of this problem: how to compare articles in different languages and how\nto link collections of articles in different languages which refer to the same\nevent. Taking a multilingual stream and clusters of articles from each\nlanguage, we compare different cross-lingual document similarity measures based\non Wikipedia. This allows us to compute the similarity of any two articles\nregardless of language. Building on previous work, we show there are methods\nwhich scale well and can compute a meaningful similarity between articles from\nlanguages with little or no direct overlap in the training data. Using this\ncapability, we then propose an approach to link clusters of articles across\nlanguages which represent the same event. We provide an extensive evaluation of\nthe system as a whole, as well as an evaluation of the quality and robustness\nof the similarity measure and the linking algorithm.", "published": "2015-12-22 12:11:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07046v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Topical differences between Chinese language Twitter and Sina Weibo", "abstract": "Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, is currently used by\nover $500M$ users and is considered to be a proxy of Chinese social life. In\nthis study, we contrast the discussions occurring on Sina Weibo and on Chinese\nlanguage Twitter in order to observe two different strands of Chinese culture:\npeople within China who use Sina Weibo with its government imposed restrictions\nand those outside that are free to speak completely anonymously. We first\npropose a simple ad-hoc algorithm to identify topics of Tweets and Weibo.\nDifferent from previous works on micro-message topic detection, our algorithm\nconsiders topics of the same contents but with different \\#tags. Our algorithm\ncan also detect topics for Tweets and Weibos without any \\#tags. Using a large\ncorpus of Weibo and Chinese language tweets, covering the period from January\n$1$ to December $31$, $2012$, we obtain a list of topics using clustered \\#tags\nthat we can then use to compare the two platforms. Surprisingly, we find that\nthere are no common entries among the Top $100$ most popular topics.\nFurthermore, only $9.2\\%$ of tweets correspond to the Top $1000$ topics on Sina\nWeibo platform, and conversely only $4.4\\%$ of weibos were found to discuss the\nmost popular Twitter topics. Our results reveal significant differences in\nsocial attention on the two platforms, with most popular topics on Sina Weibo\nrelating to entertainment while most tweets corresponded to cultural or\npolitical contents that is practically non existent in Sina Weibo.", "published": "2015-12-22 22:13:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07281v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
