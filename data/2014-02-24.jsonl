{"title": "Tripartite Graph Clustering for Dynamic Sentiment Analysis on Social\n  Media", "abstract": "The growing popularity of social media (e.g, Twitter) allows users to easily\nshare information with each other and influence others by expressing their own\nsentiments on various subjects. In this work, we propose an unsupervised\n\\emph{tri-clustering} framework, which analyzes both user-level and tweet-level\nsentiments through co-clustering of a tripartite graph. A compelling feature of\nthe proposed framework is that the quality of sentiment clustering of tweets,\nusers, and features can be mutually improved by joint clustering. We further\ninvestigate the evolution of user-level sentiments and latent feature vectors\nin an online framework and devise an efficient online algorithm to sequentially\nupdate the clustering of tweets, users and features with newly arrived data.\nThe online framework not only provides better quality of both dynamic\nuser-level and tweet-level sentiment analysis, but also improves the\ncomputational and storage efficiency. We verified the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed approaches on the November 2012 California ballot\nTwitter data.", "published": "2014-02-24 22:58:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6010v3", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
