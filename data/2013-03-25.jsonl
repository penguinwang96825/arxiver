{"title": "Compression as a universal principle of animal behavior", "abstract": "A key aim in biology and psychology is to identify fundamental principles\nunderpinning the behavior of animals, including humans. Analyses of human\nlanguage and the behavior of a range of non-human animal species have provided\nevidence for a common pattern underlying diverse behavioral phenomena: words\nfollow Zipf's law of brevity (the tendency of more frequently used words to be\nshorter), and conformity to this general pattern has been seen in the behavior\nof a number of other animals. It has been argued that the presence of this law\nis a sign of efficient coding in the information theoretic sense. However, no\nstrong direct connection has been demonstrated between the law and compression,\nthe information theoretic principle of minimizing the expected length of a\ncode. Here we show that minimizing the expected code length implies that the\nlength of a word cannot increase as its frequency increases. Furthermore, we\nshow that the mean code length or duration is significantly small in human\nlanguage, and also in the behavior of other species in all cases where\nagreement with the law of brevity has been found. We argue that compression is\na general principle of animal behavior, that reflects selection for efficiency\nof coding.", "published": "2013-03-25 15:43:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6175v1", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "physics.data-an", "q-bio.QM"], "primary_category": "q-bio.NC"}
