{"title": "A complex network approach to stylometry", "abstract": "Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental\nproperties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical\nsystems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large\namount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a\nlimited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying\nphysical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language\nprocessing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex\nnetworks methods that are able to improve the performance of current\nstatistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the\ntopological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual\ndescription. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches\noutperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods\nwere used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here\ncould be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the\ntopology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.", "published": "2015-06-30 14:32:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09107v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Language Understanding for Text-based Games Using Deep Reinforcement\n  Learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the task of learning control policies for\ntext-based games. In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are\nthrough text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language\nbarrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We\nemploy a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state\nrepresentations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This\nframework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that\ncapture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game\nworlds, comparing against baselines using bag-of-words and bag-of-bigrams for\nstate representations. Our algorithm outperforms the baselines on both worlds\ndemonstrating the importance of learning expressive representations.", "published": "2015-06-30 05:51:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08941v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus: A Large Dataset for Research in Unstructured\n  Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems", "abstract": "This paper introduces the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, a dataset containing almost\n1 million multi-turn dialogues, with a total of over 7 million utterances and\n100 million words. This provides a unique resource for research into building\ndialogue managers based on neural language models that can make use of large\namounts of unlabeled data. The dataset has both the multi-turn property of\nconversations in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge datasets, and the\nunstructured nature of interactions from microblog services such as Twitter. We\nalso describe two neural learning architectures suitable for analyzing this\ndataset, and provide benchmark performance on the task of selecting the best\nnext response.", "published": "2015-06-30 00:37:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08909v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
