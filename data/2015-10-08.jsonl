{"title": "Automata networks for multi-party communication in the Naming Game", "abstract": "The Naming Game has been studied to explore the role of self-organization in\nthe development and negotiation of linguistic conventions. In this paper, we\ndefine an automata networks approach to the Naming Game. Two problems are\nfaced: (1) the definition of an automata networks for multi-party communicative\ninteractions; and (2) the proof of convergence for three different orders in\nwhich the individuals are updated (updating schemes). Finally, computer\nsimulations are explored in two-dimensional lattices with the purpose to\nrecover the main features of the Naming Game and to describe the dynamics under\ndifferent updating schemes.", "published": "2015-10-08 15:15:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02358v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Mapping Unseen Words to Task-Trained Embedding Spaces", "abstract": "We consider the supervised training setting in which we learn task-specific\nword embeddings. We assume that we start with initial embeddings learned from\nunlabelled data and update them to learn task-specific embeddings for words in\nthe supervised training data. However, for new words in the test set, we must\nuse either their initial embeddings or a single unknown embedding, which often\nleads to errors. We address this by learning a neural network to map from\ninitial embeddings to the task-specific embedding space, via a multi-loss\nobjective function. The technique is general, but here we demonstrate its use\nfor improved dependency parsing (especially for sentences with\nout-of-vocabulary words), as well as for downstream improvements on sentiment\nanalysis.", "published": "2015-10-08 16:17:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02387v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
