{"title": "Crime Topic Modeling", "abstract": "The classification of crime into discrete categories entails a massive loss\nof information. Crimes emerge out of a complex mix of behaviors and situations,\nyet most of these details cannot be captured by singular crime type labels.\nThis information loss impacts our ability to not only understand the causes of\ncrime, but also how to develop optimal crime prevention strategies. We apply\nmachine learning methods to short narrative text descriptions accompanying\ncrime records with the goal of discovering ecologically more meaningful latent\ncrime classes. We term these latent classes \"crime topics\" in reference to\ntext-based topic modeling methods that produce them. We use topic distributions\nto measure clustering among formally recognized crime types. Crime topics\nreplicate broad distinctions between violent and property crime, but also\nreveal nuances linked to target characteristics, situational conditions and the\ntools and methods of attack. Formal crime types are not discrete in topic\nspace. Rather, crime types are distributed across a range of crime topics.\nSimilarly, individual crime topics are distributed across a range of formal\ncrime types. Key ecological groups include identity theft, shoplifting,\nburglary and theft, car crimes and vandalism, criminal threats and confidence\ncrimes, and violent crimes. Though not a replacement for formal legal crime\nclassifications, crime topics provide a unique window into the heterogeneous\ncausal processes underlying crime.", "published": "2017-01-05 23:35:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01505v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
