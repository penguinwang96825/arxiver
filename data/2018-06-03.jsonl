{"title": "Convergence to the Mean Field Game Limit: A Case Study", "abstract": "We study the convergence of Nash equilibria in a game of optimal stopping. If the associated mean field game has a unique equilibrium, any sequence of $n$-player equilibria converges to it as $n\\to\\infty$. However, both the finite and infinite player versions of the game often admit multiple equilibria. We show that mean field equilibria satisfying a transversality condition are limit points of $n$-player equilibria, but we also exhibit a remarkable class of mean field equilibria that are not limits, thus questioning their interpretation as \"large $n$\" equilibria.", "published": "2018-06-03 15:30:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00817v2", "categories": ["math.OC", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
