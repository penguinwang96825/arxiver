{"title": "Using Arabic Wordnet for semantic indexation in information retrieval\n  system", "abstract": "In the context of arabic Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) guided by arabic\nontology and to enable those systems to better respond to user requirements,\nthis paper aims to representing documents and queries by the best concepts\nextracted from Arabic Wordnet. Identified concepts belonging to Arabic WordNet\nsynsets are extracted from documents and queries, and those having a single\nsense are expanded. The expanded query is then used by the IRS to retrieve the\nrelevant documents searched. Our experiments are based primarily on a medium\nsize corpus of arabic text. The results obtained shown us that there are a\nglobal improvement in the performance of the arabic IRS.", "published": "2013-06-11 12:24:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2499v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A Perceptual Alphabet for the 10-dimensional Phonetic-prosodic Space", "abstract": "We define an alphabet, the IHA, of the 10-D phonetic-prosodic space. The\ndimensions of this space are perceptual observables, rather than articulatory\nspecifications. Speech is defined as a random chain in time of the 4-D phonetic\nsubspace, that is, a symbolic sequence, augmented with diacritics of the\nremaining 6-D prosodic subspace. The definitions here are based on the model of\nspeech of oral billiards, and supersedes an earlier version. This paper only\nenumerates the IHA in detail as a supplement to the exposition of oral\nbilliards in a separate paper. The IHA has been implemented as the target\nrandom variable in a speech recognizer.", "published": "2013-06-11 17:48:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2593v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
