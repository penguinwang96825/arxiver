While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks\nto uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised\ncounterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent\nspace. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning\nprovide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations.

We employ crime incident data obtained from each\ncity's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American\nCommunity Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to\n2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.\nmiles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a\nConvolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime\noccurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences.

{"title": "Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust Models", "abstract": "While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on\nspecific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into\ninterpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and\nbuild practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more\nrobust against Gaussian noise.", "published": "2025-09-25 09:24:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20939v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

{"title": "Fundamental Limits of Noncoherent Massive Random Access Networks", "abstract": "This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks,\nmodeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells.\nTo characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument\nis invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their\ncodebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in\nthe literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the\ntransmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading\ncoefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed\nthat the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,\nrigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds\ndepends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering\ncells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the\ninterferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay\nexponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit\npower. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited\nnetworks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews (\"Fundamental limits of\ncooperation\", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by\nrandom user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In\ncontrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,\nthen the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded\ncapacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since\nthe condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents\ninterference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple\naccess.

To circumvent the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound,\nwe consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size\n$D$, and show tight bounds of $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain\nan optimal $O(d + \\log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned\nhalfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \\log n)$ vs. $\\Omega(d + \\log n)$.\nIn fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean\nfunction $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$\nprovided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these\norderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each\nordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.\n  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal\nalgorithms for PAC-learning.

Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,\nmost existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In\nthis study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial\nstates through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose\nthe concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's\ncompetitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly\nshaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error\nbound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a\nfine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training\ncontroller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a\nprincipled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals\nand thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a\ncomputationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information\ndecomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into\nfine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and\nsynergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically\nbalances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial\nstate to start joint training by tracking peak synergy.

{"title": "TF-Restormer: Complex Spectral Prediction for Speech Restoration", "abstract": "Speech restoration in real-world conditions is challenging due to compounded\ndistortions such as clipping, band-pass filtering, digital artifacts, noise,\nand reverberation, and low sampling rates. Existing systems, including\nvocoder-based approaches, often sacrifice signal fidelity, while diffusion\nmodels remain impractical for streaming. Moreover, most assume a fixed target\nsampling rate, requiring external resampling that leads to redundant\ncomputations. We present TF-Restormer, an encoder-decoder architecture that\nconcentrates analysis on input-bandwidth with a time-frequency dual-path\nencoder and reconstructs missing high-frequency bands through a light decoder\nwith frequency extension queries. It enables efficient and universal\nrestoration across arbitrary input-output rates without redundant resampling.\nTo support adversarial training across diverse rates, we introduce a shared\nsampling-frequency-independent (SFI) STFT discriminator. TF-Restormer further\nsupports streaming with a causal time module, and improves robustness under\nextreme degradations by injecting spectral inductive bias into the frequency\nmodule. Finally, we propose a scaled log-spectral loss that stabilizes\noptimization under severe conditions while emphasizing well-predicted spectral\ndetails. As a single model across sampling rates, TF-Restormer consistently\noutperforms prior systems, achieving balanced gains in signal fidelity and\nperceptual quality, while its streaming mode maintains competitive\neffectiveness for real-time application.
