{"title": "HPS: a hierarchical Persian stemming method", "abstract": "In this paper, a novel hierarchical Persian stemming approach based on the\nPart-Of-Speech of the word in a sentence is presented. The implemented stemmer\nincludes hash tables and several deterministic finite automata in its different\nlevels of hierarchy for removing the prefixes and suffixes of the words. We had\ntwo intentions in using hash tables in our method. The first one is that the\nDFA don't support some special words, so hash table can partly solve the\naddressed problem. the second goal is to speed up the implemented stemmer with\nomitting the time that deterministic finite automata need. Because of the\nhierarchical organization, this method is fast and flexible enough. Our\nexperiments on test sets from Hamshahri collection and security news (istna.ir)\nshow that our method has the average accuracy of 95.37% which is even improved\nin using the method on a test set with common topics.", "published": "2014-03-12 08:08:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2837v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
