{"title": "Multivariate Rough Volatility", "abstract": "Motivated by empirical evidence from the joint behavior of realized\nvolatility time series, we propose to model the joint dynamics of\nlog-volatilities using a multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\nThis model is a multivariate version of the Rough Fractional Stochastic\nVolatility model proposed in Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum, Quant. Finance,\n2018. It allows for different Hurst exponents in the different marginal\ncomponents and non trivial interdependencies.\n  We discuss the main features of the model and propose an estimator that\njointly identifies its parameters. We derive the asymptotic theory of the\nestimator and perform a simulation study that confirms the asymptotic theory in\nfinite sample.\n  We carry out an extensive empirical investigation on all realized volatility\ntime series covering the entire span of about two decades in the Oxford-Man\nrealized library. Our analysis shows that these time series are strongly\ncorrelated and can exhibit asymmetries in their cross-covariance structure,\naccurately captured by our model. These asymmetries lead to spillover effects\nthat we analyse theoretically within the model and then using our empirical\nestimates. Moreover, in accordance with the existing literature, we observe\nbehaviors close to non-stationarity and rough trajectories.", "published": "2024-12-18 21:40:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14353v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "60G15, 62M09, 60G22"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Refining and Robust Backtesting of A Century of Profitable Industry Trends", "abstract": "We revisit the long-only trend-following strategy presented in A Century of\nProfitable Industry Trends by Zarattini and Antonacci, which achieved\nexceptional historical performance with an 18.2% annualized return and a Sharpe\nRatio of 1.39. While the results outperformed benchmarks, practical\nimplementation raises concerns about robustness and evolving market conditions.\nThis study explores modifications addressing reliance on T-bills, alternative\nfallback allocations, and industry exclusions. Despite attempts to enhance\nadaptability through momentum signals, parameter optimization, and Walk-Forward\nAnalysis, results reveal persistent challenges. The results highlight\nchallenges in adapting historical strategies to modern markets and offer\ninsights for future trend-following frameworks.", "published": "2024-12-18 21:57:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14361v2", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
