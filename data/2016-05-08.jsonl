{"title": "A corpus of preposition supersenses in English web reviews", "abstract": "We present the first corpus annotated with preposition supersenses,\nunlexicalized categories for semantic functions that can be marked by English\nprepositions (Schneider et al., 2015). That scheme improves upon its\npredecessors to better facilitate comprehensive manual annotation. Moreover,\nunlike the previous schemes, the preposition supersenses are organized\nhierarchically. Our data will be publicly released on the web upon publication.", "published": "2016-05-08 01:38:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02257v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Problems With Evaluation of Word Embeddings Using Word Similarity Tasks", "abstract": "Lacking standardized extrinsic evaluation methods for vector representations\nof words, the NLP community has relied heavily on word similarity tasks as a\nproxy for intrinsic evaluation of word vectors. Word similarity evaluation,\nwhich correlates the distance between vectors and human judgments of semantic\nsimilarity is attractive, because it is computationally inexpensive and fast.\nIn this paper we present several problems associated with the evaluation of\nword vectors on word similarity datasets, and summarize existing solutions. Our\nstudy suggests that the use of word similarity tasks for evaluation of word\nvectors is not sustainable and calls for further research on evaluation\nmethods.", "published": "2016-05-08 05:09:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02276v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
