{"title": "Solving Multi-Period Financial Planning Models: Combining Monte Carlo Tree Search and Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces the MCTS algorithm to the financial world and focuses on solving significant multi-period financial planning models by combining a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm with a deep neural network. The MCTS provides an advanced start for the neural network so that the combined method outperforms either approach alone, yielding competitive results. Several innovations improve the computations, including a variant of the upper confidence bound applied to trees (UTC) and a special lookup search. We compare the two-step algorithm with employing dynamic programs/neural networks. Both approaches solve regime switching models with 50-time steps and transaction costs with twelve asset categories. Heretofore, these problems have been outside the range of solvable optimization models via traditional algorithms.", "published": "2022-02-15 21:28:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07734v3", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "An SMP-Based Algorithm for Solving the Constrained Utility Maximization Problem via Deep Learning", "abstract": "We consider the utility maximization problem under convex constraints with regard to theoretical results which allow the formulation of algorithmic solvers which make use of deep learning techniques. In particular for the case of random coefficients, we prove a stochastic maximum principle (SMP), which also holds for utility functions $U$ with $\\mathrm{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^{+}} \\cdot U'$ being not necessarily nonincreasing, like the power utility functions, thereby generalizing the SMP proved by Li and Zheng (2018). We use this SMP together with the strong duality property for defining a new algorithm, which we call deep primal SMP algorithm. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm - in particular for higher-dimensional problems and problems with random coefficients, which are either path dependent or satisfy their own SDEs. Moreover, our numerical experiments for constrained problems show that the novel deep primal SMP algorithm overcomes the deep SMP algorithm's (see Davey and Zheng (2021)) weakness of erroneously producing the value of the corresponding unconstrained problem. Furthermore, in contrast to the deep controlled 2BSDE algorithm from Davey and Zheng (2021), this algorithm is also applicable to problems with path dependent coefficients. As the deep primal SMP algorithm even yields the most accurate results in many of our studied problems, we can highly recommend its usage. Moreover, we propose a learning procedure based on epochs which improved the results of our algorithm even further. Implementing a semi-recurrent network architecture for the control process turned out to be also a valuable advancement.", "published": "2022-02-15 22:50:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07771v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.OC", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
