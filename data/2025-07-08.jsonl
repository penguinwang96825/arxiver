Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that\nrequire pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.\nHowever, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in\nlocalization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach\nemploys a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and\nthen extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as\nwell as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is\nperformed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using\nradial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied\nto the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve\nvertical discrepancies.

To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the\ncontext of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods.

{"title": "Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain", "abstract": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the\ntheory by examining the different types of long-range connections between\ncortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these\nconnections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a\nheterarchy of sensorimotor regions.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%\naccuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively.

It is known that $\\Theta(d/\\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\\rho$ are\nnecessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled\nmeasurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for\na worst-case $\\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is\nfor this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal\nbounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the\ntester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],\nthey remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements\nthey can perform.\n  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for\nquantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled\nmeasurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal\ncopy complexity for certifying $\\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity\ntimes the fidelity between $\\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state.

ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al.

{"title": "Too Human to Model:The Uncanny Valley of LLMs in Social Simulation -- When Generative Language Agents Misalign with Modelling Principles", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in\nsocial simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent,\ncontextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of\nmodels. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the\nepistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,\nare too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be\nconsistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically\ndemanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the\necosystem of social simulation for future applications.", "published": "2025-07-08 18:02:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06310v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}

The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection\nperformance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the\naxial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional\ndomain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We\npropose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.\nMethods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI\n(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)\nand apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was\ninvestigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data\nfrom an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively\nsmaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:\nCCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063\nrespectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060).

As sleep studies are\nbecoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly\nsusceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper\naddresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package\nto utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect\nsegments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained\nand evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15\nparticipants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid\noverall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens\nkappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in\nidentifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.\nAdditionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection\nusing another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and\ngenerating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental\nchallenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and\nrigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their\noutcomes.", "published": "2025-07-08 22:27:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06433v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP", "q-bio.QM"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,\nResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection.

Six tampering strategies, including structured segment\nsubstitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.\nThe one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional\nrepresentation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet\ntransform (CWT).

Experimental\nresults show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,\nFeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding\n99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent\nfrom A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B\nsubstitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable\nperformance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent .

These models aim at learning the\nscore function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to\nthe target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a\nvariety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score\nmatching, Hyv\\\"arien's method, or Schr\\\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we\nderive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad\nclass of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern\nstochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint\noperators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type\nformula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written\nentirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all\nMalliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its\npractical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work\noffers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in\ngenerative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for\ncomplex probability distributions.
