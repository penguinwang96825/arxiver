{"title": "Learning in the Rational Speech Acts Model", "abstract": "The Rational Speech Acts (RSA) model treats language use as a recursive\nprocess in which probabilistic speaker and listener agents reason about each\nother's intentions to enrich the literal semantics of their language along\nbroadly Gricean lines. RSA has been shown to capture many kinds of\nconversational implicature, but it has been criticized as an unrealistic model\nof speakers, and it has so far required the manual specification of a semantic\nlexicon, preventing its use in natural language processing applications that\nlearn lexical knowledge from data. We address these concerns by showing how to\ndefine and optimize a trained statistical classifier that uses the intermediate\nagents of RSA as hidden layers of representation forming a non-linear\nactivation function. This treatment opens up new application domains and new\npossibilities for learning effectively from data. We validate the model on a\nreferential expression generation task, showing that the best performance is\nachieved by incorporating features approximating well-established insights\nabout natural language generation into RSA.", "published": "2015-10-23 02:24:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06807v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Fast Latent Variable Models for Inference and Visualization on Mobile\n  Devices", "abstract": "In this project we outline Vedalia, a high performance distributed network\nfor performing inference on latent variable models in the context of Amazon\nreview visualization. We introduce a new model, RLDA, which extends Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) [Blei et al., 2003] for the review space by\nincorporating auxiliary data available in online reviews to improve modeling\nwhile simultaneously remaining compatible with pre-existing fast sampling\ntechniques such as [Yao et al., 2009; Li et al., 2014a] to achieve high\nperformance. The network is designed such that computation is efficiently\noffloaded to the client devices using the Chital system [Robinson & Li, 2015],\nimproving response times and reducing server costs. The resulting system is\nable to rapidly compute a large number of specialized latent variable models\nwhile requiring minimal server resources.", "published": "2015-10-23 05:26:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07035v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.DC", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
