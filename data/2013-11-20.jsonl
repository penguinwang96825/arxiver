{"title": "Complexity measurement of natural and artificial languages", "abstract": "We compared entropy for texts written in natural languages (English, Spanish)\nand artificial languages (computer software) based on a simple expression for\nthe entropy as a function of message length and specific word diversity. Code\ntext written in artificial languages showed higher entropy than text of similar\nlength expressed in natural languages. Spanish texts exhibit more symbolic\ndiversity than English ones. Results showed that algorithms based on complexity\nmeasures differentiate artificial from natural languages, and that text\nanalysis based on complexity measures allows the unveiling of important aspects\nof their nature. We propose specific expressions to examine entropy related\naspects of tests and estimate the values of entropy, emergence,\nself-organization and complexity based on specific diversity and message\nlength.", "published": "2013-11-20 02:43:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5427v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "nlin.AO", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
