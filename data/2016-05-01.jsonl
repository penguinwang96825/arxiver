{"title": "Text-mining the NeuroSynth corpus using Deep Boltzmann Machines", "abstract": "Large-scale automated meta-analysis of neuroimaging data has recently\nestablished itself as an important tool in advancing our understanding of human\nbrain function. This research has been pioneered by NeuroSynth, a database\ncollecting both brain activation coordinates and associated text across a large\ncohort of neuroimaging research papers. One of the fundamental aspects of such\nmeta-analysis is text-mining. To date, word counts and more sophisticated\nmethods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation have been proposed. In this work we\npresent an unsupervised study of the NeuroSynth text corpus using Deep\nBoltzmann Machines (DBMs). The use of DBMs yields several advantages over the\naforementioned methods, principal among which is the fact that it yields both\nword and document embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space. Such\nembeddings serve to facilitate the use of traditional machine learning\ntechniques on the text corpus. The proposed DBM model is shown to learn\nembeddings with a clear semantic structure.", "published": "2016-05-01 09:01:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00223v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "q-bio.NC", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
