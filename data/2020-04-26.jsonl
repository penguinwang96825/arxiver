{"title": "Research on Modeling Units of Transformer Transducer for Mandarin Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Modeling unit and model architecture are two key factors of Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T) in end-to-end speech recognition. To improve the performance of RNN-T for Mandarin speech recognition task, a novel transformer transducer with the combination architecture of self-attention transformer and RNN is proposed. And then the choice of different modeling units for transformer transducer is explored. In addition, we present a new mix-bandwidth training method to obtain a general model that is able to accurately recognize Mandarin speech with different sampling rates simultaneously. All of our experiments are conducted on about 12,000 hours of Mandarin speech with sampling rate in 8kHz and 16kHz. Experimental results show that Mandarin transformer transducer using syllable with tone achieves the best performance. It yields an average of 14.4% and 44.1% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction when compared with the models using syllable initial/final with tone and Chinese character, respectively. Also, it outperforms the model based on syllable initial/final with tone with an average of 13.5% relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction.", "published": "2020-04-26 05:12:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13522v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Methods for Computing Legal Document Similarity: A Comparative Study", "abstract": "Computing similarity between two legal documents is an important and challenging task in the domain of Legal Information Retrieval. Finding similar legal documents has many applications in downstream tasks, including prior-case retrieval, recommendation of legal articles, and so on. Prior works have proposed two broad ways of measuring similarity between legal documents - analyzing the precedent citation network, and measuring similarity based on textual content similarity measures. But there has not been a comprehensive comparison of these existing methods on a common platform. In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the existing methods. In addition, we explore two promising new similarity computation methods - one text-based and the other based on network embeddings, which have not been considered till now.", "published": "2020-04-26 08:26:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12307v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}

The basic idea is to raise the slope of the ReLU function at the test time. Experiments over MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense against a number of strong attacks in both untargeted and targeted settings. While perhaps not as effective as the state of the art adversarial defenses, this approach can provide insights to understand and mitigate adversarial attacks. It can also be used in conjunction with other defenses.", "published": "2020-04-26 03:09:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13013v3", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}
{"title": "Development of a High Fidelity Simulator for Generalised Photometric Based Space Object Classification using Machine Learning", "abstract": "This paper presents the initial stages in the development of a deep learning classifier for generalised Resident Space Object (RSO) characterisation that combines high-fidelity simulated light curves with transfer learning to improve the performance of object characterisation models that are trained on real data. The classification and characterisation of RSOs is a significant goal in Space Situational Awareness (SSA) in order to improve the accuracy of orbital predictions. The specific focus of this paper is the development of a high-fidelity simulation environment for generating realistic light curves. The simulator takes in a textured geometric model of an RSO as well as the objects ephemeris and uses Blender to generate photo-realistic images of the RSO that are then processed to extract the light curve. Simulated light curves have been compared with real light curves extracted from telescope imagery to provide validation for the simulation environment. Future work will involve further validation and the use of the simulator to generate a dataset of realistic light curves for the purpose of training neural networks.", "published": "2020-04-26 02:10:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12270v1", "categories": ["physics.space-ph", "astro-ph.IM", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "physics.space-ph"}
{"title": "An Extension of LIME with Improvement of Interpretability and Fidelity", "abstract": "While deep learning makes significant achievements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the lack of transparency has limited its broad application in various vertical domains. Explainability is not only a gateway between AI and real world, but also a powerful feature to detect flaw of the models and bias of the data. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely-accepted technique that explains the prediction of any classifier faithfully by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. As an extension of LIME, this paper proposes an high-interpretability and high-fidelity local explanation method, known as Local Explanation using feature Dependency Sampling and Nonlinear Approximation (LEDSNA). Given an instance being explained, LEDSNA enhances interpretability by feature sampling with intrinsic dependency. Besides, LEDSNA improves the local explanation fidelity by approximating nonlinear boundary of local decision. We evaluate our method with classification tasks in both image domain and text domain. Experiments show that LEDSNA's explanation of the back-box model achieves much better performance than original LIME in terms of interpretability and fidelity.", "published": "2020-04-26 02:54:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12277v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "DeepSeg: Deep Neural Network Framework for Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation using Magnetic Resonance FLAIR Images", "abstract": "Purpose: Gliomas are the most common and aggressive type of brain tumors due to their infiltrative nature and rapid progression. The process of distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task in the clinical routine. Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration. Therefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture; namely DeepSeg for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion using FLAIR MRI data.\n  Methods: The developed DeepSeg is a modular decoupling framework. It consists of two connected core parts based on an encoding and decoding relationship. The encoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for spatial information extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder part to get the full resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net architecture, different CNN models such as Residual Neural Network (ResNet), Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and NASNet have been utilized in this study.\n  Results: The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully tested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2019) challenge, including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for validation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance scores of obtained segmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly.\n  Conclusion: This study showed successful feasibility and comparative performance of applying different deep learning models in a new DeepSeg framework for automated brain tumor segmentation in FLAIR MR images. The proposed DeepSeg is open-source and freely available at https://github.com/razeineldin/DeepSeg/.", "published": "2020-04-26 09:50:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12333v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}

However, concerns have been raised on adverse health impacts that human users can experience in a 5G system by being exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMFs). This article investigates the human EMF exposure in a 5G system and compare to those measured in the previous-generation cellular systems. It suggests a minimum separation distance between a transmitter and a human user for keeping the EMF exposure below the safety regulation level, which provides consumers with a general understanding on the safe use of 5G communications.", "published": "2020-04-26 20:35:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12474v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Ensemble long short-term memory (EnLSTM) network", "abstract": "In this study, we propose an ensemble long short-term memory (EnLSTM) network, which can be trained on a small dataset and process sequential data. The EnLSTM is built by combining the ensemble neural network (ENN) and the cascaded long short-term memory (C-LSTM) network to leverage their complementary strengths. In order to resolve the issues of over-convergence and disturbance compensation associated with training failure owing to the nature of small-data problems, model parameter perturbation and high-fidelity observation perturbation methods are introduced. The EnLSTM is compared with commonly-used models on a published dataset, and proven to be the state-of-the-art model in generating well logs with a mean-square-error (MSE) reduction of 34%. In the case study, 12 well logs that cannot be measured while drilling are generated based on logging-while-drilling (LWD) data. The EnLSTM is capable to reduce cost and save time in practice.", "published": "2020-04-26 05:42:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13562v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
