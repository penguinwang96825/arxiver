{"title": "DeFi Arbitrage in Hedged Liquidity Tokens", "abstract": "Empirically, the prevailing market prices for liquidity tokens of the\nconstant product market maker (CPMM) -- as offered in practice by companies\nsuch as Uniswap -- readily permit arbitrage opportunities by delta hedging the\nrisk of the position. Herein, we investigate this arbitrage opportunity by\ntreating the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the\nunderlying assets for the CPMM. In doing so, not dissimilar to the\nBlack-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for\nthese liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we\nconstruct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated\n(non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We\nconclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing\nof liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.", "published": "2024-09-17 16:41:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Unlocking NACE Classification Embeddings with OpenAI for Enhanced Analysis and Processing", "abstract": "The Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European\nCommunity (NACE) is the standard classification system for the categorization\nof economic and industrial activities within the European Union. This paper\nproposes a novel approach to transform the NACE classification into\nlow-dimensional embeddings, using state-of-the-art models and dimensionality\nreduction techniques. The primary challenge is the preservation of the\nhierarchical structure inherent within the original NACE classification while\nreducing the number of dimensions. To address this issue, we introduce custom\nmetrics designed to quantify the retention of hierarchical relationships\nthroughout the embedding and reduction processes. The evaluation of these\nmetrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in retaining\nthe structural information essential for insightful analysis. This approach not\nonly facilitates the visual exploration of economic activity relationships, but\nalso increases the efficacy of downstream tasks, including clustering,\nclassification, integration with other classifications, and others. Through\nexperimental validation, the utility of our proposed framework in preserving\nhierarchical structures within the NACE classification is showcased, thereby\nproviding a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers to understand and\nleverage any hierarchical data.", "published": "2024-09-17 19:49:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11524v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.ST", "62M45, 91G40", "G.3; I.2"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Value of Information in the Mean-Square Case and its Application to the Analysis of Financial Time-Series Forecast", "abstract": "The advances and development of various machine learning techniques has lead\nto practical solutions in various areas of science, engineering, medicine and\nfinance. The great choice of algorithms, their implementations and libraries\nhas resulted in another challenge of selecting the right algorithm and tuning\ntheir parameters in order to achieve optimal or satisfactory performance in\nspecific applications. Here we show how the value of information (V(I)) can be\nused in this task to guide the algorithm choice and parameter tuning process.\nAfter estimating the amount of Shannon's mutual information between the\npredictor and response variables, V(I) can define theoretical upper bound of\nperformance of any algorithm. The inverse function I(V) defines the lower\nfrontier of the minimum amount of information required to achieve the desired\nperformance. In this paper, we illustrate the value of information for the\nmean-square error minimization and apply it to forecasts of cryptocurrency\nlog-returns.", "published": "2024-09-17 17:53:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01831v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "94A15, 94A17, 94A34, 62J12, 62M45, 60G25"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
