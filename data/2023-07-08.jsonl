{"title": "Compression Performance Analysis of Different File Formats", "abstract": "In data storage and transmission, file compression is a common technique for reducing the volume of data, reducing data storage space and transmission time and bandwidth. However, there are significant differences in the compression performance of different types of file formats, and the benefits vary. In this paper, 22 file formats with approximately 178GB of data were collected and the Zlib algorithm was used for compression experiments to compare performance in order to investigate the compression gains of different file types. The experimental results show that some file types are poorly compressed, with almost constant file size and long compression time, resulting in lower gains; some other file types are significantly reduced in file size and compression time after compression, which can effectively reduce the data volume. Based on the above experimental results, this paper will then selectively reduce the data volume by compression in data storage and transmission for the file types in order to obtain the maximum compression yield.", "published": "2023-07-08 02:36:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12275v1", "categories": ["cs.OH", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.OH"}
{"title": "dYdX: Liquidity Providers' Incentive Programme Review", "abstract": "Liquidity providers are currently incentivised to provide liquidity through the LP Incentives Programme on dYdX. Based on the various parameters - makerVolume, depths and spreads, they are rewarded accordingly based on their activities. Given the maturity of the BTC and ETH markets, alongside other altcoins which enjoy a consistent amount of liquidity, this paper aims to update the formula to encourage more active and efficient liquidity, improving the overall trading experience. In this research, I begin by providing a basic understanding of spread management, before introducing the methodology with the various metrics and conditions. This includes gathering orderbooks on a minute interval and reconstructing the depths based on historical trades to establish an upper bound. I end off by providing recommendations to update the maxSpread parameter and alternative mechanisms/solutions to improve the existing market structures.", "published": "2023-07-08 08:51:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03935v1", "categories": ["q-fin.GN", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.GN"}
