{"title": "A Note on Functional Averages over Gaussian Ensembles", "abstract": "In this work we find a new formula for matrix averages over the Gaussian ensemble. Let ${\\bf H}$ be an $n\\times n$ Gaussian random matrix with complex, independent, and identically distributed entries of zero mean and unit variance. Given an $n\\times n$ positive definite matrix ${\\bf A}$, and a continuous function $f:\\R^{+}\\to\\R$ such that $\\int_{0}^{\\infty}{e^{-\u03b1t}|f(t)|^2\\,dt}<\\infty$ for every $\u03b1>0$, we find a new formula for the expectation $\\E[\\mathrm{Tr}(f({\\bf HAH^{*}}))]$. Taking $f(x)=\\log(1+x)$ gives another formula for the capacity of the MIMO communication channel, and taking $f(x)=(1+x)^{-1}$ gives the MMSE achieved by a linear receiver.", "published": "2009-10-03 22:25:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.0575v6", "categories": ["math.PR", "cs.IT", "math.OA"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
