{"title": "Model Free Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Stationary Mean field Equilibrium for Multiple Types of Agents", "abstract": "We consider a multi-agent Markov strategic interaction over an infinite horizon where agents can be of multiple types. We model the strategic interaction as a mean-field game in the asymptotic limit when the number of agents of each type becomes infinite. Each agent has a private state; the state evolves depending on the distribution of the state of the agents of different types and the action of the agent. Each agent wants to maximize the discounted sum of rewards over the infinite horizon which depends on the state of the agent and the distribution of the state of the leaders and followers. We seek to characterize and compute a stationary multi-type Mean field equilibrium (MMFE) in the above game. We characterize the conditions under which a stationary MMFE exists. Finally, we propose Reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm using policy gradient approach to find the stationary MMFE when the agents are unaware of the dynamics. We, numerically, evaluate how such kind of interaction can model the cyber attacks among defenders and adversaries, and show how RL based algorithm can converge to an equilibrium.", "published": "2020-12-31 00:12:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15377v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.GT", "cs.LG", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Partially Observable Mean Field Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are not scalable to environments with more than a few agents, since these algorithms are exponential in the number of agents. Recent research has introduced successful methods to scale multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to many agent scenarios using mean field theory. Previous work in this field assumes that an agent has access to exact cumulative metrics regarding the mean field behaviour of the system, which it can then use to take its actions. In this paper, we relax this assumption and maintain a distribution to model the uncertainty regarding the mean field of the system. We consider two different settings for this problem. In the first setting, only agents in a fixed neighbourhood are visible, while in the second setting, the visibility of agents is determined at random based on distances. For each of these settings, we introduce a Q-learning based algorithm that can learn effectively. We prove that this Q-learning estimate stays very close to the Nash Q-value (under a common set of assumptions) for the first setting. We also empirically show our algorithms outperform multiple baselines in three different games in the MAgents framework, which supports large environments with many agents learning simultaneously to achieve possibly distinct goals.", "published": "2020-12-31 18:12:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15791v3", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
