{"title": "The generalized Pythagorean theorem on the compactifications of certain dually flat spaces via toric geometry", "abstract": "In this paper we study dually flat spaces arising from Delzant polytopes equipped with a symplectic potential together with their corresponding toric K\u00e4hler manifolds as their torifications.We introduce a dually flat structure and the associated Bregman divergence on the boundary from the viewpoint of toric K\u00e4hler geometry. We show a continuity and a generalized Pythagorean theorem for the divergence on the boundary. We also provide a characterization for a toric K\u00e4hler manifold to become a torification of a mixture family on a finite set.", "published": "2023-05-15 08:04:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08422v4", "categories": ["math.SG", "cs.IT", "math.DG"], "primary_category": "math.SG"}
