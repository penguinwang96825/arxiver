{"title": "CONATION: English Command Input/Output System for Computers", "abstract": "In this information technology age, a convenient and user friendly interface\nis required to operate the computer system on very fast rate. In the human\nbeing, speech being a natural mode of communication has potential to being a\nfast and convenient mode of interaction with computer. Speech recognition will\nplay an important role in taking technology to them. It is the need of this era\nto access the information within seconds. This paper describes the design and\ndevelopment of speaker independent and English command interpreted system for\ncomputers. HMM model is used to represent the phoneme like speech commands.\nExperiments have been done on real world data and system has been trained in\nnormal condition for real world subject.", "published": "2013-05-03 06:25:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0625v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
