{"title": "Deep Hedging Bermudan Swaptions", "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a novel approach to Bermudan swaption hedging by\napplying the deep hedging framework to address limitations of traditional\narbitrage-free methods. Conventional methods assume ideal conditions, such as\nzero transaction costs, perfect liquidity, and continuous-time hedging, which\noften differ from real market environments. This discrepancy can lead to\nresidual profit and loss (P&L), resulting in two primary issues. First,\nresidual P&L may prevent achieving the initial model price, especially with\nimproper parameter settings, potentially causing a negative P&L trend and\nsignificant financial impacts. Second, controlling the distribution of residual\nP&L to mitigate downside risk is challenging, as hedged positions may become\ncurve gamma-short, making them vulnerable to large interest rate movements. The\ndeep hedging approach enables flexible selection of convex risk measures and\nhedge strategies, allowing for improved residual P&L management. This study\nalso addresses challenges in applying the deep hedging approach to Bermudan\nswaptions, such as efficient arbitrage-free market scenario generation and\nmanaging early exercise conditions. Additionally, we introduce a unique \"Option\nSpread Hedge\" strategy, which allows for robust hedging and provides intuitive\ninterpretability. Numerical analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach.", "published": "2024-11-15 09:46:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10079v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Guided Learning: Lubricating End-to-End Modeling for Multi-stage Decision-making", "abstract": "Multi-stage decision-making is crucial in various real-world artificial\nintelligence applications, including recommendation systems, autonomous\ndriving, and quantitative investment systems. In quantitative investment, for\nexample, the process typically involves several sequential stages such as\nfactor mining, alpha prediction, portfolio optimization, and sometimes order\nexecution. While state-of-the-art end-to-end modeling aims to unify these\nstages into a single global framework, it faces significant challenges: (1)\ntraining such a unified neural network consisting of multiple stages between\ninitial inputs and final outputs often leads to suboptimal solutions, or even\ncollapse, and (2) many decision-making scenarios are not easily reducible to\nstandard prediction problems. To overcome these challenges, we propose Guided\nLearning, a novel methodological framework designed to enhance end-to-end\nlearning in multi-stage decision-making. We introduce the concept of a\n``guide'', a function that induces the training of intermediate neural network\nlayers towards some phased goals, directing gradients away from suboptimal\ncollapse. For decision scenarios lacking explicit supervisory labels, we\nincorporate a utility function that quantifies the ``reward'' of the throughout\ndecision. Additionally, we explore the connections between Guided Learning and\nclassic machine learning paradigms such as supervised, unsupervised,\nsemi-supervised, multi-task, and reinforcement learning. Experiments on\nquantitative investment strategy building demonstrate that guided learning\nsignificantly outperforms both traditional stage-wise approaches and existing\nend-to-end methods.", "published": "2024-11-15 06:54:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10496v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Refined and Segmented Price Sentiment Indices from Survey Comments", "abstract": "We aim to enhance a price sentiment index and to more precisely understand\nprice trends from the perspective of not only consumers but also businesses. We\nextract comments related to prices from the Economy Watchers Survey conducted\nby the Cabinet Office of Japan and classify price trends using a large language\nmodel (LLM). We classify whether the survey sample reflects the perspective of\nconsumers or businesses, and whether the comments pertain to goods or services\nby utilizing information on the fields of comments and the industries of\nrespondents included in the Economy Watchers Survey. From these classified\nprice-related comments, we construct price sentiment indices not only for a\ngeneral purpose but also for more specific objectives by combining perspectives\non consumers and prices, as well as goods and services. It becomes possible to\nachieve a more accurate classification of price directions by employing a LLM\nfor classification. Furthermore, integrating the outputs of multiple LLMs\nsuggests the potential for the better performance of the classification. The\nuse of more accurately classified comments allows for the construction of an\nindex with a higher correlation to existing indices than previous studies. We\ndemonstrate that the correlation of the price index for consumers, which has a\nlarger sample size, is further enhanced by selecting comments for aggregation\nbased on the industry of the survey respondents.", "published": "2024-11-15 04:22:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09937v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Portfolio Optimization with Feedback Strategies Based on Artificial Neural Networks", "abstract": "With the recent advancements in machine learning (ML), artificial neural\nnetworks (ANN) are starting to play an increasingly important role in\nquantitative finance. Dynamic portfolio optimization is among many problems\nthat have significantly benefited from a wider adoption of deep learning (DL).\nWhile most existing research has primarily focused on how DL can alleviate the\ncurse of dimensionality when solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)\nequation, some very recent developments propose to forego derivation and\nsolution of HJB in favor of empirical utility maximization over dynamic\nallocation strategies expressed through ANN. In addition to being simple and\ntransparent, this approach is universally applicable, as it is essentially\nagnostic about market dynamics. To showcase the method, we apply it to optimal\nportfolio allocation between a cash account and the S&P 500 index modeled using\ngeometric Brownian motion or the Heston model. In both cases, the results are\ndemonstrated to be on par with those under the theoretical optimal weights\nassuming isoelastic utility and real-time rebalancing. A set of R codes for a\nbroad class of stochastic volatility models are provided as a supplement.", "published": "2024-11-15 02:46:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09899v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.CP", "91G10, 91G60, 91G80, 62M45, 49M25"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
{"title": "The role of debt valuation factors in systemic risk assessment", "abstract": "The fragility of financial systems was starkly demonstrated in early 2023\nthrough a cascade of major bank failures in the United States, including the\nsecond, third, and fourth largest collapses in the US history. The highly\ninterdependent financial networks and the associated high systemic risk have\nbeen deemed the cause of the crashes. The goal of this paper is to enhance\nexisting systemic risk analysis frameworks by incorporating essential debt\nvaluation factors. Our results demonstrate that these additional elements\nsubstantially influence the outcomes of risk assessment. Notably, by modeling\nthe dynamic relationship between interest rates and banks' credibility, our\nframework can detect potential cascading failures that standard approaches\nmight miss. The proposed risk assessment methodology can help regulatory bodies\nprevent future failures, while also allowing companies to more accurately\npredict turmoil periods and strengthen their survivability during such events.", "published": "2024-11-15 17:48:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10386v2", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "Optimal portfolio under ratio-type periodic evaluation in stochastic factor models under convex trading constraints", "abstract": "This paper studies a type of periodic utility maximization problems for\nportfolio management in incomplete stochastic factor models with convex trading\nconstraints. The portfolio performance is periodically evaluated on the\nrelative ratio of two adjacent wealth levels over an infinite horizon,\nfeaturing the dynamic adjustments in portfolio decision according to past\nachievements. Under power utility, we transform the original infinite horizon\noptimal control problem into an auxiliary terminal wealth optimization problem\nunder a modified utility function. To cope with the convex trading constraints,\nwe further introduce an auxiliary unconstrained optimization problem in a\nmodified market model and develop the martingale duality approach to establish\nthe existence of the dual minimizer such that the optimal unconstrained wealth\nprocess can be obtained using the dual representation. With the help of the\nduality results in the auxiliary problems, the relationship between the\nconstrained and unconstrained models as well as some fixed point arguments, we\nfinally derive and verify the optimal constrained portfolio process in a\nperiodic manner for the original problem over an infinite horizon.", "published": "2024-11-15 13:19:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13579v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
