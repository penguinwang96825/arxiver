{"title": "Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Convex Risk Measures", "abstract": "We develop an approach for solving time-consistent risk-sensitive stochastic optimization problems using model-free reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we assume agents assess the risk of a sequence of random variables using dynamic convex risk measures. We employ a time-consistent dynamic programming principle to determine the value of a particular policy, and develop policy gradient update rules that aid in obtaining optimal policies. We further develop an actor-critic style algorithm using neural networks to optimize over policies. Finally, we demonstrate the performance and flexibility of our approach by applying it to three optimization problems: statistical arbitrage trading strategies, financial hedging, and obstacle avoidance robot control.", "published": "2021-12-26 16:41:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13414v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
