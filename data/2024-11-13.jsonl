{"title": "FinRobot: AI Agent for Equity Research and Valuation with Large Language Models", "abstract": "As financial markets grow increasingly complex, there is a rising need for\nautomated tools that can effectively assist human analysts in equity research,\nparticularly within sell-side research. While Generative AI (GenAI) has\nattracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall\nshort due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for\ndiscretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new\ndata in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical\nvalue for investors.\n  This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically\ndesigned for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought\n(CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate\nthe comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around\nthree specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data\nsources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics\nan analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT\nAgent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and\nreport. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise\nnumerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk\nassessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research\nremains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information.\nUnlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright\nReports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major\nbrokerage firms and fundamental research vendors.

{"title": "Robot See, Robot Do: Imitation Reward for Noisy Financial Environments", "abstract": "The sequential nature of decision-making in financial asset trading aligns\nnaturally with the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, making RL a common\napproach in this domain. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio in financial\nmarkets results in noisy estimates of environment components, including the\nreward function, which hinders effective policy learning by RL agents. Given\nthe critical importance of reward function design in RL problems, this paper\nintroduces a novel and more robust reward function by leveraging imitation\nlearning, where a trend labeling algorithm acts as an expert. We integrate\nimitation (expert's) feedback with reinforcement (agent's) feedback in a\nmodel-free RL algorithm, effectively embedding the imitation learning problem\nwithin the RL paradigm to handle the stochasticity of reward signals. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that this novel approach improves financial performance\nmetrics compared to traditional benchmarks and RL agents trained solely using\nreinforcement feedback.", "published": "2024-11-13 14:24:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08637v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.RO", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
