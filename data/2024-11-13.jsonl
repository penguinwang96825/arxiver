{"title": "FinRobot: AI Agent for Equity Research and Valuation with Large Language Models", "abstract": "As financial markets grow increasingly complex, there is a rising need for\nautomated tools that can effectively assist human analysts in equity research,\nparticularly within sell-side research. While Generative AI (GenAI) has\nattracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall\nshort due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for\ndiscretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new\ndata in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical\nvalue for investors.\n  This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically\ndesigned for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought\n(CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate\nthe comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around\nthree specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data\nsources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics\nan analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT\nAgent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and\nreport. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise\nnumerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk\nassessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research\nremains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information.\nUnlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright\nReports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major\nbrokerage firms and fundamental research vendors.

{"title": "Analyst Reports and Stock Performance: Evidence from the Chinese Market", "abstract": "This article applies natural language processing (NLP) to extract and\nquantify textual information to predict stock performance. Using an extensive\ndataset of Chinese analyst reports and employing a customized BERT deep\nlearning model for Chinese text, this study categorizes the sentiment of the\nreports as positive, neutral, or negative. The findings underscore the\npredictive capacity of this sentiment indicator for stock volatility, excess\nreturns, and trading volume. Specifically, analyst reports with strong positive\nsentiment will increase excess return and intraday volatility, and vice versa,\nreports with strong negative sentiment also increase volatility and trading\nvolume, but decrease future excess return. The magnitude of this effect is\ngreater for positive sentiment reports than for negative sentiment reports.\nThis article contributes to the empirical literature on sentiment analysis and\nthe response of the stock market to news in the Chinese stock market.", "published": "2024-11-13 16:08:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08726v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Quantifying Qualitative Insights: Leveraging LLMs to Market Predict", "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to\ntransform financial analytics by integrating numerical and textual data.\nHowever, challenges such as insufficient context when fusing multimodal\ninformation and the difficulty in measuring the utility of qualitative outputs,\nwhich LLMs generate as text, have limited their effectiveness in tasks such as\nfinancial forecasting. This study addresses these challenges by leveraging\ndaily reports from securities firms to create high-quality contextual\ninformation. The reports are segmented into text-based key factors and combined\nwith numerical data, such as price information, to form context sets. By\ndynamically updating few-shot examples based on the query time, the sets\nincorporate the latest information, forming a highly relevant set closely\naligned with the query point. Additionally, a crafted prompt is designed to\nassign scores to the key factors, converting qualitative insights into\nquantitative results. The derived scores undergo a scaling process,\ntransforming them into real-world values that are used for prediction. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that LLMs outperform time-series models in market\nforecasting, though challenges such as imperfect reproducibility and limited\nexplainability remain.", "published": "2024-11-13 07:45:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08404v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Hybrid Vector Auto Regression and Neural Network Model for Order Flow Imbalance Prediction in High Frequency Trading", "abstract": "In high frequency trading, accurate prediction of Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)\nis crucial for understanding market dynamics and maintaining liquidity. This\npaper introduces a hybrid predictive model that combines Vector Auto Regression\n(VAR) with a simple feedforward neural network (FNN) to forecast OFI and assess\ntrading intensity. The VAR component captures linear dependencies, while\nresiduals are fed into the FNN to model non-linear patterns, enabling a\ncomprehensive approach to OFI prediction. Additionally, the model calculates\nthe intensity on the Buy or Sell side, providing insights into which side holds\ngreater trading pressure. These insights facilitate the development of trading\nstrategies by identifying periods of high buy or sell intensity. Using both\nsynthetic and real trading data from Binance, we demonstrate that the hybrid\nmodel offers significant improvements in predictive accuracy and enhances\nstrategic decision-making based on OFI dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the\nhybrid models performance with standalone FNN and VAR models, showing that the\nhybrid approach achieves superior forecasting accuracy across both synthetic\nand real datasets, making it the most effective model for OFI prediction in\nhigh frequency trading.", "published": "2024-11-13 07:06:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08382v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Multi-asset return risk measures", "abstract": "We revisit the recently introduced concept of return risk measures (RRMs). We\nextend it by allowing risk management via multiple so-called eligible assets.\nThe resulting new risk measures are called multi-asset return risk measures\n(MARRMs). We analyze properties of these risk measures. In particular, we prove\nthat a positively homogeneous MARRM is quasi-convex if and only if it is\nconvex. Furthermore, we state conditions to avoid inconsistent risk\nevaluations. Then, we point out the connection between MARRMs and the\nwell-known concept of multi-asset risk measures (MARMs). This is used to obtain\nvarious dual representations of MARRMs. Moreover, we compare RRMs, MARMs, and\nMARRMs in numerous case studies. First, using typical continuous-time financial\nmarkets and different notions of acceptability of losses, we compare MARRMs and\nMARMs and draw conclusions about the cost of risk mitigation. Second, in a\nreal-world example, we compare the relative difference between RRMs and MARRMs\nin times of crisis.", "published": "2024-11-13 16:49:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08763v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Robot See, Robot Do: Imitation Reward for Noisy Financial Environments", "abstract": "The sequential nature of decision-making in financial asset trading aligns\nnaturally with the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, making RL a common\napproach in this domain. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio in financial\nmarkets results in noisy estimates of environment components, including the\nreward function, which hinders effective policy learning by RL agents. Given\nthe critical importance of reward function design in RL problems, this paper\nintroduces a novel and more robust reward function by leveraging imitation\nlearning, where a trend labeling algorithm acts as an expert. We integrate\nimitation (expert's) feedback with reinforcement (agent's) feedback in a\nmodel-free RL algorithm, effectively embedding the imitation learning problem\nwithin the RL paradigm to handle the stochasticity of reward signals. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that this novel approach improves financial performance\nmetrics compared to traditional benchmarks and RL agents trained solely using\nreinforcement feedback.", "published": "2024-11-13 14:24:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08637v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.RO", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
