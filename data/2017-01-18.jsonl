{"title": "Assessing User Expertise in Spoken Dialog System Interactions", "abstract": "Identifying the level of expertise of its users is important for a system\nsince it can lead to a better interaction through adaptation techniques.\nFurthermore, this information can be used in offline processes of root cause\nanalysis. However, not much effort has been put into automatically identifying\nthe level of expertise of an user, especially in dialog-based interactions. In\nthis paper we present an approach based on a specific set of task related\nfeatures. Based on the distribution of the features among the two classes -\nNovice and Expert - we used Random Forests as a classification approach.\nFurthermore, we used a Support Vector Machine classifier, in order to perform a\nresult comparison. By applying these approaches on data from a real system,\nLet's Go, we obtained preliminary results that we consider positive, given the\ndifficulty of the task and the lack of competing approaches for comparison.", "published": "2017-01-18 11:10:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05011v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "H.1.2; I.2.1; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
