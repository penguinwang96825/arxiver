{"title": "Exploring the Hierarchy in Relation Labels for Scene Graph Generation", "abstract": "By assigning each relationship a single label, current approaches formulate the relationship detection as a classification problem. Under this formulation, predicate categories are treated as completely different classes. However, different from the object labels where different classes have explicit boundaries, predicates usually have overlaps in their semantic meanings. For example, sit\\_on and stand\\_on have common meanings in vertical relationships but different details of how these two objects are vertically placed. In order to leverage the inherent structures of the predicate categories, we propose to first build the language hierarchy and then utilize the Hierarchy Guided Feature Learning (HGFL) strategy to learn better region features of both the coarse-grained level and the fine-grained level. Besides, we also propose the Hierarchy Guided Module (HGM) to utilize the coarse-grained level to guide the learning of fine-grained level features. Experiments show that the proposed simple yet effective method can improve several state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin (up to $33\\%$ relative gain) in terms of Recall@50 on the task of Scene Graph Generation in different datasets.", "published": "2020-09-12 17:36:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05834v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Automatic Differentiation to Simultaneously Identify Nonlinear Dynamics and Extract Noise Probability Distributions from Data", "abstract": "The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) is a regression framework for the discovery of parsimonious dynamic models and governing equations from time-series data. As with all system identification methods, noisy measurements compromise the accuracy and robustness of the model discovery procedure. In this work, we develop a variant of the SINDy algorithm that integrates automatic differentiation and recent time-stepping constrained motivated by Rudy et al. for simultaneously (i) denoising the data, (ii) learning and parametrizing the noise probability distribution, and (iii) identifying the underlying parsimonious dynamical system responsible for generating the time-series data. Thus within an integrated optimization framework, noise can be separated from signal, resulting in an architecture that is approximately twice as robust to noise as state-of-the-art methods, handling as much as 40% noise on a given time-series signal and explicitly parametrizing the noise probability distribution. We demonstrate this approach on several numerical examples, from Lotka-Volterra models to the spatio-temporal Lorenz 96 model. Further, we show the method can identify a diversity of probability distributions including Gaussian, uniform, Gamma, and Rayleigh.", "published": "2020-09-12 23:52:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08810v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG", "math.DS"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
