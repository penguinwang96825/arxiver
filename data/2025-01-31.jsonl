{"title": "TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models", "abstract": "Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical\nnoise, nonlinearity, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely\nhard. We address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order\nBook (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and\ntesting trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and\ngenerating synthetic market data. Previous works lack realism, usefulness, and\nresponsiveness of the generated simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a\nnovel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB\nSimulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows conditioned on the\nstate of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures\nthe temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There\nis a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market\nsimulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the\npredictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, by training a stock price\npredictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare\nTRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting an x3.27 and x3.47\nimprovement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we\ngenerate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. We assess\nTRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it\neffectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to\nan experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations\nof trading strategies and market impact experiments. We developed DeepMarket,\nthe first open-source Python framework for market simulation with deep\nlearning. Our repository includes a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's\ngenerates simulations. We release the code at\ngithub.com/LeonardoBerti00/DeepMarket.", "published": "2025-01-31 19:43:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Year-over-Year Developments in Financial Fraud Detection via Deep Learning: A Systematic Literature Review", "abstract": "This paper systematically reviews advancements in deep learning (DL)\ntechniques for financial fraud detection, a critical issue in the financial\nsector. Using the Kitchenham systematic literature review approach, 57 studies\npublished between 2019 and 2024 were analyzed. The review highlights the\neffectiveness of various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural\nNetworks, Long Short-Term Memory, and transformers across domains such as\ncredit card transactions, insurance claims, and financial statement audits.\nPerformance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were\nevaluated. Key themes explored include the impact of data privacy frameworks\nand advancements in feature engineering and data preprocessing. The study\nemphasizes challenges such as imbalanced datasets, model interpretability, and\nethical considerations, alongside opportunities for automation and\nprivacy-preserving techniques such as blockchain integration and Principal\nComponent Analysis. By examining trends over the past five years, this review\nidentifies critical gaps and promising directions for advancing DL applications\nin financial fraud detection, offering actionable insights for researchers and\npractitioners.", "published": "2025-01-31 22:31:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00201v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
