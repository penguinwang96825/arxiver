{"title": "A Lemma Based Evaluator for Semitic Language Text Summarization Systems", "abstract": "Matching texts in highly inflected languages such as Arabic by simple\nstemming strategy is unlikely to perform well. In this paper, we present a\nstrategy for automatic text matching technique for for inflectional languages,\nusing Arabic as the test case. The system is an extension of ROUGE test in\nwhich texts are matched on token's lemma level. The experimental results show\nan enhancement of detecting similarities between different sentences having\nsame semantics but written in different lexical forms..", "published": "2014-03-22 00:13:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5596v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
