{"title": "Corpora Preparation and Stopword List Generation for Arabic data in\n  Social Network", "abstract": "This paper proposes a methodology to prepare corpora in Arabic language from\nonline social network (OSN) and review site for Sentiment Analysis (SA) task.\nThe paper also proposes a methodology for generating a stopword list from the\nprepared corpora. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of removing\nstopwords on the SA task. The problem is that the stopwords lists generated\nbefore were on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is not the common language\nused in OSN. We have generated a stopword list of Egyptian dialect and a\ncorpus-based list to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare the efficiency of\ntext classification when using the generated lists along with previously\ngenerated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA\nlist. The text classification was performed using Na\\\"ive Bayes and Decision\nTree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigram. The\nexperiments show that the general lists containing the Egyptian dialects words\ngive better performance than using lists of MSA stopwords only.", "published": "2014-10-05 09:02:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1135v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Language-based Examples in the Statistics Classroom", "abstract": "Statistics pedagogy values using a variety of examples. Thanks to text\nresources on the Web, and since statistical packages have the ability to\nanalyze string data, it is now easy to use language-based examples in a\nstatistics class. Three such examples are discussed here. First, many types of\nwordplay (e.g., crosswords and hangman) involve finding words with letters that\nsatisfy a certain pattern. Second, linguistics has shown that idiomatic pairs\nof words often appear together more frequently than chance. For example, in the\nBrown Corpus, this is true of the phrasal verb to throw up (p-value=7.92E-10.)\nThird, a pangram contains all the letters of the alphabet at least once. These\nare searched for in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and their lengths are\ncompared to the expected value given by the unequal probability coupon\ncollector's problem as well as simulations.", "published": "2014-10-05 01:36:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2149v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
