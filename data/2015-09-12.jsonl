{"title": "Improving distant supervision using inference learning", "abstract": "Distant supervision is a widely applied approach to automatic training of\nrelation extraction systems and has the advantage that it can generate large\namounts of labelled data with minimal effort. However, this data may contain\nerrors and consequently systems trained using distant supervision tend not to\nperform as well as those based on manually labelled data. This work proposes a\nnovel method for detecting potential false negative training examples using a\nknowledge inference method. Results show that our approach improves the\nperformance of relation extraction systems trained using distantly supervised\ndata.", "published": "2015-09-12 12:59:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03739v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Kannada named entity recognition and classification (nerc) based on\n  multinomial na\u00efve bayes (mnb) classifier", "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) is a process of\nidentification of proper nouns in the text and classification of those nouns\ninto certain predefined categories like person name, location, organization,\ndate, and time etc. NERC in Kannada is an essential and challenging task. The\naim of this work is to develop a novel model for NERC, based on Multinomial\nNa\\\"ive Bayes (MNB) Classifier. The Methodology adopted in this paper is based\non feature extraction of training corpus, by using term frequency, inverse\ndocument frequency and fitting them to a tf-idf-vectorizer. The paper discusses\nthe various issues in developing the proposed model. The details of\nimplementation and performance evaluation are discussed. The experiments are\nconducted on a training corpus of size 95,170 tokens and test corpus of 5,000\ntokens. It is observed that the model works with Precision, Recall and\nF1-measure of 83%, 79% and 81% respectively.", "published": "2015-09-12 06:07:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04385v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
