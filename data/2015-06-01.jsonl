{"title": "Modeling Relation Paths for Representation Learning of Knowledge Bases", "abstract": "Representation learning of knowledge bases (KBs) aims to embed both entities\nand relations into a low-dimensional space. Most existing methods only consider\ndirect relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step\nrelation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and\npropose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers\nrelation paths as translations between entities for representation learning,\nand addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are\nreliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure\nthe reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic\ncomposition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets\nshow that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and\nconsistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction\nfrom text.", "published": "2015-06-01 08:22:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00379v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Monolingually Derived Phrase Scores for Phrase Based SMT Using Neural\n  Networks Vector Representations", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose two new features for estimating phrase-based\nmachine translation parameters from mainly monolingual data. Our method is\nbased on two recently introduced neural network vector representation models\nfor words and sentences. It is the first time that these models have been used\nin an end to end phrase-based machine translation system. Scores obtained from\nour method can recover more than 80% of BLEU loss caused by removing phrase\ntable probabilities. We also show that our features combined with the phrase\ntable probabilities improve the BLEU score by absolute 0.74 points.", "published": "2015-06-01 09:36:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00406v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Statistical Machine Translation Features with Multitask Tensor Networks", "abstract": "We present a three-pronged approach to improving Statistical Machine\nTranslation (SMT), building on recent success in the application of neural\nnetworks to SMT. First, we propose new features based on neural networks to\nmodel various non-local translation phenomena. Second, we augment the\narchitecture of the neural network with tensor layers that capture important\nhigher-order interaction among the network units. Third, we apply multitask\nlearning to estimate the neural network parameters jointly. Each of our\nproposed methods results in significant improvements that are complementary.\nThe overall improvement is +2.7 and +1.8 BLEU points for Arabic-English and\nChinese-English translation over a state-of-the-art system that already\nincludes neural network features.", "published": "2015-06-01 22:52:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00698v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning to Answer Questions From Image Using Convolutional Neural\n  Network", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to employ the convolutional neural network (CNN)\nfor the image question answering (QA). Our proposed CNN provides an end-to-end\nframework with convolutional architectures for learning not only the image and\nquestion representations, but also their inter-modal interactions to produce\nthe answer. More specifically, our model consists of three CNNs: one image CNN\nto encode the image content, one sentence CNN to compose the words of the\nquestion, and one multimodal convolution layer to learn their joint\nrepresentation for the classification in the space of candidate answer words.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model on the DAQUAR and COCO-QA\ndatasets, which are two benchmark datasets for the image QA, with the\nperformances significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.", "published": "2015-06-01 03:09:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00333v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "How much is said in a microblog? A multilingual inquiry based on Weibo\n  and Twitter", "abstract": "This paper presents a multilingual study on, per single post of microblog\ntext, (a) how much can be said, (b) how much is written in terms of characters\nand bytes, and (c) how much is said in terms of information content in posts by\ndifferent organizations in different languages. Focusing on three different\nlanguages (English, Chinese, and Japanese), this research analyses Weibo and\nTwitter accounts of major embassies and news agencies. We first establish our\ncriterion for quantifying \"how much can be said\" in a digital text based on the\nopenly available Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the translated\nsubtitles from TED talks. These parallel corpora allow us to determine the\nnumber of characters and bits needed to represent the same content in different\nlanguages and character encodings. We then derive the amount of information\nthat is actually contained in microblog posts authored by selected accounts on\nWeibo and Twitter. Our results confirm that languages with larger character\nsets such as Chinese and Japanese contain more information per character than\nEnglish, but the actual information content contained within a microblog text\nvaries depending on both the type of organization and the language of the post.\nWe conclude with a discussion on the design implications of microblog text\nlimits for different languages.", "published": "2015-06-01 17:06:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00572v2", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "H.5.3, H.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
