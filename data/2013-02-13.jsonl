{"title": "Building a reordering system using tree-to-string hierarchical model", "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to the First Workshop on Reordering for\nStatistical Machine Translation. We have decided to build a reordering system\nbased on tree-to-string model, using only publicly available tools to\naccomplish this task. With the provided training data we have built a\ntranslation model using Moses toolkit, and then we applied a chart decoder,\nimplemented in Moses, to reorder the sentences. Even though our submission only\ncovered English-Farsi language pair, we believe that the approach itself should\nwork regardless of the choice of the languages, so we have also carried out the\nexperiments for English-Italian and English-Urdu. For these language pairs we\nhave noticed a significant improvement over the baseline in BLEU, Kendall-Tau\nand Hamming metrics. A detailed description is given, so that everyone can\nreproduce our results. Also, some possible directions for further improvements\nare discussed.", "published": "2013-02-13 11:54:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3057v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
