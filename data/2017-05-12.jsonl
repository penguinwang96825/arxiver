{"title": "Evaluating vector-space models of analogy", "abstract": "Vector-space representations provide geometric tools for reasoning about the\nsimilarity of a set of objects and their relationships. Recent machine learning\nmethods for deriving vector-space embeddings of words (e.g., word2vec) have\nachieved considerable success in natural language processing. These vector\nspaces have also been shown to exhibit a surprising capacity to capture verbal\nanalogies, with similar results for natural images, giving new life to a\nclassic model of analogies as parallelograms that was first proposed by\ncognitive scientists. We evaluate the parallelogram model of analogy as applied\nto modern word embeddings, providing a detailed analysis of the extent to which\nthis approach captures human relational similarity judgments in a large\nbenchmark dataset. We find that that some semantic relationships are better\ncaptured than others. We then provide evidence for deeper limitations of the\nparallelogram model based on the intrinsic geometric constraints of vector\nspaces, paralleling classic results for first-order similarity.", "published": "2017-05-12 01:26:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04416v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Arc-swift: A Novel Transition System for Dependency Parsing", "abstract": "Transition-based dependency parsers often need sequences of local shift and\nreduce operations to produce certain attachments. Correct individual decisions\nhence require global information about the sentence context and mistakes cause\nerror propagation. This paper proposes a novel transition system, arc-swift,\nthat enables direct attachments between tokens farther apart with a single\ntransition. This allows the parser to leverage lexical information more\ndirectly in transition decisions. Hence, arc-swift can achieve significantly\nbetter performance with a very small beam size. Our parsers reduce error by\n3.7--7.6% relative to those using existing transition systems on the Penn\nTreebank dependency parsing task and English Universal Dependencies.", "published": "2017-05-12 03:44:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04434v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
