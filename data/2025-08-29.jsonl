{"title": "Normality and the Turing Test", "abstract": "This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of\nnormality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.", "published": "2025-08-29 07:55:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21382v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

However, long post-click\nbehavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume\nof data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training\nand inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage\napproaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete\nutilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating\nmultimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents\nsignificant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens\nand mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences\ncontain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps,\nDMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete\nlifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no\nadditional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing\nmultimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from\ngrouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors\nwithin each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers\nto capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally\nordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests.

A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the\nmodel after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs\nprohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine\nunlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove\nsensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.\nRecently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by\nintegrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information\nto identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA\nadapters for updates.

We have derived the closed-form expressions of\nthe probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on\nthe Inverse Gaussian (\\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration\nand mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based\nclosed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first\ntime. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation\npaths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to\naverage SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on\ndevice-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we\nshould consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment\nstrategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device\naverage SNR.", "published": "2025-08-29 13:29:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

{"title": "Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals", "abstract": "Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation\nfor capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on\nirregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known\nspectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral\nsupport requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may\nextract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not\nfriendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of\nvertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random\nsampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of\nrows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that\nsubmatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the\noriginal FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a\nreconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness\npriors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the\neffectiveness of the framework through experiments.", "published": "2025-08-29 08:34:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

For a jointly bandlimited\nTVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which\ndepends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier\nspectral domain.

{"title": "Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison", "abstract": "We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over\ndelay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)\ncommunications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection\nfor different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through\na common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and\ncomprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels\nand similar receiver complexities.\n  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE\nalgorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via\ntwo approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order\napproximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol\ndetection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios\nfor the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)\nscheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \\emph{virtual} pilots to further\nimprove the CE and data detection accuracy.\n  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE\nand data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in\nuncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier\nequalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while\nOFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS\nperform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,\ninterestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver\nis employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is\nconstrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel\nconditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these\ndifferences disappear.", "published": "2025-08-29 07:33:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Hybrid Codebook Design for Localization Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System", "abstract": "Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce\nadditional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically\nsteering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in\nwireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which\nadjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM\ncharacteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing\nstudies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores\nits application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station\nserves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability\nparadigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired\nbeampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state\nselection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set\nof patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM\nprecoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case\nwe derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM\nprecoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and\npropose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern\nselection.
