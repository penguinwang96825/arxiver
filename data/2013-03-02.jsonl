{"title": "Structure-semantics interplay in complex networks and its effects on the\n  predictability of similarity in texts", "abstract": "There are different ways to define similarity for grouping similar texts into\nclusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task.\nFor instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same\nsemantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be\nconsidered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing\nconcepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic\nand even pragmatic features. The interplay between the various metrics of the\ncomplex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of\nmachine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated\ntexts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of\nthe networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify MT systems\nin particular cases. For evaluating the quality of MT texts, on the other hand,\nhigh correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics.\nThis was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on\nword co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves\nsemantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest\ncorrelation with the NIST measurement, indicating that in some cases the\ncombination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in\nMT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in\nsome contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were\nobtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing\nsemantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe\nthat the methodology proposed here may be useful to enhance text classification\nconsiderably, as it combines well-established strategies.", "published": "2013-03-02 04:26:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0350v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Probing the statistical properties of unknown texts: application to the\n  Voynich Manuscript", "abstract": "While the use of statistical physics methods to analyze large corpora has\nbeen useful to unveil many patterns in texts, no comprehensive investigation\nhas been performed investigating the properties of statistical measurements\nacross different languages and texts. In this study we propose a framework that\naims at determining if a text is compatible with a natural language and which\nlanguages are closest to it, without any knowledge of the meaning of the words.\nThe approach is based on three types of statistical measurements, i.e. obtained\nfrom first-order statistics of word properties in a text, from the topology of\ncomplex networks representing text, and from intermittency concepts where text\nis treated as a time series. Comparative experiments were performed with the\nNew Testament in 15 different languages and with distinct books in English and\nPortuguese in order to quantify the dependency of the different measurements on\nthe language and on the story being told in the book. The metrics found to be\ninformative in distinguishing real texts from their shuffled versions include\nassortativity, degree and selectivity of words. As an illustration, we analyze\nan undeciphered medieval manuscript known as the Voynich Manuscript. We show\nthat it is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with\nrandom texts. We also obtain candidates for key-words of the Voynich Manuscript\nwhich could be helpful in the effort of deciphering it. Because we were able to\nidentify statistical measurements that are more dependent on the syntax than on\nthe semantics, the framework may also serve for text analysis in\nlanguage-dependent applications.", "published": "2013-03-02 03:57:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0347v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
