{"title": "Inside the Mind of Investors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from the StockTwits Data", "abstract": "We study the investor beliefs, sentiment and disagreement, about stock market returns during the COVID-19 pandemic using a large number of messages of investors on a social media investing platform, \\textit{StockTwits}. The rich and multimodal features of StockTwits data allow us to explore the evolution of sentiment and disagreement within and across investors, sectors, and even industries. We find that the sentiment (disagreement) has a sharp decrease (increase) across all investors with any investment philosophy, horizon, and experience between February 19, 2020, and March 23, 2020, where a historical market high followed by a record drop. Surprisingly, these measures have a sharp reverse toward the end of March. However, the performance of these measures across various sectors is heterogeneous. Financial and healthcare sectors are the most pessimistic and optimistic divisions, respectively.", "published": "2020-04-24 12:25:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11686v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "econ.GN", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Baseline Estimation of Commercial Building HVAC Fan Power Using Tensor Completion", "abstract": "Commercial building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems have been studied for providing ancillary services to power grids via demand response (DR). One critical issue is to estimate the counterfactual baseline power consumption that would have prevailed without DR. Baseline methods have been developed based on whole building electric load profiles. New methods are necessary to estimate the baseline power consumption of HVAC sub-components (e.g., supply and return fans), which have different characteristics compared to that of the whole building. Tensor completion can estimate the unobserved entries of multi-dimensional tensors describing complex data sets. It exploits high-dimensional data to capture granular insights into the problem. This paper proposes to use it for baselining HVAC fan power, by utilizing its capability of capturing dominant fan power patterns. The tensor completion method is evaluated using HVAC fan power data from several buildings at the University of Michigan, and compared with several existing methods. The tensor completion method generally outperforms the benchmarks.", "published": "2020-04-24 23:03:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13557v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
