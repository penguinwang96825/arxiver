{"title": "Competency Tracking for English as a Second or Foreign Language Learners", "abstract": "My system utilizes the outcomes feature found in Moodle and other learning\ncontent management systems (LCMSs) to keep track of where students are in terms\nof what language competencies they have mastered and the competencies they need\nto get where they want to go. These competencies are based on the Common\nEuropean Framework for (English) Language Learning. This data can be available\nfor everyone involved with a given student's progress (e.g. educators, parents,\nsupervisors and the students themselves). A given student's record of past\naccomplishments can also be meshed with those of his classmates. Not only are a\nstudent's competencies easily seen and tracked, educators can view competencies\nof a group of students that were achieved prior to enrollment in the class.\nThis should make curriculum decision making easier and more efficient for\neducators.", "published": "2013-06-26 05:02:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6130v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
