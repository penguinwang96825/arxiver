{"title": "Logique math\u00e9matique et linguistique formelle", "abstract": "As the etymology of the word shows, logic is intimately related to language,\nas exemplified by the work of philosophers from Antiquity and from the\nMiddle-Age. At the beginning of the XX century, the crisis of the foundations\nof mathematics invented mathematical logic and imposed logic as a\nlanguage-based foundation for mathematics. How did the relations between logic\nand language evolved in this newly defined mathematical framework? After a\nsurvey of the history of the relation between logic and linguistics,\ntraditionally focused on semantics, we focus on some present issues: 1) grammar\nas a deductive system 2) the transformation of the syntactic structure of a\nsentence to a logical formula representing its meaning 3) taking into account\nthe context when interpreting words. This lecture shows that type theory\nprovides a convenient framework both for natural language syntax and for the\ninterpretation of any of tis level (words, sentences, discourse).", "published": "2013-11-08 08:24:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1897v1", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
