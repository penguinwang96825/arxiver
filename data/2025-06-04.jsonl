{"title": "Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation", "abstract": "Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute\nefficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update\nfacts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a\n\"precomputation step\", which requires a one-time but significant computational\ncost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million\nhidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million\ntokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single\nGPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this\nprecomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this\nexcessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and\nrelated methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a\nvery small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the\ntheoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for\nsolutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that\nknowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing\nsignificantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the\nprecomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally\nstipulated number of hidden vectors.

{"title": "Does Thinking More always Help?

This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an\nalternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by\nBest-of-N sampling.

While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously\nacquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains\nchallenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high\nsample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL,\non the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper\nintroduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex\nembodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic\nlatent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized\nunsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction,\ndisentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream\nlearning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action\ninterface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream\ntasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing\nmethods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Although human-AI\ncollaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive\nhuman intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper\ndevelops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to\novercome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value\npropagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC)\nframework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions\nC-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal\nhuman interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to\nintegrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that\nmaximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently\nand continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a\npolicy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return\ndistribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and\nself-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This\nensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and\nperformance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios\nreveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of\nsafety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults.

In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents.

This language-centric structure enables the system to detect\nboth explicit and implicit harms with improved interpretability and categorical\ngranularity. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scoring mechanism based on a\ncontextual toxicity risk matrix to quantify harmfulness across different\nsemantic dimensions.

{"title": "DenseDPO: Fine-Grained Temporal Preference Optimization for Video Diffusion Models", "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been applied as a\npost-training technique for text-to-video diffusion models. To obtain training\ndata, annotators are asked to provide preferences between two videos generated\nfrom independent noise. However, this approach prohibits fine-grained\ncomparisons, and we point out that it biases the annotators towards low-motion\nclips as they often contain fewer visual artifacts. In this work, we introduce\nDenseDPO, a method that addresses these shortcomings by making three\ncontributions. First, we create each video pair for DPO by denoising corrupted\ncopies of a ground truth video. This results in aligned pairs with similar\nmotion structures while differing in local details, effectively neutralizing\nthe motion bias. Second, we leverage the resulting temporal alignment to label\npreferences on short segments rather than entire clips, yielding a denser and\nmore precise learning signal. With only one-third of the labeled data, DenseDPO\ngreatly improves motion generation over vanilla DPO, while matching it in text\nalignment, visual quality, and temporal consistency. Finally, we show that\nDenseDPO unlocks automatic preference annotation using off-the-shelf Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs): GPT accurately predicts segment-level preferences\nsimilar to task-specifically fine-tuned video reward models, and DenseDPO\ntrained on these labels achieves performance close to using human labels.", "published": "2025-06-04 03:06:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03517v1", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

Beyond their quantum\napplications, we focus on IrOAs as a combinatorial and coding theory problem.\nAn OA is an IrOA if and only if its minimum Hamming distance is at least $t +\n1$. Using this characterization, we demonstrate that for any linear code,\neither the code itself or its Euclidean dual forms a linear IrOA, giving a huge\nsource of IrOAs. In the special case of self-dual codes, both the code and its\ndual yield IrOAs. Moreover, we construct new families of linear IrOAs based on\nself-dual, Maximum Distance Separable (MDS), and MDS-self-dual codes.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel, scalable graphon estimator that directly\nrecovers the graphon via moment matching, leveraging implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs).

In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision.

First, due to\ncustomer heterogeneity, the seller should set different redemption thresholds\nfor different customers to generate high revenue. Second, the relationship\nbetween customer behavior and the number of accumulated points is typically\nunknown; this requires experimentation which may unfairly devalue customers'\npreviously earned points.

Most partitioned FSI schemes\napply a Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) split of the interface conditions. The DN scheme\nis adequate in a wide range of applications, but it is sensitive to the\nadded-mass effect, and it is susceptible to the incompressibility dilemma, i.e.\nit completely fails for FSI problems with an incompressible fluid furnished\nwith Dirichlet boundary conditions on the part of its boundary complementary to\nthe interface. In this paper, we show that if the fluid is incompressible and\nthe fluid domain is nearly-closed, i.e. it carries Dirichlet conditions except\nfor a permeable part of the boundary carrying a Robin condition, then the DN\npartitioned approach is sensitive to the flow resistance at the permeable part,\nand convergence of the partitioned approach deteriorates as the flow resistance\nincreases. The DN scheme then becomes unstable in the limit as the flow\nresistance passes to infinity. Based on a simple model problem, we show that in\nthe nearly-closed case, the convergence rate of the DN partitioned method\ndepends on a so-called added-damping effect.

Thrombectomy outcomes have been performed for\npatient-specific cases using in silico models. However, until now, in vivo\nfriction coefficients for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel\ninteractions are unknown, but in vitro experiments have been attempted with\nsignificant standard deviations. These interactions and friction coefficients\nhave been considered an important aspect of thrombectomy success. Objectives:\nIn the current study, we explored the influence of variation in friction forces\nfor stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions using virtual\nmechanical thrombectomy (VMT). We have performed three simulations for each\ninteraction and varied friction coefficients around the standard deviation\nobserved in the past in vitro studies. Results: (i) clot-vessel friction:\nhigher friction leads to clot fragmentation and VMT failure. (ii) stent-clot\nfriction: it is susceptible to VMT outcomes, with lower values showing the\nslippage of the clot while higher values lead to fragmentation. (iii)\nstent-vessel friction: higher friction shows compression of the stent in curved\nvessels and dislodgment of clot from stent retriever (SR) due to its\ncompression, which leads to VMT failure. (iv) retrieval speed (RS): higher RS\n(>30 mm/s) leads to significant stent compression and unrealistic behavior of\nthe SR.

This paper\nprovides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for understanding\nwhen and how these methods achieve predictive success. I examine two key\naspects of high-dimensional learning in finance. First, I prove that\nwithin-sample standardization in Random Fourier Features implementations\nfundamentally alters the underlying Gaussian kernel approximation, replacing\nshift-invariant kernels with training-set dependent alternatives. Second, I\nestablish information-theoretic lower bounds that identify when reliable\nlearning is impossible no matter how sophisticated the estimator. A detailed\nquantitative calibration of the polynomial lower bound shows that with typical\nparameter choices, e.g., 12,000 features, 12 monthly observations, and R-square\n2-3%, the required sample size to escape the bound exceeds 25-30 years of\ndata--well beyond any rolling-window actually used. Thus, observed\nout-of-sample success must originate from lower-complexity artefacts rather\nthan from the intended high-dimensional mechanism.", "published": "2025-06-04 09:41:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03780v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG", "econ.EM", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}

{"title": "Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Optimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems", "abstract": "This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem\nin downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where\ndata packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The\nsequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP),\nmaking it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively\nhandle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a\nhybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically,\nproximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase\nshift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions.\nTo further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier\nallocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier\nallocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive\nresource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors\nclosely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in\nbuffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space.\nFurthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training\nefficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource\nallocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness\ncompared to baseline methods.", "published": "2025-06-04 05:33:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.IT", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
