{"title": "Tiered Clustering to Improve Lexical Entailment", "abstract": "Many tasks in Natural Language Processing involve recognizing lexical\nentailment. Two different approaches to this problem have been proposed\nrecently that are quite different from each other. The first is an asymmetric\nsimilarity measure designed to give high scores when the contexts of the\nnarrower term in the entailment are a subset of those of the broader term. The\nsecond is a supervised approach where a classifier is learned to predict\nentailment given a concatenated latent vector representation of the word. Both\nof these approaches are vector space models that use a single context vector as\na representation of the word. In this work, I study the effects of clustering\nwords into senses and using these multiple context vectors to infer entailment\nusing extensions of these two algorithms. I find that this approach offers some\nimprovement to these entailment algorithms.", "published": "2014-12-02 00:53:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0751v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Exemplar Dynamics and Sound Merger in Language", "abstract": "We develop a model of phonological contrast in natural language.\nSpecifically, the model describes the maintenance of contrast between different\nwords in a language, and the elimination of such contrast when sounds in the\nwords merge. An example of such a contrast is that provided by the two vowel\nsounds 'i' and 'e', which distinguish pairs of words such as 'pin' and 'pen' in\nmost dialects of English. We model language users' knowledge of the\npronunciation of a word as consisting of collections of labeled exemplars\nstored in memory. Each exemplar is a detailed memory of a particular utterance\nof the word in question. In our model an exemplar is represented by one or two\nphonetic variables along with a weight indicating how strong the memory of the\nutterance is. Starting from an exemplar-level model we derive\nintegro-differential equations for the evolution of exemplar density fields in\nphonetic space. Using these latter equations we investigate under what\nconditions two sounds merge, thus eliminating the contrast. Our main conclusion\nis that for the preservation of phonological contrast, it is necessary that\nanomalous utterances of a given word are discarded, and not merely stored in\nmemory as an exemplar of another word.", "published": "2014-12-02 22:30:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1841v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.DS", "nlin.AO", "91F20, 70F99"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
