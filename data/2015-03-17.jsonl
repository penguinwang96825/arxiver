{"title": "$gen$CNN: A Convolutional Architecture for Word Sequence Prediction", "abstract": "We propose a novel convolutional architecture, named $gen$CNN, for word\nsequence prediction. Different from previous work on neural network-based\nlanguage modeling and generation (e.g., RNN or LSTM), we choose not to greedily\nsummarize the history of words as a fixed length vector. Instead, we use a\nconvolutional neural network to predict the next word with the history of words\nof variable length. Also different from the existing feedforward networks for\nlanguage modeling, our model can effectively fuse the local correlation and\nglobal correlation in the word sequence, with a convolution-gating strategy\nspecifically designed for the task. We argue that our model can give adequate\nrepresentation of the history, and therefore can naturally exploit both the\nshort and long range dependencies. Our model is fast, easy to train, and\nreadily parallelized. Our extensive experiments on text generation and $n$-best\nre-ranking in machine translation show that $gen$CNN outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts with big margins.", "published": "2015-03-17 13:26:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05034v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Prediction Using Note Text: Synthetic Feature Creation with word2vec", "abstract": "word2vec affords a simple yet powerful approach of extracting quantitative\nvariables from unstructured textual data. Over half of healthcare data is\nunstructured and therefore hard to model without involved expertise in data\nengineering and natural language processing. word2vec can serve as a bridge to\nquickly gather intelligence from such data sources.\n  In this study, we ran 650 megabytes of unstructured, medical chart notes from\nthe Providence Health & Services electronic medical record through word2vec. We\nused two different approaches in creating predictive variables and tested them\non the risk of readmission for patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung\nDisease). As a comparative benchmark, we ran the same test using the LACE risk\nmodel (a single score based on length of stay, acuity, comorbid conditions, and\nemergency department visits).\n  Using only free text and mathematical might, we found word2vec comparable to\nLACE in predicting the risk of readmission of COPD patients.", "published": "2015-03-17 17:04:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05123v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
