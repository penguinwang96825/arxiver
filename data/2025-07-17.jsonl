A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively.

Experiments with\nreal-world GPS data collected in dense urban areas demonstrate that the\nproposed method significantly improves the positioning success rate and the\nreceiver containment rate, even with imperfect LOS/NLOS classification.\nAlthough a slight increase in the position bound was observed due to the\nreduced number of satellites used, overall positioning reliability was\nsubstantially enhanced, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nin urban GNSS environments.", "published": "2025-07-17 00:54:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12706v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry).

{"title": "Joint Motion, Angle, and Range Estimation in Near-Field under Array Calibration Imperfections", "abstract": "Ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output MIMO (UM-MIMO) leverages large\nantenna arrays at high frequencies, transitioning communication paradigm into\nthe radiative near-field (NF), where spherical wavefronts enable full-vector\nestimation of both target location and velocity. However, location and motion\nparameters become inherently coupled in this regime, making their joint\nestimation computationally demanding. To overcome this, we propose a novel\napproach that projects the received two-dimensional space-time signal onto the\nangle-Doppler domain using a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform\n(2D-DFT). Our analysis reveals that the resulting angular spread is centered at\nthe target's true angle, with its width determined by the target's range.\nSimilarly, transverse motion induces a Doppler spread centered at the true\nradial velocity, with the width of Doppler spread proportional to the\ntransverse velocity. Exploiting these spectral characteristics, we develop a\nlow-complexity algorithm that provides coarse estimates of angle, range, and\nvelocity, which are subsequently refined using one-dimensional multiple signal\nclassification (MUSIC) applied independently to each parameter. The proposed\nmethod enables accurate and efficient estimation of NF target motion\nparameters. Simulation results demonstrate a normalized mean squared error\n(NMSE) of -40 dB for location and velocity estimates compared to maximum\nlikelihood estimation, while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "published": "2025-07-17 18:14:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13463v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models", "abstract": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined\nby the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces\nContext Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design\nto encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We\npresent a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its\nfoundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate\nthem into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:\ncontext retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We\nthen explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create\nsophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nmemory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through\nthis systematic analysis of over 1400 research papers, our survey not only\nestablishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical\nresearch gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While\ncurrent models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate\nremarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit\npronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.\nAddressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,\nthis survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers\nadvancing context-aware AI.", "published": "2025-07-17 17:50:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13334v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "AutoPartGen: Autogressive 3D Part Generation and Discovery", "abstract": "We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts\nin an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an\nobject, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate\na corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon\n3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric\nexpressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional\nproperties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.\nSpecifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting\none part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and\nadditional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process\ncontinues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus\ndetermining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can\nbe seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring\nadditional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation\ncapabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,\ndemonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part\ngeneration.", "published": "2025-07-17 17:59:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13346v2", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

We refine heuristics to identify arbitrage transactions\nfrom on-chain data and introduce a robust empirical framework to estimate\narbitrage revenue without knowing traders' actual behaviors on CEX. Leveraging\nan extensive dataset spanning 19 months from August 2023 to March 2025, we\nestimate a total of 233.8M USD extracted by 19 major CEX-DEX searchers from\n7,203,560 identified CEX-DEX arbitrages. Our analysis reveals increasing\ncentralization trends as three searchers captured three-quarters of both volume\nand extracted value. We also demonstrate that searchers' profitability is tied\nto their integration level with block builders and uncover exclusive\nsearcher-builder relationships and their market impact. Finally, we correct the\npreviously underestimated profitability of block builders who vertically\nintegrate with a searcher. These insights illuminate the darkest corner of the\nMEV landscape and highlight the critical implications of CEX-DEX arbitrages for\nEthereum's decentralization.", "published": "2025-07-17 11:50:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13023v2", "categories": ["cs.CR", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}
