{"title": "Unsupervised authorship attribution", "abstract": "We describe a technique for attributing parts of a written text to a set of\nunknown authors. Nothing is assumed to be known a priori about the writing\nstyles of potential authors. We use multiple independent clusterings of an\ninput text to identify parts that are similar and dissimilar to one another. We\ndescribe algorithms necessary to combine the multiple clusterings into a\nmeaningful output. We show results of the application of the technique on texts\nhaving multiple writing styles.", "published": "2015-03-26 04:02:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07613v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Breaking the News: First Impressions Matter on Online News", "abstract": "A growing number of people are changing the way they consume news, replacing\nthe traditional physical newspapers and magazines by their virtual online\nversions or/and weblogs. The interactivity and immediacy present in online news\nare changing the way news are being produced and exposed by media corporations.\nNews websites have to create effective strategies to catch people's attention\nand attract their clicks. In this paper we investigate possible strategies used\nby online news corporations in the design of their news headlines. We analyze\nthe content of 69,907 headlines produced by four major global media\ncorporations during a minimum of eight consecutive months in 2014. In order to\ndiscover strategies that could be used to attract clicks, we extracted features\nfrom the text of the news headlines related to the sentiment polarity of the\nheadline. We discovered that the sentiment of the headline is strongly related\nto the popularity of the news and also with the dynamics of the posted comments\non that particular news.", "published": "2015-03-26 22:20:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07921v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
