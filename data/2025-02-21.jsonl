{"title": "Network topology of the Euro Area interbank market", "abstract": "The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial\ndata, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the\nneed of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful\ninformation from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network\napproach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct\nlayers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial\nrelationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data\ncollections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze\nand compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives,\neventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This\ngranular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and\npractitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to\nsupport financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more\nholistic point of view.", "published": "2025-02-21 17:31:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15611v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.CE", "stat.CO", "91B70, 05C82, 62P20, 91G80", "G.3; I.5.3; I.6.5; J.4"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets", "abstract": "Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless\neconomic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and\napplied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution,\nbased on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in\nDiebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using\nfull orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran,\nand Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special\nand extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In\nparticular, we allow network nodes to be connected in \"clusters\", such as asset\nclasses, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters\n(Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters\n(Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the\nordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within\nclusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it\nin a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning\nthree global regions.", "published": "2025-02-21 13:33:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458v1", "categories": ["econ.EM", "q-fin.ST", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "econ.EM"}
{"title": "Multi-Agent Stock Prediction Systems: Machine Learning Models, Simulations, and Real-Time Trading Strategies", "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on stock price prediction,\nleveragingadvanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to\nimprove financial forecasting accuracy. The research evaluates the performance\nof various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and\nattention-based models. These models are assessed for their ability to capture\ncomplex temporal dependencies inherent in stock market data. Our findings show\nthat attention-based models outperform other architectures, achieving the\nhighest accuracy by capturing both short and long-term dependencies. This study\ncontributes valuable insights into AI-driven financial forecasting, offering\npractical guidance for developing more accurate and efficient trading systems.", "published": "2025-02-21 06:36:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15853v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
