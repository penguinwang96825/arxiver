{"title": "Exploring subgraph complementation to bounded degree graphs", "abstract": "Graph modification problems are computational tasks where the goal is to\nchange an input graph $G$ using operations from a fixed set, in order to make\nthe resulting graph satisfy a target property, which usually entails membership\nto a desired graph class $\\mathcal{C}$. Some well-known examples of operations\ninclude vertex-deletion, edge-deletion, edge-addition and edge-contraction. In\nthis paper we address an operation known as subgraph complement. Given a graph\n$G$ and a subset $S$ of its vertices, the subgraph complement $G \\oplus S$ is\nthe graph resulting of complementing the edge set of the subgraph induced by\n$S$ in $G$. We say that a graph $H$ is a subgraph complement of $G$ if there is\nan $S$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to $G \\oplus S$. For a graph class\n$\\mathcal{C}$, subgraph complementation to $\\mathcal{C}$ is the problem of\ndeciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ has a subgraph complement in\n$\\mathcal{C}$. This problem has been studied and its complexity has been\nsettled for many classes $\\mathcal{C}$ such as $\\mathcal{H}$-free graphs, for\nvarious families $\\mathcal{H}$, and for classes of bounded degeneracy. In this\nwork, we focus on classes graphs of minimum/maximum degree upper/lower bounded\nby some value $k$. In particular, we answer an open question of Antony et al.\n[Information Processing Letters 188, 106530 (2025)], by showing that subgraph\ncomplementation to $\\mathcal{C}$ is NP-complete when $\\mathcal{C}$ is the class\nof graphs of minimum degree at least $k$, if $k$ is part of the input. We also\nshow that subgraph complementation to $k$-regular parameterized by $k$ is\nfixed-parameter tractable.", "published": "2025-02-21 18:57:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15675v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "05C07, 05C76, 05C85"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "List Decoding Quotient Reed-Muller Codes", "abstract": "Reed-Muller codes consist of evaluations of $n$-variate polynomials over a\nfinite field $\\mathbb{F}$ with degree at most $d$. Much like every linear code,\nReed-Muller codes can be characterized by constraints, where a codeword is\nvalid if and only if it satisfies all \\emph{degree-$d$} constraints.\n  For a subset $\\tilde{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^n$, we introduce the notion of\n\\emph{$\\tilde{X}$-quotient} Reed-Muller code. A function $F : \\tilde{X}\n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}$ is a valid codeword in the quotient code if it\nsatisfies all the constraints of degree-$d$ polynomials \\emph{lying in\n$\\tilde{X}$}. This gives rise to a novel phenomenon: a quotient codeword may\nhave \\emph{many} extensions to original codewords. This weakens the connection\nbetween original codewords and quotient codewords which introduces a richer\nrange of behaviors along with substantial new challenges.\n  Our goal is to answer the following question: what properties of $\\tilde{X}$\nwill imply that the quotient code inherits its distance and list-decoding\nradius from the original code? We address this question using techniques\ndeveloped by Bhowmick and Lovett [BL14], identifying key properties of\n$\\mathbb{F}^n$ used in their proof and extending them to general subsets\n$\\tilde{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^n$. By introducing a new tool, we overcome the\nnovel challenge in analyzing the quotient code that arises from the weak\nconnection between original and quotient codewords. This enables us to apply\nknown results from additive combinatorics and algebraic geometry [KZ18, KZ19,\nLZ21] to show that when $\\tilde{X}$ is a \\emph{high rank variety},\n$\\tilde{X}$-quotient Reed-Muller codes inherit the distance and list-decoding\nparameters from the original Reed-Muller codes.", "published": "2025-02-21 18:19:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15650v1", "categories": ["cs.CC", "cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.CC"}

{"title": "Approximate weighted 3-coloring", "abstract": "The paper considers the NP-hard graph vertex coloring problem, which differs\nfrom traditional problems in which it is required to color vertices with a\ngiven (or minimal) number of colors so that adjacent vertices have different\ncolors. In the problem under consideration, a simple edge-weighted graph is\ngiven. It is required to color its vertices in 3 colors to minimize the total\nweight of monochromatic (one-color) edges, i.e. edges with the same colors of\ntheir end vertices. This problem is poorly investigated. Previously, we\ndeveloped graph decomposition algorithms that, in particular, allowed us to\nconstruct lower bounds for the optimum, as well as several greedy algorithms.\nIn this paper, several new approximation algorithms are proposed. Among them\nare variable neighborhood search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and\ngraph clustering with further finding the optimal coloring in each cluster. A\nnumerical experiment was conducted on random graphs, as well as on real\ncommunication graphs. The characteristics of the algorithms are presented both\nin tables and graphically.

In recent decades, a large literature has developed and\napplied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution,\nbased on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in\nDiebold and Yilmaz (2014).

In\nparticular, we allow network nodes to be connected in \"clusters\", such as asset\nclasses, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters\n(Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters\n(Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the\nordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within\nclusters.
