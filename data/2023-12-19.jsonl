{"title": "How to apply tree decomposition ideas in large networks?", "abstract": "Graph decompositions are the natural generalisation of tree decompositions where the decomposition tree is replaced by a genuine graph. Recently they found theoretical applications in the theory of sparsity, topological graph theory, structural graph theory and geometric group theory.\n  We demonstrate applicability of graph decompositions on large networks by implementing an efficient algorithm and testing it on road networks.", "published": "2023-12-19 17:37:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12354v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
