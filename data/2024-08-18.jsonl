{"title": "A new measure of risk using Fourier analysis", "abstract": "We use Fourier analysis to access risk in financial products. With it we\nanalyze price changes of e.g. stocks. Via Fourier analysis we scrutinize\nquantitatively whether the frequency of change is higher than a change in\n(conserved) company value would allow. If it is the case, it would be a clear\nindicator of speculation and with it risk. The entire methods or better its\napplication is fairly new. However, there were severe flaws in previous\nattempts; making the results (not the method) doubtful. We corrected all these\nmistakes by e.g. using Fourier transformation instead of discrete Fourier\nanalysis. Our analysis is reliable in the entire frequency band, even for\nfre-quency of 1/1d or higher if the prices are noted accordingly. For the\nstocks scrutinized we found that the price of stocks changes disproportionally\nwithin one week which clearly indicates spec-ulation. It would be an\ninteresting extension to apply the method to crypto currencies as these\ncurrencies have no conserved value which makes normal considerations of\nvolatility difficult.", "published": "2024-08-18 11:55:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10279v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "91B05, 62P20", "G.m; G.3"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Crisis Alpha: A High-Performance Trading Algorithm Tested in Market Downturns", "abstract": "Forming quantitative portfolios using statistical risk models presents a\nsignificant challenge for hedge funds and portfolio managers. This research\ninvestigates three distinct statistical risk models to construct quantitative\nportfolios of 1,000 floating stocks in the US market. Utilizing five different\ninvestment strategies, these models are tested across four periods,\nencompassing the last three major financial crises: The Dot Com Bubble, Global\nFinancial Crisis, and Covid-19 market downturn. Backtests leverage the CRSP\ndataset from January 1990 through December 2023. The results demonstrate that\nthe proposed models consistently outperformed market excess returns across all\nperiods. These findings suggest that the developed risk models can serve as\nvaluable tools for asset managers, aiding in strategic decision-making and risk\nmanagement in various economic conditions.", "published": "2024-08-18 19:35:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14510v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
