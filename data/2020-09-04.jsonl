{"title": "What the Future Brings: Investigating the Impact of Lookahead for Incremental Neural TTS", "abstract": "In incremental text to speech synthesis (iTTS), the synthesizer produces an audio output before it has access to the entire input sentence. In this paper, we study the behavior of a neural sequence-to-sequence TTS system when used in an incremental mode, i.e. when generating speech output for token n, the system has access to n + k tokens from the text sequence. We first analyze the impact of this incremental policy on the evolution of the encoder representations of token n for different values of k (the lookahead parameter). The results show that, on average, tokens travel 88% of the way to their full context representation with a one-word lookahead and 94% after 2 words. We then investigate which text features are the most influential on the evolution towards the final representation using a random forest analysis. The results show that the most salient factors are related to token length. We finally evaluate the effects of lookahead k at the decoder level, using a MUSHRA listening test. This test shows results that contrast with the above high figures: speech synthesis quality obtained with 2 word-lookahead is significantly lower than the one obtained with the full sentence.", "published": "2020-09-04 07:30:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02035v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "A General Framework for Fairness in Multistakeholder Recommendations", "abstract": "Contemporary recommender systems act as intermediaries on multi-sided platforms serving high utility recommendations from sellers to buyers. Such systems attempt to balance the objectives of multiple stakeholders including sellers, buyers, and the platform itself. The difficulty in providing recommendations that maximize the utility for a buyer, while simultaneously representing all the sellers on the platform has lead to many interesting research problems.Traditionally, they have been formulated as integer linear programs which compute recommendations for all the buyers together in an \\emph{offline} fashion, by incorporating coverage constraints so that the individual sellers are proportionally represented across all the recommended items. Such approaches can lead to unforeseen biases wherein certain buyers consistently receive low utility recommendations in order to meet the global seller coverage constraints. To remedy this situation, we propose a general formulation that incorporates seller coverage objectives alongside individual buyer objectives in a real-time personalized recommender system. In addition, we leverage highly scalable submodular optimization algorithms to provide recommendations to each buyer with provable theoretical quality bounds. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate the efficacy of our approach using data from an online real-estate marketplace.", "published": "2020-09-04 23:54:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02423v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Technical Report: The Policy Graph Improvement Algorithm", "abstract": "Optimizing a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) policy is challenging. The policy graph improvement (PGI) algorithm for POMDPs represents the policy as a fixed size policy graph and improves the policy monotonically. Due to the fixed policy size, computation time for each improvement iteration is known in advance. Moreover, the method allows for compact understandable policies. This report describes the technical details of the PGI [1] and particle based PGI [2] algorithms for POMDPs in a more accessible way than [1] or [2] allowing practitioners and students to understand and implement the algorithms.", "published": "2020-09-04 13:00:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02164v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Hybrid DCOP Solvers: Boosting Performance of Local Search Algorithms", "abstract": "We propose a novel method for expediting both symmetric and asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) solvers. The core idea is based on initializing DCOP solvers with greedy fast non-iterative DCOP solvers. This is contrary to existing methods where initialization is always achieved using a random value assignment. We empirically show that changing the starting conditions of existing DCOP solvers not only reduces the algorithm convergence time by up to 50\\%, but also reduces the communication overhead and leads to a better solution quality. We show that this effect is due to structural improvements in the variable assignment, which is caused by the spreading pattern of DCOP algorithm activation.) /Subject (Hybrid DCOPs)", "published": "2020-09-04 15:17:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02240v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.DC"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Simultaneous Preference and Metric Learning from Paired Comparisons", "abstract": "A popular model of preference in the context of recommendation systems is the so-called \\emph{ideal point} model. In this model, a user is represented as a vector $\\mathbf{u}$ together with a collection of items $\\mathbf{x_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x_N}$ in a common low-dimensional space. The vector $\\mathbf{u}$ represents the user's \"ideal point,\" or the ideal combination of features that represents a hypothesized most preferred item. The underlying assumption in this model is that a smaller distance between $\\mathbf{u}$ and an item $\\mathbf{x_j}$ indicates a stronger preference for $\\mathbf{x_j}$. In the vast majority of the existing work on learning ideal point models, the underlying distance has been assumed to be Euclidean. However, this eliminates any possibility of interactions between features and a user's underlying preferences. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning an ideal point representation of a user's preferences when the distance metric is an unknown Mahalanobis metric. Specifically, we present a novel approach to estimate the user's ideal point $\\mathbf{u}$ and the Mahalanobis metric from paired comparisons of the form \"item $\\mathbf{x_i}$ is preferred to item $\\mathbf{x_j}$.\" This can be viewed as a special case of a more general metric learning problem where the location of some points are unknown a priori. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to exhibit the effectiveness of our algorithm.", "published": "2020-09-04 16:59:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02302v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "SEANet: A Multi-modal Speech Enhancement Network", "abstract": "We explore the possibility of leveraging accelerometer data to perform speech enhancement in very noisy conditions. Although it is possible to only partially reconstruct user's speech from the accelerometer, the latter provides a strong conditioning signal that is not influenced from noise sources in the environment. Based on this observation, we feed a multi-modal input to SEANet (Sound EnhAncement Network), a wave-to-wave fully convolutional model, which adopts a combination of feature losses and adversarial losses to reconstruct an enhanced version of user's speech. We trained our model with data collected by sensors mounted on an earbud and synthetically corrupted by adding different kinds of noise sources to the audio signal. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve very high quality results, even in the case of interfering speech at the same level of loudness. A sample of the output produced by our model is available at https://google-research.github.io/seanet/multimodal/speech.", "published": "2020-09-04 10:22:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02095v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
