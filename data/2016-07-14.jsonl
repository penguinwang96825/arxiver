{"title": "Neural Semantic Encoders", "abstract": "We present a memory augmented neural network for natural language\nunderstanding: Neural Semantic Encoders. NSE is equipped with a novel memory\nupdate rule and has a variable sized encoding memory that evolves over time and\nmaintains the understanding of input sequences through read}, compose and write\noperations. NSE can also access multiple and shared memories. In this paper, we\ndemonstrated the effectiveness and the flexibility of NSE on five different\nnatural language tasks: natural language inference, question answering,\nsentence classification, document sentiment analysis and machine translation\nwhere NSE achieved state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on publically\navailable benchmarks. For example, our shared-memory model showed an\nencouraging result on neural machine translation, improving an attention-based\nbaseline by approximately 1.0 BLEU.", "published": "2016-07-14 20:58:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04315v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
