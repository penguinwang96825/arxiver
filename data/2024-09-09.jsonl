{"title": "Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces", "abstract": "Conformal field theories with central charge $c\\le1$ on random surfaces have\nbeen extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from\ntheir equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by\nthe conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social\nnetworks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the\nsurface area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces\nshrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops\ntheir growth. Two different equilibrium states are distinguished, dominated by\n(i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time\nvariations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have\ngeneralized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails\nwith a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order\nparameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.", "published": "2024-09-09 12:12:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05547v2", "categories": ["hep-th", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "hep-th"}
