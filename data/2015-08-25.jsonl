{"title": "Visualizing NLP annotations for Crowdsourcing", "abstract": "Visualizing NLP annotation is useful for the collection of training data for\nthe statistical NLP approaches. Existing toolkits either provide limited visual\naid, or introduce comprehensive operators to realize sophisticated linguistic\nrules. Workers must be well trained to use them. Their audience thus can hardly\nbe scaled to large amounts of non-expert crowdsourced workers. In this paper,\nwe present CROWDANNO, a visualization toolkit to allow crowd-sourced workers to\nannotate two general categories of NLP problems: clustering and parsing.\nWorkers can finish the tasks with simplified operators in an interactive\ninterface, and fix errors conveniently. User studies show our toolkit is very\nfriendly to NLP non-experts, and allow them to produce high quality labels for\nseveral sophisticated problems. We release our source code and toolkit to spur\nfuture research.", "published": "2015-08-25 06:34:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06044v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Better Summarization Evaluation with Word Embeddings for ROUGE", "abstract": "ROUGE is a widely adopted, automatic evaluation measure for text\nsummarization. While it has been shown to correlate well with human judgements,\nit is biased towards surface lexical similarities. This makes it unsuitable for\nthe evaluation of abstractive summarization, or summaries with substantial\nparaphrasing. We study the effectiveness of word embeddings to overcome this\ndisadvantage of ROUGE. Specifically, instead of measuring lexical overlaps,\nword embeddings are used to compute the semantic similarity of the words used\nin summaries instead. Our experimental results show that our proposal is able\nto achieve better correlations with human judgements when measured with the\nSpearman and Kendall rank coefficients.", "published": "2015-08-25 05:04:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06034v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Robot Language Learning, Generation, and Comprehension", "abstract": "We present a unified framework which supports grounding natural-language\nsemantics in robotic driving. This framework supports acquisition (learning\ngrounded meanings of nouns and prepositions from human annotation of robotic\ndriving paths), generation (using such acquired meanings to generate sentential\ndescription of new robotic driving paths), and comprehension (using such\nacquired meanings to support automated driving to accomplish navigational goals\nspecified in natural language). We evaluate the performance of these three\ntasks by having independent human judges rate the semantic fidelity of the\nsentences associated with paths, achieving overall average correctness of 94.6%\nand overall average completeness of 85.6%.", "published": "2015-08-25 14:10:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06161v1", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
