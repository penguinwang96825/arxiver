{"title": "Analyzer and generator for Pali", "abstract": "This work describes a system that performs morphological analysis and\ngeneration of Pali words. The system works with regular inflectional paradigms\nand a lexical database. The generator is used to build a collection of\ninflected and derived words, which in turn is used by the analyzer. Generating\nand storing morphological forms along with the corresponding morphological\ninformation allows for efficient and simple look up by the analyzer. Indeed, by\nlooking up a word and extracting the attached morphological information, the\nanalyzer does not have to compute this information. As we must, however, assume\nthe lexical database to be incomplete, the system can also work without the\ndictionary component, using a rule-based approach.", "published": "2015-10-06 13:33:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01570v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Language Segmentation", "abstract": "Language segmentation consists in finding the boundaries where one language\nends and another language begins in a text written in more than one language.\nThis is important for all natural language processing tasks. The problem can be\nsolved by training language models on language data. However, in the case of\nlow- or no-resource languages, this is problematic. I therefore investigate\nwhether unsupervised methods perform better than supervised methods when it is\ndifficult or impossible to train supervised approaches. A special focus is\ngiven to difficult texts, i.e. texts that are rather short (one sentence),\ncontaining abbreviations, low-resource languages and non-standard language. I\ncompare three approaches: supervised n-gram language models, unsupervised\nclustering and weakly supervised n-gram language model induction. I devised the\nweakly supervised approach in order to deal with difficult text specifically.\nIn order to test the approach, I compiled a small corpus of different text\ntypes, ranging from one-sentence texts to texts of about 300 words. The weakly\nsupervised language model induction approach works well on short and difficult\ntexts, outperforming the clustering algorithm and reaching scores in the\nvicinity of the supervised approach. The results look promising, but there is\nroom for improvement and a more thorough investigation should be undertaken.", "published": "2015-10-06 19:35:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01717v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "SentiCap: Generating Image Descriptions with Sentiments", "abstract": "The recent progress on image recognition and language modeling is making\nautomatic description of image content a reality. However, stylized,\nnon-factual aspects of the written description are missing from the current\nsystems. One such style is descriptions with emotions, which is commonplace in\neveryday communication, and influences decision-making and interpersonal\nrelationships. We design a system to describe an image with emotions, and\npresent a model that automatically generates captions with positive or negative\nsentiments. We propose a novel switching recurrent neural network with\nword-level regularization, which is able to produce emotional image captions\nusing only 2000+ training sentences containing sentiments. We evaluate the\ncaptions with different automatic and crowd-sourcing metrics. Our model\ncompares favourably in common quality metrics for image captioning. In 84.6% of\ncases the generated positive captions were judged as being at least as\ndescriptive as the factual captions. Of these positive captions 88% were\nconfirmed by the crowd-sourced workers as having the appropriate sentiment.", "published": "2015-10-06 04:57:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01431v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "I.2.10; I.2.7; I.2.6"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Parameterized Neural Network Language Models for Information Retrieval", "abstract": "Information Retrieval (IR) models need to deal with two difficult issues,\nvocabulary mismatch and term dependencies. Vocabulary mismatch corresponds to\nthe difficulty of retrieving relevant documents that do not contain exact query\nterms but semantically related terms. Term dependencies refers to the need of\nconsidering the relationship between the words of the query when estimating the\nrelevance of a document. A multitude of solutions has been proposed to solve\neach of these two problems, but no principled model solve both. In parallel, in\nthe last few years, language models based on neural networks have been used to\ncope with complex natural language processing tasks like emotion and paraphrase\ndetection. Although they present good abilities to cope with both term\ndependencies and vocabulary mismatch problems, thanks to the distributed\nrepresentation of words they are based upon, such models could not be used\nreadily in IR, where the estimation of one language model per document (or\nquery) is required. This is both computationally unfeasible and prone to\nover-fitting. Based on a recent work that proposed to learn a generic language\nmodel that can be modified through a set of document-specific parameters, we\nexplore use of new neural network models that are adapted to ad-hoc IR tasks.\nWithin the language model IR framework, we propose and study the use of a\ngeneric language model as well as a document-specific language model. Both can\nbe used as a smoothing component, but the latter is more adapted to the\ndocument at hand and has the potential of being used as a full document\nlanguage model. We experiment with such models and analyze their results on\nTREC-1 to 8 datasets.", "published": "2015-10-06 13:07:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01562v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "H.3.3; I.2.6"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
