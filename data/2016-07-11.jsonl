{"title": "The Benefits of Word Embeddings Features for Active Learning in Clinical\n  Information Extraction", "abstract": "This study investigates the use of unsupervised word embeddings and sequence\nfeatures for sample representation in an active learning framework built to\nextract clinical concepts from clinical free text. The objective is to further\nreduce the manual annotation effort while achieving higher effectiveness\ncompared to a set of baseline features. Unsupervised features are derived from\nskip-gram word embeddings and a sequence representation approach. The\ncomparative performance of unsupervised features and baseline hand-crafted\nfeatures in an active learning framework are investigated using a wide range of\nselection criteria including least confidence, information diversity,\ninformation density and diversity, and domain knowledge informativeness. Two\nclinical datasets are used for evaluation: the i2b2/VA 2010 NLP challenge and\nthe ShARe/CLEF 2013 eHealth Evaluation Lab. Our results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in terms of effectiveness as well as annotation effort savings\nacross both datasets. Using unsupervised features along with baseline features\nfor sample representation lead to further savings of up to 9% and 10% of the\ntoken and concept annotation rates, respectively.", "published": "2016-07-11 02:46:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02810v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68U15, 68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Exploring the Political Agenda of the European Parliament Using a\n  Dynamic Topic Modeling Approach", "abstract": "This study analyzes the political agenda of the European Parliament (EP)\nplenary, how it has evolved over time, and the manner in which Members of the\nEuropean Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal stimuli when\nmaking plenary speeches. To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes\nin legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new\ndynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English\nlanguage legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our\nfindings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing\ndynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche\ntopics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods.\nSubstantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves\nsignificantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty\nreferenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis. MEP contributions to the\nplenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon by voting behaviour and the\ncommittee structure of the Parliament.", "published": "2016-07-11 17:48:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03055v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Mapping distributional to model-theoretic semantic spaces: a baseline", "abstract": "Word embeddings have been shown to be useful across state-of-the-art systems\nin many natural language processing tasks, ranging from question answering\nsystems to dependency parsing. (Herbelot and Vecchi, 2015) explored word\nembeddings and their utility for modeling language semantics. In particular,\nthey presented an approach to automatically map a standard distributional\nsemantic space onto a set-theoretic model using partial least squares\nregression. We show in this paper that a simple baseline achieves a +51%\nrelative improvement compared to their model on one of the two datasets they\nused, and yields competitive results on the second dataset.", "published": "2016-07-11 01:20:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02802v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
