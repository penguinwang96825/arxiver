{"title": "Probabilistic Topic and Syntax Modeling with Part-of-Speech LDA", "abstract": "This article presents a probabilistic generative model for text based on\nsemantic topics and syntactic classes called Part-of-Speech LDA (POSLDA).\nPOSLDA simultaneously uncovers short-range syntactic patterns (syntax) and\nlong-range semantic patterns (topics) that exist in document collections. This\nresults in word distributions that are specific to both topics (sports,\neducation, ...) and parts-of-speech (nouns, verbs, ...). For example,\nmultinomial distributions over words are uncovered that can be understood as\n\"nouns about weather\" or \"verbs about law\". We describe the model and an\napproximate inference algorithm and then demonstrate the quality of the learned\ntopics both qualitatively and quantitatively. Then, we discuss an NLP\napplication where the output of POSLDA can lead to strong improvements in\nquality: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging. We describe algorithms for this\ntask that make use of POSLDA-learned distributions that result in improved\nperformance beyond the state of the art.", "published": "2013-03-12 10:20:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2826v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Type-theoretical natural language semantics: on the system F for meaning\n  assembly", "abstract": "This paper presents and extends our type theoretical framework for a\ncompositional treatment of natural language semantics with some lexical\nfeatures like coercions (e.g. of a town into a football club) and copredication\n(e.g. on a town as a set of people and as a location). The second order typed\nlambda calculus was shown to be a good framework, and here we discuss how to\nintroduced predefined types and coercive subtyping which are much more natural\nthan internally coded similar constructs. Linguistic applications of these new\nfeatures are also exemplified.", "published": "2013-03-12 21:06:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3036v1", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.CL", "math.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.LO"}
