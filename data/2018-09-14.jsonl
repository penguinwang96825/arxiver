{"title": "Reconfiguration of graphs with connectivity constraints", "abstract": "A graph $G$ realizes the degree sequence $S$ if the degrees of its vertices is $S$. Hakimi gave a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that there exists a connected multigraph realizing $S$. Taylor later proved that any connected multigraph can be transformed into any other via a sequence of flips (maintaining connectivity at any step). A flip consists in replacing two edges $ab$ and $cd$ by the diagonals $ac$ and $bd$. In this paper, we study a generalization of this problem. A set of subsets of vertices $\\mathcal{CC}$ is \\emph{nested} if for every $C,C' \\in \\mathcal{CC}$ either $C \\cap C' = \\emptyset$ or one is included in the other. We are interested in multigraphs realizing a degree sequence $S$ and such that all the sets of a nested collection $\\mathcal{CC}$ induce connected subgraphs. Such constraints naturally appear in tandem mass spectrometry.\n  We show that it is possible to decide in polynomial if there exists a graph realizing $S$ where all the sets in $\\mathcal{CC}$ induce connected subgraphs. Moreover, we prove that all such graphs can be obtained via a sequence of flips such that all the intermediate graphs also realize $S$ and where all the sets of $\\mathcal{CC}$ induce connected subgraphs. Our proof is algorithmic and provides a polynomial time approximation algorithm on the shortest sequence of flips between two graphs whose ratio depends on the depth of the nested partition.", "published": "2018-09-14 14:38:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05443v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CC", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
