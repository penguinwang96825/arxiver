Consequently, thinking after\nreceiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction,\nwhere real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting\nthat humans naturally \"think while listening.\" In this paper, we propose\nSHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken\nchain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams\nthe input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received,\ngenerates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while\nthe user continues speaking.

ZeroPrint\novercomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input\nperturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows\nZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint.\nExperiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a\nstate-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming\nexisting black-box methods.", "published": "2025-10-08 03:27:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06605v1", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}

Recent\nresearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform\ntitle-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student.\nWhile LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid\nReviews, which try to expedite the review process.

The tool accepts a CSV file\ncontaining paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev\nsupports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual\nscreening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human\nreviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool.

Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains.

{"title": "A Broader View of Thompson Sampling", "abstract": "Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit\nalgorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid\ntheoretical guarantees.

In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly\ncrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which\nleads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,\nThompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the\nstructure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by\na measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation.

{"title": "Is the Hard-Label Cryptanalytic Model Extraction Really Polynomial?", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their\ninternal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting\nthese internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to\nextracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,\ncryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been\nactively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely\ndeployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)\nassume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent\nworks (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,\nwhere only the final classification result (e.g., \"dog\" or \"car\") is available\nto the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that\nmodel extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted\nsetting.\n  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack\nbecome increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,\nsatisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with\nrespect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in\npolynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack\nmethod called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret\nparameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs\nexponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this\ninformation from deeper layers.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has\nsimplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with\nrule-based verifiers.

As a result,\nlonger responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute\ndisproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr.\nGRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain\nheuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token\npreferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to\nlearn its own token preference during optimization.

We therefore consider group and\nindividual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level\ndefinitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we\nprovide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral\ndomain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an\noptimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from\nstationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many\nexisting ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of\ngraph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly\nencourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus\nmore flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding\na conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our\nanalysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.\nWe evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate\nits effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of\nFairSpecTemp.", "published": "2025-10-08 20:51:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07536v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Reconfiguring Radio Environments", "abstract": "Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) technology holds immense potential for\nincreasing the spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of wireless networks.\nIn contrast to traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), an\nFIM consists of an array of elements, each capable of independently tuning\nelectromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position along the\ndirection perpendicular to the surface. In contrast to traditional rigid\nmetasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better\nchannel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication\nsystems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize\nthe FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel\ngain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM\nsurface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem\ninto multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD)\nmethod for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain. In\nthe MISO scenario, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, the FIM\nsurface shape, and the phase shift matrix to maximize the channel gain. To\ntackle this complex problem with multiple highly coupled variables, an\nefficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to\ntraditional RIS and exhibits good adaptability to multipath channels.", "published": "2025-10-08 19:15:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07466v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
