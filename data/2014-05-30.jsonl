{"title": "Comparing and Combining Sentiment Analysis Methods", "abstract": "Several messages express opinions about events, products, and services,\npolitical views or even their author's emotional state and mood. Sentiment\nanalysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the\nrepercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products\nand services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication\nin Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring\nsentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning\nmethods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear\nwhich method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or\nnegative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of\ncomparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for\nunderstanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of\npopular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at\nfilling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis\nmethods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is\nidentified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are\nin tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing\napproaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement. We\nalso present a free Web service called iFeel, which provides an open API for\naccessing and comparing results across different sentiment methods for a given\ntext.", "published": "2014-05-30 22:47:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0032v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Semantic Composition and Decomposition: From Recognition to Generation", "abstract": "Semantic composition is the task of understanding the meaning of text by\ncomposing the meanings of the individual words in the text. Semantic\ndecomposition is the task of understanding the meaning of an individual word by\ndecomposing it into various aspects (factors, constituents, components) that\nare latent in the meaning of the word. We take a distributional approach to\nsemantics, in which a word is represented by a context vector. Much recent work\nhas considered the problem of recognizing compositions and decompositions, but\nwe tackle the more difficult generation problem. For simplicity, we focus on\nnoun-modifier bigrams and noun unigrams. A test for semantic composition is,\ngiven context vectors for the noun and modifier in a noun-modifier bigram (\"red\nsalmon\"), generate a noun unigram that is synonymous with the given bigram\n(\"sockeye\"). A test for semantic decomposition is, given a context vector for a\nnoun unigram (\"snifter\"), generate a noun-modifier bigram that is synonymous\nwith the given unigram (\"brandy glass\"). With a vocabulary of about 73,000\nunigrams from WordNet, there are 73,000 candidate unigram compositions for a\nbigram and 5,300,000,000 (73,000 squared) candidate bigram decompositions for a\nunigram. We generate ranked lists of potential solutions in two passes. A fast\nunsupervised learning algorithm generates an initial list of candidates and\nthen a slower supervised learning algorithm refines the list. We evaluate the\ncandidate solutions by comparing them to WordNet synonym sets. For\ndecomposition (unigram to bigram), the top 100 most highly ranked bigrams\ninclude a WordNet synonym of the given unigram 50.7% of the time. For\ncomposition (bigram to unigram), the top 100 most highly ranked unigrams\ninclude a WordNet synonym of the given bigram 77.8% of the time.", "published": "2014-05-30 16:36:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7908v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "H.3.1; I.2.6; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
