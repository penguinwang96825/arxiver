{"title": "DepecheMood: a Lexicon for Emotion Analysis from Crowd-Annotated News", "abstract": "While many lexica annotated with words polarity are available for sentiment\nanalysis, very few tackle the harder task of emotion analysis and are usually\nquite limited in coverage. In this paper, we present a novel approach for\nextracting - in a totally automated way - a high-coverage and high-precision\nlexicon of roughly 37 thousand terms annotated with emotion scores, called\nDepecheMood. Our approach exploits in an original way 'crowd-sourced' affective\nannotation implicitly provided by readers of news articles from rappler.com. By\nproviding new state-of-the-art performances in unsupervised settings for\nregression and classification tasks, even using a na\\\"{\\i}ve approach, our\nexperiments show the beneficial impact of harvesting social media data for\naffective lexicon building.", "published": "2014-05-07 13:40:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1605v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Alternative Name Spellings", "abstract": "Name matching is a key component of systems for entity resolution or record\nlinkage. Alternative spellings of the same names are a com- mon occurrence in\nmany applications. We use the largest collection of genealogy person records in\nthe world together with user search query logs to build name matching models.\nThe procedure for building a crowd-sourced training set is outlined together\nwith the presentation of our method. We cast the problem of learning\nalternative spellings as a machine translation problem at the character level.\nWe use in- formation retrieval evaluation methodology to show that this method\nsubstantially outperforms on our data a number of standard well known phonetic\nand string similarity methods in terms of precision and re- call. Additionally,\nwe rigorously compare the performance of standard methods when compared with\neach other. Our result can lead to a significant practical impact in entity\nresolution applications.", "published": "2014-05-07 19:47:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2048v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
