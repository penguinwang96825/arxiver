{"title": "Auto Spell Suggestion for High Quality Speech Synthesis in Hindi", "abstract": "The goal of Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis in a particular language is to\nconvert arbitrary input text to intelligible and natural sounding speech.\nHowever, for a particular language like Hindi, which is a highly confusing\nlanguage (due to very close spellings), it is not an easy task to identify\nerrors/mistakes in input text and an incorrect text degrade the quality of\noutput speech hence this paper is a contribution to the development of high\nquality speech synthesis with the involvement of Spellchecker which generates\nspell suggestions for misspelled words automatically. Involvement of\nspellchecker would increase the efficiency of speech synthesis by providing\nspell suggestions for incorrect input text. Furthermore, we have provided the\ncomparative study for evaluating the resultant effect on to phonetic text by\nadding spellchecker on to input text.", "published": "2014-02-15 05:11:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3648v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

The learning models behind the\nsoftware are described in two research papers. We found the description of the\nmodels in these papers to be somewhat cryptic and hard to follow.
