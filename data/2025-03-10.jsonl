{"title": "Incentive-Compatible Recovery from Manipulated Signals, with Applications to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure", "abstract": "We introduce the first formal model capturing the elicitation of unverifiable\ninformation from a party (the \"source\") with implicit signals derived by other\nplayers (the \"observers\"). Our model is motivated in part by applications in\ndecentralized physical infrastructure networks (a.k.a. \"DePIN\"), an emerging\napplication domain in which physical services (e.g., sensor information,\nbandwidth, or energy) are provided at least in part by untrusted and\nself-interested parties. A key challenge in these signal network applications\nis verifying the level of service that was actually provided by network\nparticipants.\n  We first establish a condition called source identifiability, which we show\nis necessary for the existence of a mechanism for which truthful signal\nreporting is a strict equilibrium. For a converse, we build on techniques from\npeer prediction to show that in every signal network that satisfies the source\nidentifiability condition, there is in fact a strictly truthful mechanism,\nwhere truthful signal reporting gives strictly higher total expected payoff\nthan any less informative equilibrium. We furthermore show that this truthful\nequilibrium is in fact the unique equilibrium of the mechanism if there is\npositive probability that any one observer is unconditionally honest (e.g., if\nan observer were run by the network owner). Also, by extending our condition to\ncoalitions, we show that there are generally no collusion-resistant mechanisms\nin the settings that we consider.\n  We apply our framework and results to two DePIN applications: proving\nlocation, and proving bandwidth. In the location-proving setting observers\nlearn (potentially enlarged) Euclidean distances to the source. Here, our\ncondition has an appealing geometric interpretation, implying that the source's\nlocation can be truthfully elicited if and only if it is guaranteed to lie\ninside the convex hull of the observers.", "published": "2025-03-10 17:28:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07558v1", "categories": ["cs.GT", "cs.ET", "cs.LG", "econ.TH", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.GT"}
{"title": "FinTSBridge: A New Evaluation Suite for Real-world Financial Prediction with Advanced Time Series Models", "abstract": "Despite the growing attention to time series forecasting in recent years,\nmany studies have proposed various solutions to address the challenges\nencountered in time series prediction, aiming to improve forecasting\nperformance. However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models\nto the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is\nstill a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting\nmodels with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the\nfollowing efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain;\n2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and\nvalidated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new\nmetrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series\ncorrelation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for\nthese three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application\npotential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope\nthe developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights\ninto the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in\nfinanical domains.", "published": "2025-03-10 05:19:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06928v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
