{"title": "Heterogenous Macro-Finance Model: A Mean-field Game Approach", "abstract": "We investigate the full dynamics of capital allocation and wealth\ndistribution of heterogeneous agents in a frictional economy during booms and\nbusts using tools from mean-field games. Two groups in our models, namely the\nexpert and the household, are interconnected within and between their classes\nthrough the law of capital processes and are bound by financial constraints.\nSuch a mean-field interaction explains why experts accumulate a lot of capital\nin the good times and reverse their behavior quickly in the bad times even in\nthe absence of aggregate macro-shocks. When common noises from the market are\ninvolved, financial friction amplifies the mean-field effect and leads to\ncapital fire sales by experts. In addition, the implicit interlink between and\nwithin heterogeneous groups demonstrates the slow economic recovery and\ncharacterizes the deviating and fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) behaviors of\nhouseholds compared to their counterparts. Our model also gives a fairly\nexplicit representation of the equilibrium solution without exploiting\ncomplicated numerical approaches.", "published": "2025-02-15 04:21:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10666v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
