{"title": "Conditional Random Field Autoencoders for Unsupervised Structured\n  Prediction", "abstract": "We introduce a framework for unsupervised learning of structured predictors\nwith overlapping, global features. Each input's latent representation is\npredicted conditional on the observable data using a feature-rich conditional\nrandom field. Then a reconstruction of the input is (re)generated, conditional\non the latent structure, using models for which maximum likelihood estimation\nhas a closed-form. Our autoencoder formulation enables efficient learning\nwithout making unrealistic independence assumptions or restricting the kinds of\nfeatures that can be used. We illustrate insightful connections to traditional\nautoencoders, posterior regularization and multi-view learning. We show\ncompetitive results with instantiations of the model for two canonical NLP\ntasks: part-of-speech induction and bitext word alignment, and show that\ntraining our model can be substantially more efficient than comparable\nfeature-rich baselines.", "published": "2014-11-05 04:49:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1147v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Using Twitter to predict football outcomes", "abstract": "Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling on\nvarious domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases or\nsports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football\n(soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined\nfrom Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models\nfor the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month\nperiod based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome\npredictive models which use only historical data and simple football\nstatistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and\nhistorical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can\nindeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final\nTwitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured by\nCohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and\nhistorical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it\nwas achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence\nthat Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the\nprediction of football (soccer) outcomes.", "published": "2014-11-05 11:50:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.SI", "I.2.m"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
