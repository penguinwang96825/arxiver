{"title": "The eternal dominating set problem for interval graphs", "abstract": "We prove that, in games in which all the guards move at the same turn, the eternal domination and the clique-connected cover numbers coincide for interval graphs. A linear algorithm for the eternal dominating set problem is obtained as a by-product.", "published": "2018-08-29 00:40:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09591v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Counting Independent Sets in Cocomparability Graphs", "abstract": "We show that the number of independent sets in cocomparability graphs can be counted in linear time, as can counting cliques in comparability graphs. By contrast, counting cliques in cocomparabilty graphs and counting independent sets in comparability graphs are #P-complete. We extend these results to counting maximal cliques and independent sets. We also consider the fixed-parameter versions of counting cliques and independent sets of given size $k$. Finally, we combine the results to show that both counting cliques and independent sets in permutation graphs are in linear time.", "published": "2018-08-29 14:40:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09853v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
