{"title": "DeepRec: An Open-source Toolkit for Deep Learning based Recommendation", "abstract": "Deep learning based recommender systems have been extensively explored in recent years. However, the large number of models proposed each year poses a big challenge for both researchers and practitioners in reproducing the results for further comparisons. Although a portion of papers provides source code, they adopted different programming languages or different deep learning packages, which also raises the bar in grasping the ideas. To alleviate this problem, we released the open source project: \\textbf{DeepRec}. In this toolkit, we have implemented a number of deep learning based recommendation algorithms using Python and the widely used deep learning package - Tensorflow. Three major recommendation scenarios: rating prediction, top-N recommendation (item ranking) and sequential recommendation, were considered. Meanwhile, DeepRec maintains good modularity and extensibility to easily incorporate new models into the framework. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

{"title": "Finding new routes for integrating Multi-Agent Systems using Apache Camel", "abstract": "In Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) there are two main models of interaction: among agents, and between agents and the environment. Although there are studies considering these models, there is no practical tool to afford the interaction with external entities with both models. This paper presents a proposal for such a tool based on the Apache Camel framework by designing two new components, namely camel-jason and camel-artifact. By means of these components, an external entity is modelled according to its nature, i.e., whether it is autonomous or non-autonomous, interacting with the MAS respectively as an agent or an artifact. It models coherently external entities whereas Camel provides interoperability with several communication protocols.", "published": "2019-05-25 00:26:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10490v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
