{"title": "On the Bias of Reed-Muller Codes over Odd Prime Fields", "abstract": "We study the bias of random bounded-degree polynomials over odd prime fields and show that, with probability exponentially close to 1, such polynomials have exponentially small bias. This also yields an exponential tail bound on the weight distribution of Reed-Muller codes over odd prime fields. These results generalize bounds of Ben-Eliezer, Hod, and Lovett who proved similar results over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A key to our bounds is the proof of a new precise extremal property for the rank of sub-matrices of the generator matrices of Reed-Muller codes over odd prime fields. This extremal property is a substantial extension of an extremal property shown by Keevash and Sudakov for the case of $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n  Our exponential tail bounds on the bias can be used to derive exponential lower bounds on the time for space-bounded learning of bounded-degree polynomials from their evaluations over odd prime fields.", "published": "2018-06-18 22:35:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06973v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CC", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Exploring the Interconnectedness of Cryptocurrencies using Correlation Networks", "abstract": "Correlation networks were used to detect characteristics which, although fixed over time, have an important influence on the evolution of prices over time. Potentially important features were identified using the websites and whitepapers of cryptocurrencies with the largest userbases. These were assessed using two datasets to enhance robustness: one with fourteen cryptocurrencies beginning from 9 November 2017, and a subset with nine cryptocurrencies starting 9 September 2016, both ending 6 March 2018. Separately analysing the subset of cryptocurrencies raised the number of data points from 115 to 537, and improved robustness to changes in relationships over time. Excluding USD Tether, the results showed a positive association between different cryptocurrencies that was statistically significant. Robust, strong positive associations were observed for six cryptocurrencies where one was a fork of the other; Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash was an exception. There was evidence for the existence of a group of cryptocurrencies particularly associated with Cardano, and a separate group correlated with Ethereum. The data was not consistent with a token's functionality or creation mechanism being the dominant determinants of the evolution of prices over time but did suggest that factors other than speculation contributed to the price.", "published": "2018-06-18 12:49:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06632v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
