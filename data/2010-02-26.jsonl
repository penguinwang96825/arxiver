{"title": "Multiarray Signal Processing: Tensor decomposition meets compressed sensing", "abstract": "We discuss how recently discovered techniques and tools from compressed sensing can be used in tensor decompositions, with a view towards modeling signals from multiple arrays of multiple sensors. We show that with appropriate bounds on a measure of separation between radiating sources called coherence, one could always guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a best rank-r approximation of the tensor representing the signal. We also deduce a computationally feasible variant of Kruskal's uniqueness condition, where the coherence appears as a proxy for k-rank. Problems of sparsest recovery with an infinite continuous dictionary, lowest-rank tensor representation, and blind source separation are treated in a uniform fashion. The decomposition of the measurement tensor leads to simultaneous localization and extraction of radiating sources, in an entirely deterministic manner.", "published": "2010-02-26 08:00:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4935v3", "categories": ["math.NA", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "math.NA"}
