{"title": "Bidirectional American Sign Language to English Translation", "abstract": "We outline a bidirectional translation system that converts sentences from\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) to English, and vice versa. To perform machine\ntranslation between ASL and English, we utilize a generative approach.\nSpecifically, we employ an adjustment to the IBM word-alignment model 1 (IBM\nWAM1), where we define language models for English and ASL, as well as a\ntranslation model, and attempt to generate a translation that maximizes the\nposterior distribution defined by these models. Then, using these models, we\nare able to quantify the concepts of fluency and faithfulness of a translation\nbetween languages.", "published": "2017-01-10 21:45:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02795v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Implicitly Incorporating Morphological Information into Word Embedding", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose three novel models to enhance word embedding by\nimplicitly using morphological information. Experiments on word similarity and\nsyntactic analogy show that the implicit models are superior to traditional\nexplicit ones. Our models outperform all state-of-the-art baselines and\nsignificantly improve the performance on both tasks. Moreover, our performance\non the smallest corpus is similar to the performance of CBOW on the corpus\nwhich is five times the size of ours. Parameter analysis indicates that the\nimplicit models can supplement semantic information during the word embedding\ntraining process.", "published": "2017-01-10 08:59:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02481v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Simple and Accurate Syntax-Agnostic Neural Model for Dependency-based\n  Semantic Role Labeling", "abstract": "We introduce a simple and accurate neural model for dependency-based semantic\nrole labeling. Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on\nstates of a bidirectional LSTM encoder. The semantic role labeler achieves\ncompetitive performance on English, even without any kind of syntactic\ninformation and only using local inference. However, when automatically\npredicted part-of-speech tags are provided as input, it substantially\noutperforms all previous local models and approaches the best reported results\non the English CoNLL-2009 dataset. We also consider Chinese, Czech and Spanish\nwhere our approach also achieves competitive results. Syntactic parsers are\nunreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e., syntactically-informed)\nSRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. Our syntax-agnostic model\nappears more robust, resulting in the best reported results on standard\nout-of-domain test sets.", "published": "2017-01-10 14:01:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02593v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multi-task Learning Of Deep Neural Networks For Audio Visual Automatic\n  Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) involves the simultaneous training of two or more\nrelated tasks over shared representations. In this work, we apply MTL to\naudio-visual automatic speech recognition(AV-ASR).

This is combined with an auxiliary task which maps\nvisual features to frame labels obtained from a separate visual GMM/HMM model.\nThe MTL model is tested at various levels of babble noise and the results are\ncompared with a base-line hybrid DNN-HMM AV-ASR model. Our results indicate\nthat MTL is especially useful at higher level of noise.

{"title": "Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural\n  Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing\nspectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems\nincorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models\n(HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks.\nMeanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it\nfeasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid\nsettings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult\nto train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC\napproach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by\ncombining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By\nevaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the\nproposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with\nthe existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability\nto model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.", "published": "2017-01-10 18:30:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02720v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
