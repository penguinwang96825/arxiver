{"title": "A multi-factor model for improved commodity pricing: Calibration and an application to the oil market", "abstract": "We present a new model for commodity pricing that enhances accuracy by\nintegrating four distinct risk factors: spot price, stochastic volatility,\nconvenience yield, and stochastic interest rates. While the influence of these\nfour variables on commodity futures prices is well recognized, their combined\neffect has not been addressed in the existing literature. We fill this gap by\nproposing a model that effectively captures key stylized facts including a\ndynamic correlation structure and time-varying risk premiums. Using a Kalman\nfilter-based framework, we achieve simultaneous estimation of parameters while\nfiltering state variables through the joint term structure of futures prices\nand bond yields. We perform an empirical analysis focusing on crude oil\nfutures, where we benchmark our model against established approaches. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed four-factor model effectively captures\nthe complexities of futures term structures and outperforms existing models.", "published": "2025-01-26 16:49:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15596v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
