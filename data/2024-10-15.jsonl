{"title": "Quantum Computing for Multi Period Asset Allocation", "abstract": "Portfolio construction has been a long-standing topic of research in finance.\nThe computational complexity and the time taken both increase rapidly with the\nnumber of investments in the portfolio. It becomes difficult, even impossible\nfor classic computers to solve. Quantum computing is a new way of computing\nwhich takes advantage of quantum superposition and entanglement. It changes how\nsuch problems are approached and is not constrained by some of the classic\ncomputational complexity. Studies have shown that quantum computing can offer\nsignificant advantages over classical computing in many fields. The application\nof quantum computing has been constrained by the unavailability of actual\nquantum computers. In the past decade, there has been the rapid development of\nthe large-scale quantum computer. However, software development for quantum\ncomputing is slow in many fields. In our study, we apply quantum computing to a\nmulti-asset portfolio simulation. The simulation is based on historic data,\ncovariance, and expected returns, all calculated using quantum computing.\nAlthough technically a solvable problem for classical computing, we believe the\nsoftware development is important to the future application of quantum\ncomputing in finance. We conducted this study through simulation of a quantum\ncomputer and the use of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's IBM quantum\ncomputer.", "published": "2024-10-15 19:04:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11997v1", "categories": ["cs.CE", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CE"}
{"title": "Solving The Dynamic Volatility Fitting Problem: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", "abstract": "The volatility fitting is one of the core problems in the equity derivatives\nbusiness. Through a set of deterministic rules, the degrees of freedom in the\nimplied volatility surface encoding (parametrization, density, diffusion) are\ndefined. Whilst very effective, this approach widespread in the industry is not\nnatively tailored to learn from shifts in market regimes and discover\nunsuspected optimal behaviors. In this paper, we change the classical paradigm\nand apply the latest advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) to solve the\nfitting problem. In particular, we show that variants of Deep Deterministic\nPolicy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) can achieve at least as good\nas standard fitting algorithms. Furthermore, we explain why the reinforcement\nlearning framework is appropriate to handle complex objective functions and is\nnatively adapted for online learning.", "published": "2024-10-15 17:10:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11789v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.OC", "math.PR", "q-fin.RM", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Exploiting Risk-Aversion and Size-dependent fees in FX Trading with Fitted Natural Actor-Critic", "abstract": "In recent years, the popularity of artificial intelligence has surged due to\nits widespread application in various fields. The financial sector has\nharnessed its advantages for multiple purposes, including the development of\nautomated trading systems designed to interact autonomously with markets to\npursue different aims. In this work, we focus on the possibility of recognizing\nand leveraging intraday price patterns in the Foreign Exchange market, known\nfor its extensive liquidity and flexibility. Our approach involves the\nimplementation of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Fitted Natural\nActor-Critic. This algorithm allows the training of an agent capable of\neffectively trading by means of continuous actions, which enable the\npossibility of executing orders with variable trading sizes. This feature is\ninstrumental to realistically model transaction costs, as they typically depend\non the order size. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of risk-averse\napproaches to induce the agent to adopt more conservative behavior. The\nproposed approaches have been empirically validated on EUR-USD historical data.", "published": "2024-10-15 13:13:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23294v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Generalized Distribution Prediction for Asset Returns", "abstract": "We present a novel approach for predicting the distribution of asset returns\nusing a quantile-based method with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our\nmodel is designed in two stages: the first focuses on predicting the quantiles\nof normalized asset returns using asset-specific features, while the second\nstage incorporates market data to adjust these predictions for broader economic\nconditions. This results in a generalized model that can be applied across\nvarious asset classes, including commodities, cryptocurrencies, as well as\nsynthetic datasets. The predicted quantiles are then converted into full\nprobability distributions through kernel density estimation, allowing for more\nprecise return distribution predictions and inferencing. The LSTM model\nsignificantly outperforms a linear quantile regression baseline by 98% and a\ndense neural network model by over 50%, showcasing its ability to capture\ncomplex patterns in financial return distributions across both synthetic and\nreal-world data. By using exclusively asset-class-neutral features, our model\nachieves robust, generalizable results.", "published": "2024-10-15 15:31:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23296v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
