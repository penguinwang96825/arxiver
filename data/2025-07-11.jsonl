We identify two key challenges: degraded\nfeatures from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To\ntackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information\nRebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR\nmitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based\nsparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality\nsignals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses\nlocal morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.\nExperiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior\ngeneralization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer\nmultimodal prognosis.

{"title": "The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?", "abstract": "The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the\nopaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural\nnetwork can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a\nfunction which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy.

We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable,\nand decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial\ntime. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by\ndefining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which\ngeneralize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the\nclass H.

Given that any level-set function\nwith a constant level set corresponding to the surface can be used for such\nestimations, numerical methods need not specify a unique target function for\nthe domain-type interpolation problems. In this paper, we focus on kernel-based\ninterpolation by radial basis functions (RBF) and reformulate the uniquely\nsolvable interpolation problem into a constrained optimization model. This\nmodel minimizes some user-defined norm while enforcing all interpolation\nconditions. To enable nontrivial feasible solutions, we propose to enhance the\ntrial space with 1D kernel basis functions inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (KANs). Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed mixed\ndimensional trial space significantly improves surface reconstruction from raw\npoint clouds. This is particularly evident in the precise estimation of surface\nnormals, outperforming traditional RBF trial spaces including the one for\nHermite interpolation. This framework not only enhances processing of raw point\ncloud data but also shows potential for further contributions to computational\ngeometry.

{"title": "Computational algorithm for downward continuation of gravity anomalies", "abstract": "The downward continuation of potential fields from the Earth's surface into\nthe subsurface is a critical task in gravity exploration, as it helps to\nidentify the sources of gravity anomalies. This problem is often addressed by\nsolving a first-kind integral equation using regularization techniques to\nstabilize an inherently unstable process. A similar approach is used in our\nwork, where the continued field is represented as the potential of a simple\nlayer or its vertical derivative. The constancy of the density sign of this\nequivalent simple layer preserves the sign of anomalies, provided that the\nlayer's surface encloses all anomalous sources. This constraint is a key\nfeature of our algorithm for the downward continuation of potential fields.

{"title": "Effective regions and kernels in continuous sparse regularisation, with application to sketched mixtures", "abstract": "This paper advances the general theory of continuous sparse regularisation on\nmeasures with the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO). This TV-regularized convex program\non the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy\nobservation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have\nuncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in\norder to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local\npositive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In\npractice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved.\nAt the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the\nmodel kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known\nLPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding\nconditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list\nof LPC-kernels, proving that the \"sinc-4\" kernel, used for signal recovery and\nmixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show\nthat the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the\nnoise level, leading to effective near regions. This improves on known results\nwhere this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel.\nWe illustrate the interest of our results in the case of translation-invariant\nmixture model estimation, using bandlimiting smoothing and sketching techniques\nto reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.", "published": "2025-07-11 09:35:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08444v1", "categories": ["math.ST", "stat.ML", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "math.ST"}
{"title": "Improving gravitational wave search sensitivity with TIER: Trigger Inference using Extended strain Representation", "abstract": "We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\\texttt{TIER}$ for\nimproving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines.

However, extended strain\ndata ($\\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable\ncomplementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently\ncaptured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary\nrepresentation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train\nand can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and\nwithout requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our\nmodel can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search\npipeline.

{"title": "Exploiting Cognition in ISAR Processing for Spectral Compatibility Applications", "abstract": "This paper introduces and analyzes the concept of a cognitive inverse\nsynthetic aperture radar (ISAR) ensuring spectral compatibility in crowded\nelectromagnetic environments.

The perception is carried out by a\nspectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the\nsources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design\nprocess, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling\nISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other\nradio frequency (RF) sources. A key enabling requirement for the proposed\napplication is the capability to successfully recover possible missing data in\nthe frequency domain (induced by spectral notches) and in the slow-time\ndimension (enabling concurrent RF activities still in a cognitive fashion).\nThis process is carried out by resorting to advanced methods based on either\nthe compressed-sensing framework or a rank-minimization recovery strategy.
