{"title": "Speculative trading: the price multiplier effect", "abstract": "During a speculative episode the price of an item jumps from an initial level p_1 to a peak level p_2 before more or less returning to level p_1. The ratio p_2/p_1 is referred to as the amplitude A of the peak. This paper shows that for a given market the peak amplitude is a linear function of the logarithm of the price at the beginning of the speculative episode; with p_1 expressed in 1999 euros the relationship takes the form:\n  $ A=a\\ln p_1 +b $; the values of the parameter a turn out to be relatively independent of the market considered: $ a \\simeq 0.5 $, the values of the parameter b are more market-dependent, but are stable in the course of time for a given market. This relationship suggests that the higher the stakes the more \"bullish\" the market becomes. Possible mechanisms of this \"risk affinity\" effect are discussed.", "published": "1999-10-23 18:11:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9910376v1", "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.stat-mech"}
