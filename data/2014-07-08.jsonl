A 1-7 rating scale was used to indicate different levels of\nreadability. We obtained moderate to fair agreement among seven independent\nannotators on 30 text passages written by four eminent Bengali authors. As a by\nproduct of our study, we obtained a readability-annotated ground truth dataset\nin Bengali. .", "published": "2014-07-08 07:35:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1976v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Assamese-English Bilingual Machine Translation", "abstract": "Machine translation is the process of translating text from one language to\nanother. In this paper, Statistical Machine Translation is done on Assamese and\nEnglish language by taking their respective parallel corpus. A statistical\nphrase based translation toolkit Moses is used here. To develop the language\nmodel and to align the words we used two another tools IRSTLM, GIZA\nrespectively. BLEU score is used to check our translation system performance,\nhow good it is. A difference in BLEU scores is obtained while translating\nsentences from Assamese to English and vice-versa. Since Indian languages are\nmorphologically very rich hence translation is relatively harder from English\nto Assamese resulting in a low BLEU score. A statistical transliteration system\nis also introduced with our translation system to deal basically with proper\nnouns, OOV (out of vocabulary) words which are not present in our corpus.", "published": "2014-07-08 10:04:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2019v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
