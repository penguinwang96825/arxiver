{"title": "Defining implication relation for classical logic", "abstract": "In classical logic, ''P implies Q'' is equivalent to ''not-P or Q''. It is\nwell known that the equivalence is problematic. Actually, from ''P implies Q'',\n''not-P or Q'' can be inferred (''Implication-to-Disjunction'' is valid),\nwhereas from ''not-P or Q'', ''P implies Q'' cannot be inferred in general\n(''Disjunction-to-Implication'' is not generally valid), so the equivalence\nbetween them is invalid in general. This work aims to remove the incorrect\nDisjunction-to-Implication from classical logic (CL). The paper proposes a\nlogic (IRL) with the expected properties: (a) CL is obtained by adding\nDisjunction-to-Implication to IRL, and (b) Disjunction-to-Implication is not\nderivable in IRL; while (c) fundamental laws in classical logic -- including\nlaw of excluded middle and principle of double negation, law of\nnon-contradiction and ex contradictione quodlibet, conjunction elimination and\ndisjunction introduction, and hypothetical syllogism and disjunctive syllogism\n-- are all retained in IRL.", "published": "2013-12-30 19:33:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7832v11", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
