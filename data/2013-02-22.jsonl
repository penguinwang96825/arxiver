{"title": "Development of Yes/No Arabic Question Answering System", "abstract": "Developing Question Answering systems has been one of the important research\nissues because it requires insights from a variety of\ndisciplines,including,Artificial Intelligence,Information Retrieval,\nInformation Extraction,Natural Language Processing, and Psychology.In this\npaper we realize a formal model for a lightweight semantic based open domain\nyes/no Arabic question answering system based on paragraph retrieval with\nvariable length. We propose a constrained semantic representation. Using an\nexplicit unification framework based on semantic similarities and query\nexpansion synonyms and antonyms.This frequently improves the precision of the\nsystem. Employing the passage retrieval system achieves a better precision by\nretrieving more paragraphs that contain relevant answers to the question; It\nsignificantly reduces the amount of text to be processed by the system.", "published": "2013-02-22 18:59:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5675v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "14J26"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Stochastic dynamics of lexicon learning in an uncertain and nonuniform\n  world", "abstract": "We study the time taken by a language learner to correctly identify the\nmeaning of all words in a lexicon under conditions where many plausible\nmeanings can be inferred whenever a word is uttered. We show that the most\nbasic form of cross-situational learning - whereby information from multiple\nepisodes is combined to eliminate incorrect meanings - can perform badly when\nwords are learned independently and meanings are drawn from a nonuniform\ndistribution. If learners further assume that no two words share a common\nmeaning, we find a phase transition between a maximally-efficient learning\nregime, where the learning time is reduced to the shortest it can possibly be,\nand a partially-efficient regime where incorrect candidate meanings for words\npersist at late times. We obtain exact results for the word-learning process\nthrough an equivalence to a statistical mechanical problem of enumerating loops\nin the space of word-meaning mappings.", "published": "2013-02-22 09:23:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5526v2", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.CL", "q-bio.NC"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
