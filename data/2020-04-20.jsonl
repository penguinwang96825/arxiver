{"title": "Semi-closed form prices of barrier options in the Hull-White model", "abstract": "In this paper we derive semi-closed form prices of barrier (perhaps, time-dependent) options for the Hull-White model, ie., where the underlying follows a time-dependent OU process with a mean-reverting drift. Our approach is similar to that in (Carr and Itkin, 2020) where the method of generalized integral transform is applied to pricing barrier options in the time-dependent OU model, but extends it to an infinite domain (which is an unsolved problem yet). Alternatively, we use the method of heat potentials for solving the same problems. By semi-closed solution we mean that first, we need to solve numerically a linear Volterra equation of the first kind, and then the option price is represented as a one-dimensional integral. Our analysis shows that computationally our method is more efficient than the backward and even forward finite difference methods (if one uses them to solve those problems), while providing better accuracy and stability.", "published": "2020-04-20 19:35:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09591v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "The new methods for equity fund selection and optimal portfolio construction", "abstract": "We relook at the classic equity fund selection and portfolio construction problems from a new perspective and propose an easy-to-implement framework to tackle the problem in practical investment. Rather than the conventional way by constructing a long only portfolio from a big universe of stocks or macro factors, we show how to produce a long-short portfolio from a smaller pool of stocks from mutual fund top holdings and generate impressive results. As these methods are based on statistical evidence, we need closely monitoring the model validity, and prepare repair strategies.", "published": "2020-04-20 08:24:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10631v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "cs.LG", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
