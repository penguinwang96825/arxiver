{"title": "Towards automating the generation of derivative nouns in Sanskrit by\n  simulating Panini", "abstract": "About 1115 rules in Astadhyayi from A.4.1.76 to A.5.4.160 deal with\ngeneration of derivative nouns, making it one of the largest topical sections\nin Astadhyayi, called as the Taddhita section owing to the head rule A.4.1.76.\nThis section is a systematic arrangement of rules that enumerates various\naffixes that are used in the derivation under specific semantic relations. We\npropose a system that automates the process of generation of derivative nouns\nas per the rules in Astadhyayi. The proposed system follows a completely object\noriented approach, that models each rule as a class of its own and then groups\nthem as rule groups. The rule groups are decided on the basis of selective\ngrouping of rules by virtue of anuvrtti. The grouping of rules results in an\ninheritance network of rules which is a directed acyclic graph. Every rule\ngroup has a head rule and the head rule notifies all the direct member rules of\nthe group about the environment which contains all the details about data\nentities, participating in the derivation process. The system implements this\nmechanism using multilevel inheritance and observer design patterns. The system\nfocuses not only on generation of the desired final form, but also on the\ncorrectness of sequence of rules applied to make sure that the derivation has\ntaken place in strict adherence to Astadhyayi. The proposed system's design\nallows to incorporate various conflict resolution methods mentioned in\nauthentic texts and hence the effectiveness of those rules can be validated\nwith the results from the system. We also present cases where we have checked\nthe applicability of the system with the rules which are not specifically\napplicable to derivation of derivative nouns, in order to see the effectiveness\nof the proposed schema as a generic system for modeling Astadhyayi.", "published": "2015-12-17 16:55:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05670v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Semi-supervised Question Retrieval with Gated Convolutions", "abstract": "Question answering forums are rapidly growing in size with no effective\nautomated ability to refer to and reuse answers already available for previous\nposted questions. In this paper, we develop a methodology for finding\nsemantically related questions. The task is difficult since 1) key pieces of\ninformation are often buried in extraneous details in the question body and 2)\navailable annotations on similar questions are scarce and fragmented. We design\na recurrent and convolutional model (gated convolution) to effectively map\nquestions to their semantic representations. The models are pre-trained within\nan encoder-decoder framework (from body to title) on the basis of the entire\nraw corpus, and fine-tuned discriminatively from limited annotations. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that our model yields substantial gains over a standard\nIR baseline and various neural network architectures (including CNNs, LSTMs and\nGRUs).", "published": "2015-12-17 19:14:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05726v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Kauffman's adjacent possible in word order evolution", "abstract": "Word order evolution has been hypothesized to be constrained by a word order\npermutation ring: transitions involving orders that are closer in the\npermutation ring are more likely. The hypothesis can be seen as a particular\ncase of Kauffman's adjacent possible in word order evolution. Here we consider\nthe problem of the association of the six possible orders of S, V and O to\nyield a couple of primary alternating orders as a window to word order\nevolution. We evaluate the suitability of various competing hypotheses to\npredict one member of the couple from the other with the help of information\ntheoretic model selection. Our ensemble of models includes a six-way model that\nis based on the word order permutation ring (Kauffman's adjacent possible) and\nanother model based on the dual two-way of standard typology, that reduces word\norder to basic orders preferences (e.g., a preference for SV over VS and\nanother for SO over OS). Our analysis indicates that the permutation ring\nyields the best model when favoring parsimony strongly, providing support for\nKauffman's general view and a six-way typology.", "published": "2015-12-17 14:01:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05582v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "physics.data-an", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Survey of Available Corpora for Building Data-Driven Dialogue Systems", "abstract": "During the past decade, several areas of speech and language understanding\nhave witnessed substantial breakthroughs from the use of data-driven models. In\nthe area of dialogue systems, the trend is less obvious, and most practical\nsystems are still built through significant engineering and expert knowledge.\nNevertheless, several recent results suggest that data-driven approaches are\nfeasible and quite promising. To facilitate research in this area, we have\ncarried out a wide survey of publicly available datasets suitable for\ndata-driven learning of dialogue systems. We discuss important characteristics\nof these datasets, how they can be used to learn diverse dialogue strategies,\nand their other potential uses. We also examine methods for transfer learning\nbetween datasets and the use of external knowledge.
