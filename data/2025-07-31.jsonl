{"title": "EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution", "abstract": "Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely\napplied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

{"title": "AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning", "abstract": "Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a\npromising direction in representation learning. However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives.

{"title": "Model Directions, Not Words: Mechanistic Topic Models Using Sparse Autoencoders", "abstract": "Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large\ntext collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words\nrepresentations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While\nsome neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained\nby expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate\ncomplex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic\nmodels that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal\ndeeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,\nuniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using\ntopic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against\nword-list-based approaches, we propose \\textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based\npairwise comparison evaluation framework.

{"title": "Not Just What, But When: Integrating Irregular Intervals to LLM for Sequential Recommendation", "abstract": "Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential\nrecommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and\noften overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,\ndynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not\nonly the history within a user but also different users with the same item\nhistory. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that\nintegrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel\ninterval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and\nintervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start\nscenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new\nviewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for\nevaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines\ndemonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average\nbut also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,\nand the proposed interval perspectives.

One\nreason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all\nnoise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time\nderivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors).\nRecent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable\nproblem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they\nare also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes\nno error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents\nassimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the\nmodel equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small\nyet critical error introduced by numerical truncation.
