{"title": "FinTMMBench: Benchmarking Temporal-Aware Multi-Modal RAG in Finance", "abstract": "Finance decision-making often relies on in-depth data analysis across various\ndata sources, including financial tables, news articles, stock prices, etc. In\nthis work, we introduce FinTMMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating temporal-aware multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nsystems in finance. Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies,\nFinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It\nencompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices,\nand visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each\nquestion requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a\nspecific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual\nperiods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10\ndifferent tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment\nanalysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG\nmethod, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g.,\ntabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates\ntemporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes.\nIts effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps\nremain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.", "published": "2025-03-07 07:13:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05185v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.MM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Multi-asset optimal trade execution with stochastic cross-effects: An Obizhaeva-Wang-type framework", "abstract": "We analyze a continuous-time optimal trade execution problem in multiple\nassets where the price impact and the resilience can be matrix-valued\nstochastic processes that incorporate cross-impact effects. In addition, we\nallow for stochastic terminal and running targets. Initially, we formulate the\noptimal trade execution task as a stochastic control problem with a\nfinite-variation control process that acts as an integrator both in the state\ndynamics and in the cost functional. We then extend this problem continuously\nto a stochastic control problem with progressively measurable controls. By\nidentifying this extended problem as equivalent to a certain linear-quadratic\nstochastic control problem, we can use established results in linear-quadratic\nstochastic control to solve the extended problem. This work generalizes\n[Ackermann, Kruse, Urusov; FinancStoch'24] from the single-asset setting to the\nmulti-asset case. In particular, we reveal cross-hedging effects, showing that\nit can be optimal to trade in an asset despite having no initial position.\nMoreover, as a subsetting we discuss a multi-asset variant of the model in\n[Obizhaeva, Wang; JFinancMark'13].", "published": "2025-03-07 17:22:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05594v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "Distortion risk measures of sums of two counter-monotonic risks", "abstract": "In this paper, we will show that under certain conditions, associated to any\nfixed distortion function $g$, the distortion risk measure of a sum of two\ncounter-monotonic risks can be expressed as the sum of two related distortion\nrisk measures of the marginals involved, one associated to the original\ndistortion function $g$ and the other associated to the dual distortion\nfunction of $g$. This result extends some of the work in \\cite{Chaoubi et al.\n(2020)} and \\cite{HLD} since the class of distortion risk measures includes the\nrisk measure of VaR and TVaR as special cases.", "published": "2025-03-07 09:14:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05256v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Modeling metaorder impact with a Non-Markovian Zero Intelligence model", "abstract": "Devising models of the limit order book that realistically reproduce the\nmarket response to exogenous trades is extremely challenging and fundamental in\norder to test trading strategies. We propose a novel explainable model for\nsmall tick assets, the Non-Markovian Zero Intelligence, which is a variant of\nthe well-known Zero Intelligence model. The main modification is that the\nprobability of limit orders' signs (buy/sell) is not constant but is a function\nof the exponentially weighted mid-price return, representing the past price\ndynamics, and can be interpreted as the reaction of traders with reservation\nprices to the price trend. With numerical simulations and analytical arguments,\nwe show that the model predicts a concave price path during a metaorder\nexecution and to a price reversion after the execution ends, as empirically\nobserved. We analyze in-depth the mechanism at the root of the arising\nconcavity, the components which constitute the price impact in our model, and\nthe dependence of the results on the two main parameters, namely the time scale\nand the strength of the reaction of traders to the price trend.", "published": "2025-03-07 09:10:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05254v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
