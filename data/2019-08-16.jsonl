{"title": "On non-uniqueness in mean field games", "abstract": "We analyze an $N+1$-player game and the corresponding mean field game with state space $\\{0,1\\}$. The transition rate of $j$-th player is the sum of his control $\u03b1^j$ plus a minimum jumping rate $\u03b7$. Instead of working under monotonicity conditions, here we consider an anti-monotone running cost. We show that the mean field game equation may have multiple solutions if $\u03b7< \\frac{1}{2}$. We also prove that that although multiple solutions exist, only the one coming from the entropy solution is charged (when $\u03b7=0$), and therefore resolve a conjecture of ArXiv: 1903.05788.", "published": "2019-08-16 23:57:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06207v2", "categories": ["math.PR", "math.OC", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
