{"title": "GAE-ISumm: Unsupervised Graph-Based Summarization of Indian Languages", "abstract": "Document summarization aims to create a precise and coherent summary of a\ntext document. Many deep learning summarization models are developed mainly for\nEnglish, often requiring a large training corpus and efficient pre-trained\nlanguage models and tools. However, English summarization models for\nlow-resource Indian languages are often limited by rich morphological\nvariation, syntax, and semantic differences. In this paper, we propose\nGAE-ISumm, an unsupervised Indic summarization model that extracts summaries\nfrom text documents. In particular, our proposed model, GAE-ISumm uses Graph\nAutoencoder (GAE) to learn text representations and a document summary jointly.\nWe also provide a manually-annotated Telugu summarization dataset TELSUM, to\nexperiment with our model GAE-ISumm. Further, we experiment with the most\npublicly available Indian language summarization datasets to investigate the\neffectiveness of GAE-ISumm on other Indian languages. Our experiments of\nGAE-ISumm in seven languages make the following observations: (i) it is\ncompetitive or better than state-of-the-art results on all datasets, (ii) it\nreports benchmark results on TELSUM, and (iii) the inclusion of positional and\ncluster information in the proposed model improved the performance of\nsummaries.", "published": "2022-12-25 17:20:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12937v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Search, Structure, and Sentiment: A Comparative Analysis of Network\n  Opinion in Different Query Types on Twitter", "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between structure and sentiment is essential\nin highlighting future operations with online social networks. More\nspecifically, within popular conversation on Twitter. This paper provides a\ndevelopment on the relationship between the two variables: structure, defined\nas the composition of a directed network, and sentiment, a quantified value of\nthe positive/negative connotations of a conversation. We highlight thread\nsentiment to be inversely proportional to the strength and connectivity of a\nnetwork. The second portion of this paper highlights differences in query\ntypes, specifically how the aforementioned behavior differs within four key\nquery types. This paper focuses on topical, event-based, geographic, and\nindividual queries as orientations which have differing behavior. Using\ncross-query analysis, we see that the relationship between structure and\nsentiment, though still inversely proportional, differs greatly across query\ntypes. We find this relationship to be the most clear within the individual\nqueries and the least prevalent within the event-based queries. This paper\nprovides a sociological progression in our understanding of opinion and\nnetworks, while providing a methodological advancement for future studies on\nsimilar subjects.", "published": "2022-12-25 20:48:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12955v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
