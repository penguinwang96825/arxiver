{"title": "Variance-Hawkes Process and its Application to Energy Markets", "abstract": "We define a new model using a Hawkes process as a subordinator in a standard\nBrownian motion. We demonstrate that this Hawkes subordinated Brownian motion\nor more succinctly, variance-Hawkes process can be fit to 2018 and 2019 natural\ngas and crude oil front-month futures log returns. This variance-Hawkes process\nallows financial models to easily have clustering effects encoded into their\nbehaviour in a simple and tractable way. We also compare the simulations of a\nsquare of a variance Hawkes process with its Ito formula. We simulate both\nprocesses and compare their distributions, trajectories, and percent errors\nacross multiple runs. We derive the generator relating to this Hawkes\nsubordinated Brownian motion, calculate several moments, and conjecture its\ndistribution. We also provide explicit solutions to the second moments of the\nHawkes process and its intensity as well as the cross moment between the Hawkes\nprocess and its intensity in the case of an exponential kernel.", "published": "2024-10-10 23:44:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08420v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Optimal mutual insurance against systematic longevity risk", "abstract": "We mathematically demonstrate how and what it means for two collective\npension funds to mutually insure one another against systematic longevity risk.\nThe key equation that facilitates the exchange of insurance is a market\nclearing condition. This enables an insurance market to be established even if\nthe two funds face the same mortality risk, so long as they have different risk\npreferences. Provided the preferences of the two funds are not too dissimilar,\ninsurance provides little benefit, implying the base scheme is effectively\noptimal. When preferences vary significantly, insurance can be beneficial.", "published": "2024-10-10 09:26:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07749v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Fitting the seven-parameter Generalized Tempered Stable distribution to the financial data", "abstract": "The paper proposes and implements a methodology to fit a seven-parameter\nGeneralized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution to financial data. The\nnonexistence of the mathematical expression of the GTS probability density\nfunction makes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) inadequate for providing\nparameter estimations. Based on the function characteristic and the fractional\nFourier transform (FRFT), we provide a comprehensive approach to circumvent the\nproblem and yield a good parameter estimation of the GTS probability. The\nmethodology was applied to fit two heavily tailed data (Bitcoin and Ethereum\nreturns) and two peaked data (S\\&P 500 and SPY ETF returns). For each index,\nthe estimation results show that the six-parameter estimations are\nstatistically significant except for the local parameter, $\\mu$. The\ngoodness-of-fit was assessed through Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, and\nPearson's chi-squared statistics. While the two-parameter geometric Brownian\nmotion (GBM) hypothesis is always rejected, the GTS distribution fits\nsignificantly with a very high p-value; and outperforms the Kobol,\nCarr-Geman-Madan-Yor, and Bilateral Gamma distributions.", "published": "2024-10-10 23:05:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19751v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "TraderTalk: An LLM Behavioural ABM applied to Simulating Human Bilateral Trading Interactions", "abstract": "We introduce a novel hybrid approach that augments Agent-Based Models (ABMs)\nwith behaviors generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human\ntrading interactions. We call our model TraderTalk. Leveraging LLMs trained on\nextensive human-authored text, we capture detailed and nuanced representations\nof bilateral conversations in financial trading. Applying this Generative\nAgent-Based Model (GABM) to government bond markets, we replicate trading\ndecisions between two stylised virtual humans. Our method addresses both\nstructural challenges, such as coordinating turn-taking between realistic\nLLM-based agents, and design challenges, including the interpretation of LLM\noutputs by the agent model. By exploring prompt design opportunistically rather\nthan systematically, we enhance the realism of agent interactions without\nexhaustive overfitting or model reliance. Our approach successfully replicates\ntrade-to-order volume ratios observed in related asset markets, demonstrating\nthe potential of LLM-augmented ABMs in financial simulations", "published": "2024-10-10 23:58:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21280v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
