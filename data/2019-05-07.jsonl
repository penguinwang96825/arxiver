{"title": "Development of Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing Model for\n  Turkish", "abstract": "Natural language is one of the most fundamental features that distinguish\npeople from other living things and enable people to communicate each other.\nLanguage is a tool that enables people to express their feelings and thoughts\nand to transfers cultures through generations. Texts and audio are examples of\nnatural language in daily life. In the natural language, many words disappear\nin time, on the other hand new words are derived. Therefore, while the process\nof natural language processing (NLP) is complex even for human, it is difficult\nto process in computer system. The area of linguistics examines how people use\nlanguage. NLP, which requires the collaboration of linguists and computer\nscientists, plays an important role in human computer interaction. Studies in\nNLP have increased with the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the\nfield of linguistics. With the deep learning methods which are one of the\nartificial intelligence study areas, platforms close to natural language are\nbeing developed. Developed platforms for language comprehension, machine\ntranslation and part of speech (POS) tagging benefit from deep learning\nmethods. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), one of the deep learning\narchitectures, is preferred for processing sequential data such as text or\naudio data. In this study, Turkish POS tagging model has been proposed by using\nBidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) which is an RNN type. The proposed\nPOS tagging model is provided to natural language researchers with a platform\nthat allows them to perform and use their own analysis. In the development\nphase of the platform developed by using BLSTM, the error rate of the POS\ntagger has been reduced by taking feedback with expert opinion.", "published": "2019-05-07 21:09:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05699v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Interactive Search and Exploration in Online Discussion Forums Using\n  Multimodal Embeddings", "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel interactive multimodal learning system,\nwhich facilitates search and exploration in large networks of social multimedia\nusers. It allows the analyst to identify and select users of interest, and to\nfind similar users in an interactive learning setting. Our approach is based on\nnovel multimodal representations of users, words and concepts, which we\nsimultaneously learn by deploying a general-purpose neural embedding model. We\nshow these representations to be useful not only for categorizing users, but\nalso for automatically generating user and community profiles. Inspired by\ntraditional summarization approaches, we create the profiles by selecting\ndiverse and representative content from all available modalities, i.e. the\ntext, image and user modality. The usefulness of the approach is evaluated\nusing artificial actors, which simulate user behavior in a relevance feedback\nscenario. Multiple experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the quality\nof our multimodal representations, to compare different embedding strategies,\nand to determine the importance of different modalities. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of the proposed approach on two different multimedia collections\noriginating from the violent online extremism forum Stormfront and the\nmicroblogging platform Twitter, which are particularly interesting due to the\nhigh semantic level of the discussions they feature.", "published": "2019-05-07 09:23:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02430v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "MASS: Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training for Language Generation", "abstract": "Pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT, have achieved great success in\nlanguage understanding by transferring knowledge from rich-resource\npre-training task to the low/zero-resource downstream tasks. Inspired by the\nsuccess of BERT, we propose MAsked Sequence to Sequence pre-training (MASS) for\nthe encoder-decoder based language generation tasks. MASS adopts the\nencoder-decoder framework to reconstruct a sentence fragment given the\nremaining part of the sentence: its encoder takes a sentence with randomly\nmasked fragment (several consecutive tokens) as input, and its decoder tries to\npredict this masked fragment. In this way, MASS can jointly train the encoder\nand decoder to develop the capability of representation extraction and language\nmodeling. By further fine-tuning on a variety of zero/low-resource language\ngeneration tasks, including neural machine translation, text summarization and\nconversational response generation (3 tasks and totally 8 datasets), MASS\nachieves significant improvements over the baselines without pre-training or\nwith other pre-training methods. Specially, we achieve the state-of-the-art\naccuracy (37.5 in terms of BLEU score) on the unsupervised English-French\ntranslation, even beating the early attention-based supervised model.", "published": "2019-05-07 10:13:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02450v5", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

In this paper, we build Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models that\ncan classify poems according to their meters from plain text. The input text is\nencoded at the character level and directly fed to the models without feature\nhandcrafting. This is a step forward for machine understanding and synthesis of\nlanguages in general, and Arabic language in particular. Among the 16 poem\nmeters of Arabic and the 4 meters of English the networks were able to\ncorrectly classify poem with an overall accuracy of 96.38\\% and 82.31\\%\nrespectively. The poem datasets used to conduct this research were massive,\nover 1.5 million of verses, and were crawled from different nontechnical\nsources, almost Arabic and English literature sites, and in different\nheterogeneous and unstructured formats. These datasets are now made publicly\navailable in clean, structured, and documented format for other future\nresearch. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is the first to\naddress classifying poem meters in a machine learning approach, in general, and\nin RNN featureless based approach, in particular.
