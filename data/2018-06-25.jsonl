{"title": "Real time state monitoring and fault diagnosis system for motor based on LabVIEW", "abstract": "Motor is the most widely used production equipment in industrial field. In order to realize the real-time state monitoring and multi-fault pre-diagnosis of three-phase motor, this paper presents a design of three-phase motor state monitoring and fault diagnosis system based on LabVIEW.\n  The multi-dimensional vibration acceleration, rotational speed, temperature, current and voltage signals of the motor are collected with NI cDAQ acquisition equipment in real time and high speed. At the same time, the model of motor health state and fault state is established. The order analysis algorithm is used to analyze the data at an advanced level, and the diagnosis and classification of different fault types are realized. The system is equipped with multi-channel acquisition, display, analysis and storage. Combined with the current cloud transmission technology, we will back up the data to the cloud to be used by other terminals.", "published": "2018-06-25 02:37:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09998v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.SE", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
