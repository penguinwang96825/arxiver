{"title": "Multi-Factor Function-on-Function Regression of Bond Yields on WTI Commodity Futures Term Structure Dynamics", "abstract": "In the analysis of commodity futures, it is commonly assumed that futures\nprices are driven by two latent factors: short-term fluctuations and long-term\nequilibrium price levels. In this study, we extend this framework by\nintroducing a novel state-space functional regression model that incorporates\nyield curve dynamics. Our model offers a distinct advantage in capturing the\ninterdependencies between commodity futures and the yield curve. Through a\ncomprehensive empirical analysis of WTI crude oil futures, using US Treasury\nyields as a functional predictor, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of the\nfunctional regression model compared to the Schwartz-Smith two-factor model,\nparticularly in estimating the short-end of the futures curve. Additionally, we\nconduct a stress testing analysis to examine the impact of both temporary and\npermanent shocks to US Treasury yields on futures price estimation.", "published": "2024-12-08 10:53:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05889v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
