{"title": "Efficient Rejection Sampling in the Entropy-Optimal Range", "abstract": "The problem of generating a random variate $X$ from a finite discrete\nprobability distribution $P$ using an entropy source of independent unbiased\ncoin flips is considered. The Knuth and Yao complexity theory of nonuniform\nrandom number generation furnishes a family of \"entropy-optimal\" sampling\nalgorithms that consume between $H(P)$ and $H(P)+2$ coin flips per generated\noutput, where $H$ is the Shannon entropy function. However, the space\ncomplexity of entropy-optimal samplers scales exponentially with the number of\nbits required to encode $P$. This article introduces a family of efficient\nrejection samplers and characterizes their entropy, space, and time complexity.\nWithin this family is a distinguished sampling algorithm that requires\nlinearithmic space and preprocessing time, and whose expected entropy cost\nalways falls in the entropy-optimal range $[H(P), H(P)+2)$. No previous sampler\nfor discrete probability distributions is known to achieve these\ncharacteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate performance improvements in\nruntime and entropy of the proposed algorithm compared to the celebrated alias\nmethod.", "published": "2025-04-05 19:45:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04267v1", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.DM", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "math.PR", "stat.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}

{"title": "Distributed Time Synchronization in NOMA-Assisted Ultra-Dense Networks", "abstract": "Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) represent a transformative access architecture\nfor upcoming sixth generation (6G) systems, poised to meet the surging demand\nfor high data rates. Achieving precise synchronization across diverse base\nstations (BSs) is critical in these networks to mitigate inter-cell\ninterference (ICI). However, traditional centralized synchronization approaches\nface substantial challenges in dense urban, including limited access to Global\nPositioning System (GPS), dependence on reliable backhaul, and high signaling\noverhead demands. This study advances a low-complexity distributed\nsynchronization solution. A primary focus is on assessing the algorithm's\naccuracy incorporating the effects of information exchange delays, which are\npronounced in large-networks. Recognizing the pivotal role of neighbor-gathered\ninformation in the proposed approach, this research employs uplink\nNon-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to reduce message-gathering delays\nbetween transmitters (TXs) and receivers (RXs). The proposed algorithm is\nevaluated to assess effectiveness under exchange delays, analyzing impact of\nsystem parameters like network connectivity, size, sub-bands, etc., on\nsynchronization speed. The findings demonstrate that the NOMA-based\ninformation-gathering technique significantly accelerates network\nsynchronization compared to orthogonal access schemes.

We consider a linear controlled dynamic\nequation with state-dependent diffusion, and let the sum of a conventional\nmean-variance utility and a fairly general function of higher-order central\nmoments be the objective functional. We obtain both the sufficiency and\nnecessity of the equilibrium condition for an open-loop Nash equilibrium\ncontrol (ONEC), under some continuity and integrability assumptions that are\nmore relaxed and natural than those employed before. Notably, we derive an\nextended version of the stochastic Lebesgue differentiation theorem for\nnecessity, because the equilibrium condition is represented by some diagonal\nprocesses generated by a flow of backward stochastic differential equations\nwhose the data do not necessarily satisfy the usual square-integrability. Based\non the derived equilibrium condition, we obtain the algebra equation for a\ndeterministic ONEC.

{"title": "Determined blind source separation via modeling adjacent frequency band correlations in speech signals", "abstract": "Multichannel blind source separation (MBSS), which focuses on separating\nsignals of interest from mixed observations, has been extensively studied in\nacoustic and speech processing.
