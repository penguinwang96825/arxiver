{"title": "Trend-encoded Probabilistic Multi-order Model: A Non-Machine Learning Approach for Enhanced Stock Market Forecasts", "abstract": "In recent years, the dominance of machine learning in stock market\nforecasting has been evident. While these models have shown decreasing\nprediction errors, their robustness across different datasets has been a\nconcern. A successful stock market prediction model minimizes prediction errors\nand showcases robustness across various data sets, indicating superior\nforecasting performance. This study introduces a novel multiple lag order\nprobabilistic model based on trend encoding (TeMoP) that enhances stock market\npredictions through a probabilistic approach. Results across different stock\nindexes from nine countries demonstrate that the TeMoP outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art machine learning models in predicting accuracy and\nstabilization.", "published": "2025-02-12 05:54:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08144v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.PR", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

{"title": "Marginal Price Optimization", "abstract": "We introduce a new framework for optimal routing and arbitrage in AMM driven\nmarkets. This framework improves on the original best-practice convex\noptimization by restricting the search to the boundary of the optimal space. We\ncan parameterize this boundary using a set of prices, and a potentially very\nhigh dimensional optimization problem (2 optimization variables per curve) gets\nreduced to a much lower dimensional root finding problem (1 optimization\nvariable per token, regardless of the number of the curves). Our reformulation\nis similar to the dual problem of a reformulation of the original convex\nproblem. We show our reformulation of the problem is equivalent to the original\nformulation except in the case of infinitely concentrated liquidity, where we\nprovide a suitable approximation. Our formulation performs far better than the\noriginal one in terms of speed - we obtain an improvement of up to 200x against\nClarabel, the new CVXPY default solver - and robustness, especially on levered\ncurves.", "published": "2025-02-12 10:05:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08258v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "TLOB: A Novel Transformer Model with Dual Attention for Stock Price Trend Prediction with Limit Order Book Data", "abstract": "Stock Price Trend Prediction (SPTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a\nfundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning,\nexisting models fail to generalize across different market conditions and\nstruggle to reliably predict short-term trends. Surprisingly, by adapting a\nsimple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance;\nthus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that\nshows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a\ndual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB\ndata. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making\nit particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market\nconditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous\nones, removing the horizon bias. We evaluate TLOB's effectiveness using the\nestablished FI-2010 benchmark, which exceeds the state-of-the-art by an average\nof 3.7 F1-score(\\%). Additionally, TLOB shows improvements on Tesla and Intel\nwith a 1.3 and 7.7 increase in F1-score(\\%), respectively. Additionally, we\nempirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time (-6.68\nabsolute points in F1-score(\\%)), highlighting the growing market efficiencies.\nPredictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we\nexperimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the\nprimary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores\nthe complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading\nstrategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving\nlandscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for\nfuture advancements in financial AI. We release the code at\nhttps://github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.", "published": "2025-02-12 12:41:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15757v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Analyzing Communicability and Connectivity in the Indian Stock Market During Crises", "abstract": "In financial networks, information does not always follow the shortest path\nbetween two nodes but may also take alternate routes. Communicability, a\nnetwork measure, resolves this complexity and, in diffusion-like processes,\nprovides a reliable measure of the ease with which information flows between\nnodes. As a result, communicability appears to be an important measure for\ndetecting disturbances in connectivity within financial systems, similar to\ninstability caused by periods of high volatility. This study investigates the\nevolution of communicability measures in the stock networks during periods of\ncrises, showing how systemic shocks strengthen the pairwise interdependence\nbetween stocks in the financial market. In this study, the permutation test\nreveals that approximately 83.5 per cent of stock pairs were found to be\nstatistically significant at the significance level of 0.001 and have an\nincrease in the shortest communicability path length during the crisis than the\nnormal days, indicating enhanced interdependence and heightened information\nflow in the market. Furthermore, we show that when employed as features in the\nclassification model, the network shortest path-based measures, along with\ncommunicability measures, are able to accurately classify between the times\nperiods of market stability and volatility. Additionally, our results show that\nthe geometric measures perform better in terms of classification accuracy than\ntopological measures. These findings provide important insights into market\nbehaviour during times of increased volatility and advance our understanding of\nthe financial market crisis.", "published": "2025-02-12 09:35:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08242v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
