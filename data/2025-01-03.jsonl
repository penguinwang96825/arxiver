{"title": "On consistency of optimal portfolio choice for state-dependent exponential utilities", "abstract": "In an arbitrage-free simple market, we demonstrate that for a class of\nstate-dependent exponential utilities, there exists a unique prediction of the\nrandom risk aversion that ensures the consistency of optimal strategies across\nany time horizon. Our solution aligns with the theory of forward performances,\nwith the added distinction of identifying, among the infinite possible\nsolutions, the one for which the profile remains optimal at all times for the\nmarket-adjusted system of preferences adopted.", "published": "2025-01-03 10:25:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01748v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
