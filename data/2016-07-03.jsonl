{"title": "Context-Dependent Word Representation for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "We first observe a potential weakness of continuous vector representations of\nsymbols in neural machine translation. That is, the continuous vector\nrepresentation, or a word embedding vector, of a symbol encodes multiple\ndimensions of similarity, equivalent to encoding more than one meaning of the\nword. This has the consequence that the encoder and decoder recurrent networks\nin neural machine translation need to spend substantial amount of their\ncapacity in disambiguating source and target words based on the context which\nis defined by a source sentence. Based on this observation, in this paper we\npropose to contextualize the word embedding vectors using a nonlinear\nbag-of-words representation of the source sentence. Additionally, we propose to\nrepresent special tokens (such as numbers, proper nouns and acronyms) with\ntyped symbols to facilitate translating those words that are not well-suited to\nbe translated via continuous vectors. The experiments on En-Fr and En-De reveal\nthat the proposed approaches of contextualization and symbolization improves\nthe translation quality of neural machine translation systems significantly.", "published": "2016-07-03 02:18:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00578v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Visualizing Natural Language Descriptions: A Survey", "abstract": "A natural language interface exploits the conceptual simplicity and\nnaturalness of the language to create a high-level user-friendly communication\nchannel between humans and machines. One of the promising applications of such\ninterfaces is generating visual interpretations of semantic content of a given\nnatural language that can be then visualized either as a static scene or a\ndynamic animation. This survey discusses requirements and challenges of\ndeveloping such systems and reports 26 graphical systems that exploit natural\nlanguage interfaces and addresses both artificial intelligence and\nvisualization aspects. This work serves as a frame of reference to researchers\nand to enable further advances in the field.", "published": "2016-07-03 10:30:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00623v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "cs.GR", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
