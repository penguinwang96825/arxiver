{"title": "A cookbook of translating English to Xapi", "abstract": "The Xapagy cognitive architecture had been designed to perform narrative\nreasoning: to model and mimic the activities performed by humans when\nwitnessing, reading, recalling, narrating and talking about stories. Xapagy\ncommunicates with the outside world using Xapi, a simplified, \"pidgin\" language\nwhich is strongly tied to the internal representation model (instances, scenes\nand verb instances) and reasoning techniques (shadows and headless shadows).\nWhile not fully a semantic equivalent of natural language, Xapi can represent a\nwide range of complex stories. We illustrate the representation technique used\nin Xapi through examples taken from folk physics, folk psychology as well as\nsome more unusual literary examples. We argue that while the Xapi model\nrepresents a conceptual shift from the English representation, the mapping is\nlogical and consistent, and a trained knowledge engineer can translate between\nEnglish and Xapi at near-native speed.", "published": "2013-03-31 22:17:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0715v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
