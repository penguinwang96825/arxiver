{"title": "Word2vec Skip-gram Dimensionality Selection via Sequential Normalized Maximum Likelihood", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel information criteria-based approach to select the dimensionality of the word2vec Skip-gram (SG). From the perspective of the probability theory, SG is considered as an implicit probability distribution estimation under the assumption that there exists a true contextual distribution among words. Therefore, we apply information criteria with the aim of selecting the best dimensionality so that the corresponding model can be as close as possible to the true distribution. We examine the following information criteria for the dimensionality selection problem: the Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, and Sequential Normalized Maximum Likelihood (SNML) criterion. SNML is the total codelength required for the sequential encoding of a data sequence on the basis of the minimum description length. The proposed approach is applied to both the original SG model and the SG Negative Sampling model to clarify the idea of using information criteria. Additionally, as the original SNML suffers from computational disadvantages, we introduce novel heuristics for its efficient computation. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that SNML outperforms both BIC and AIC. In comparison with other evaluation methods for word embedding, the dimensionality selected by SNML is significantly closer to the optimal dimensionality obtained by word analogy or word similarity tasks.", "published": "2020-08-18 03:24:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07720v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "On the Parameterized Complexity Of Grid Contraction", "abstract": "For a family of graphs $\\mathcal{G}$, the $\\mathcal{G}$-\\textsc{Contraction} problem takes as an input a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and the goal is to decide if there exists $F \\subseteq E(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that $G/F$ belongs to $\\mathcal{G}$. Here, $G/F$ is the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all the edges in $F$. In this article, we initiate the study of \\textsc{Grid Contraction} from the parameterized complexity point of view. We present a fixed parameter tractable algorithm, running in time $c^k \\cdot |V(G)|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$, for this problem. We complement this result by proving that unless \u00d0 fails, there is no algorithm for \\textsc{Grid Contraction} with running time $c^{o(k)} \\cdot |V(G)|^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. We also present a polynomial kernel for this problem.", "published": "2020-08-18 14:56:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07967v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Semantic Product Search for Matching Structured Product Catalogs in E-Commerce", "abstract": "Retrieving all semantically relevant products from the product catalog is an important problem in E-commerce. Compared to web documents, product catalogs are more structured and sparse due to multi-instance fields that encode heterogeneous aspects of products (e.g. brand name and product dimensions). In this paper, we propose a new semantic product search algorithm that learns to represent and aggregate multi-instance fields into a document representation using state of the art transformers as encoders. Our experiments investigate two aspects of the proposed approach: (1) effectiveness of field representations and structured matching; (2) effectiveness of adding lexical features to semantic search. After training our models using user click logs from a well-known E-commerce platform, we show that our results provide useful insights for improving product search. Lastly, we present a detailed error analysis to show which types of queries benefited the most by fielded representations and structured matching.", "published": "2020-08-18 23:01:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08180v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "S^3-Rec: Self-Supervised Learning for Sequential Recommendation with Mutual Information Maximization", "abstract": "Recently, significant progress has been made in sequential recommendation with deep learning. Existing neural sequential recommendation models usually rely on the item prediction loss to learn model parameters or data representations. However, the model trained with this loss is prone to suffer from data sparsity problem. Since it overemphasizes the final performance, the association or fusion between context data and sequence data has not been well captured and utilized for sequential recommendation. To tackle this problem, we propose the model S^3-Rec, which stands for Self-Supervised learning for Sequential Recommendation, based on the self-attentive neural architecture. The main idea of our approach is to utilize the intrinsic data correlation to derive self-supervision signals and enhance the data representations via pre-training methods for improving sequential recommendation. For our task, we devise four auxiliary self-supervised objectives to learn the correlations among attribute, item, subsequence, and sequence by utilizing the mutual information maximization (MIM) principle. MIM provides a unified way to characterize the correlation between different types of data, which is particularly suitable in our scenario. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, especially when only limited training data is available. Besides, we extend our self-supervised learning method to other recommendation models, which also improve their performance.", "published": "2020-08-18 11:44:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07873v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}

We take into account the dependencies between the imbalance and spread of the venues, and allow for partial execution of limit orders at different limits as well as market orders. We present a Bayesian update of the model parameters to take into account possibly changing market conditions and propose extensions to include short/long trading signals, market impact or hidden liquidity. To solve the stochastic control problem of the trader we apply the finite difference method and also develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm allowing to consider more complex settings.", "published": "2020-08-18 09:06:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07807v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Long vs Short Time Scales: the Rough Dilemma and Beyond", "abstract": "Using a large dataset on major FX rates, we test the robustness of the rough fractional volatility model over different time scales, by including smoothing and measurement errors into the analysis. Our findings lead to new stylized facts in the log-log plots of the second moments of realized variance increments against lag which exhibit some convexity in addition to the roughness and stationarity of the volatility. The very low perceived Hurst exponents at small scales is consistent with the rough framework, while the higher perceived Hurst exponents for larger scales leads to a nonlinear behavior of the log-log plot that has not been described by models introduced so far.", "published": "2020-08-18 09:31:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07822v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Fast Agent-Based Simulation Framework with Applications to Reinforcement Learning and the Study of Trading Latency Effects", "abstract": "We introduce a new software toolbox for agent-based simulation. Facilitating rapid prototyping by offering a user-friendly Python API, its core rests on an efficient C++ implementation to support simulation of large-scale multi-agent systems. Our software environment benefits from a versatile message-driven architecture. Originally developed to support research on financial markets, it offers the flexibility to simulate a wide-range of different (easily customisable) market rules and to study the effect of auxiliary factors, such as delays, on the market dynamics. As a simple illustration, we employ our toolbox to investigate the role of the order processing delay in normal trading and for the scenario of a significant price change. Owing to its general architecture, our toolbox can also be employed as a generic multi-agent system simulator. We provide an example of such a non-financial application by simulating a mechanism for the coordination of no-regret learning agents in a multi-agent network routing scenario previously proposed in the literature.", "published": "2020-08-18 11:37:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07871v3", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.MA", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Non-Canonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo", "abstract": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is typically based on the assumption of an underlying canonical symplectic structure. Numerical integrators designed for the canonical structure are incompatible with motion generated by non-canonical dynamics. These non-canonical dynamics, motivated by examples in physics and symplectic geometry, correspond to techniques such as preconditioning which are routinely used to improve algorithmic performance. Indeed, recently, a special case of non-canonical structure, magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, was demonstrated to provide advantageous sampling properties. We present a framework for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using non-canonical symplectic structures. Our experimental results demonstrate sampling advantages associated to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with non-canonical structure. To summarize our contributions: (i) we develop non-canonical HMC from foundations in symplectic geomtry; (ii) we construct an HMC procedure using implicit integration that satisfies the detailed balance; (iii) we propose to accelerate the sampling using an {\\em approximate} explicit methodology; (iv) we study two novel, randomly-generated non-canonical structures: magnetic momentum and the coupled magnet structure, with implicit and explicit integration.", "published": "2020-08-18 23:25:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08191v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

For the first time, we introduced the temporal dilated convolutional network with depthwise separable convolutions into the GAN structure so that the receptive field can be greatly increased without increasing the number of parameters. We also first explored the effect of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty item as regularization of the loss function of generator on improving the SNR of enhanced speech. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art end-to-end GAN-based speech enhancement. Moreover, compared with previous GAN-based methods, the proposed TDCGAN could greatly decreased the number of parameters. As expected, the work also demonstrated that the SNR penalty item as regularization was more effective than $L1$ on improving the SNR of enhanced speech.", "published": "2020-08-18 07:50:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07787v2", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
