{"title": "Agent cognition through micro-simulations: Adaptive and tunable intelligence with NetLogo LevelSpace", "abstract": "We present a method of endowing agents in an agent-based model (ABM) with sophisticated cognitive capabilities and a naturally tunable level of intelligence. Often, ABMs use random behavior or greedy algorithms for maximizing objectives (such as a predator always chasing after the closest prey). However, random behavior is too simplistic in many circumstances and greedy algorithms, as well as classic AI planning techniques, can be brittle in the context of the unpredictable and emergent situations in which agents may find themselves. Our method, called agent-centric Monte Carlo cognition (ACMCC), centers around using a separate agent-based model to represent the agents' cognition. This model is then used by the agents in the primary model to predict the outcomes of their actions, and thus guide their behavior. To that end, we have implemented our method in the NetLogo agent-based modeling platform, using the recently released LevelSpace extension, which we developed to allow NetLogo models to interact with other NetLogo models. As an illustrative example, we extend the Wolf Sheep Predation model (included with NetLogo) by using ACMCC to guide animal behavior, and analyze the impact on agent performance and model dynamics. We find that ACMCC provides a reliable and understandable method of controlling agent intelligence, and has a large impact on agent performance and model dynamics even at low settings.", "published": "2018-07-27 22:33:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10847v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Adapting control policies from simulation to reality using a pairwise loss", "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach to domain transfer based on a pairwise loss function that helps transfer control policies learned in simulation onto a real robot. We explore the idea in the context of a 'category level' manipulation task where a control policy is learned that enables a robot to perform a mating task involving novel objects. We explore the case where depth images are used as the main form of sensor input. Our experimental results demonstrate that proposed method consistently outperforms baseline methods that train only in simulation or that combine real and simulated data in a naive way.", "published": "2018-07-27 01:54:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10413v2", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
{"title": "Rob-GAN: Generator, Discriminator, and Adversarial Attacker", "abstract": "We study two important concepts in adversarial deep learning---adversarial training and generative adversarial network (GAN). Adversarial training is the technique used to improve the robustness of discriminator by combining adversarial attacker and discriminator in the training phase. GAN is commonly used for image generation by jointly optimizing discriminator and generator. We show these two concepts are indeed closely related and can be used to strengthen each other---adding a generator to the adversarial training procedure can improve the robustness of discriminators, and adding an adversarial attack to GAN training can improve the convergence speed and lead to better generators. Combining these two insights, we develop a framework called Rob-GAN to jointly optimize generator and discriminator in the presence of adversarial attacks---the generator generates fake images to fool discriminator; the adversarial attacker perturbs real images to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator wants to minimize loss under fake and adversarial images. Through this end-to-end training procedure, we are able to simultaneously improve the convergence speed of GAN training, the quality of synthetic images, and the robustness of discriminator under strong adversarial attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained classifier is more robust than the state-of-the-art adversarial training approach, and the generator outperforms SN-GAN on ImageNet-143.", "published": "2018-07-27 06:50:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10454v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Parallel Transport on the Cone Manifold of SPD Matrices for Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of domain adaptation. We propose to view the data through the lens of covariance matrices and present a method for domain adaptation using parallel transport on the cone manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices. We provide rigorous analysis using Riemanninan geometry, illuminating the theoretical guarantees and benefits of the presented method. In addition, we demonstrate these benefits using experimental results on simulations and real-measured data.", "published": "2018-07-27 08:09:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10479v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
