{"title": "Can market volumes reveal traders' rationality and a new risk premium?", "abstract": "An empirical analysis, suggested by optimal Merton dynamics, reveals some\nunexpected features of asset volumes. These features are connected to traders'\nbelief and risk aversion. This paper proposes a trading strategy model in the\noptimal Merton framework that is representative of the collective behavior of\nheterogeneous rational traders. This model allows for the estimation of the\naverage risk aversion of traders acting on a specific risky asset, while\nrevealing the existence of a price of risk closely related to market price of\nrisk and volume rate. The empirical analysis, conducted on real data, confirms\nthe validity of the proposed model.", "published": "2024-06-09 16:56:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05854v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Electricity Spot Prices Forecasting Using Stochastic Volatility Models", "abstract": "There are several approaches to modeling and forecasting time series as\napplied to prices of commodities and financial assets. One of the approaches is\nto model the price as a non-stationary time series process with heteroscedastic\nvolatility (variance of price). The goal of the research is to generate\nprobabilistic forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices in a spot marker\nemploying stochastic volatility models. A typical stochastic volatility model -\nthat treats the volatility as a latent stochastic process in discrete time - is\nexplored first. Then the research focuses on enriching the baseline model by\nintroducing several exogenous regressors. A better fitting model - as compared\nto the baseline model - is derived as a result of the research. Out-of-sample\nforecasts confirm the applicability and robustness of the enriched model. This\nmodel may be used in financial derivative instruments for hedging the risk\nassociated with electricity trading.

Concerning the\nprice competition, each agent is compared with the best quote from the others.\nWe start with the linear case. While constructing the solution directly, the\nordering property and the dimension reduction in the equilibrium are revealed.\nFor the non-linear case, extending the decoupling approach, we introduce a\nmultidimensional characteristic equation to study the well-posedness of\nforward-backward stochastic differential equations. Properties of coefficients\nin the characteristic equation are obtained via non-smooth analysis. In\naddition to novel well-posedness results, the linear price impact arises and\nthe impact function can be further decomposed into two parts in some examples.", "published": "2024-06-09 06:37:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05662v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
