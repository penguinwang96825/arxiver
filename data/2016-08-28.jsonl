{"title": "Hierarchical Attention Model for Improved Machine Comprehension of\n  Spoken Content", "abstract": "Multimedia or spoken content presents more attractive information than plain\ntext content, but the former is more difficult to display on a screen and be\nselected by a user. As a result, accessing large collections of the former is\nmuch more difficult and time-consuming than the latter for humans. It's\ntherefore highly attractive to develop machines which can automatically\nunderstand spoken content and summarize the key information for humans to\nbrowse over. In this endeavor, a new task of machine comprehension of spoken\ncontent was proposed recently. The initial goal was defined as the listening\ncomprehension test of TOEFL, a challenging academic English examination for\nEnglish learners whose native languages are not English. An Attention-based\nMulti-hop Recurrent Neural Network (AMRNN) architecture was also proposed for\nthis task, which considered only the sequential relationship within the speech\nutterances. In this paper, we propose a new Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM),\nwhich constructs multi-hopped attention mechanism over tree-structured rather\nthan sequential representations for the utterances. Improved comprehension\nperformance robust with respect to ASR errors were obtained.", "published": "2016-08-28 06:48:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07775v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "What to do about non-standard (or non-canonical) language in NLP", "abstract": "Real world data differs radically from the benchmark corpora we use in\nnatural language processing (NLP). As soon as we apply our technologies to the\nreal world, performance drops. The reason for this problem is obvious: NLP\nmodels are trained on samples from a limited set of canonical varieties that\nare considered standard, most prominently English newswire. However, there are\nmany dimensions, e.g., socio-demographics, language, genre, sentence type, etc.\non which texts can differ from the standard. The solution is not obvious: we\ncannot control for all factors, and it is not clear how to best go beyond the\ncurrent practice of training on homogeneous data from a single domain and\nlanguage.\n  In this paper, I review the notion of canonicity, and how it shapes our\ncommunity's approach to language. I argue for leveraging what I call fortuitous\ndata, i.e., non-obvious data that is hitherto neglected, hidden in plain sight,\nor raw data that needs to be refined. If we embrace the variety of this\nheterogeneous data by combining it with proper algorithms, we will not only\nproduce more robust models, but will also enable adaptive language technology\ncapable of addressing natural language variation.", "published": "2016-08-28 17:51:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07836v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Quantitative Analyses of Chinese Poetry of Tang and Song Dynasties:\n  Using Changing Colors and Innovative Terms as Examples", "abstract": "Tang (618-907 AD) and Song (960-1279) dynasties are two very important\nperiods in the development of Chinese literary. The most influential forms of\nthe poetry in Tang and Song were Shi and Ci, respectively. Tang Shi and Song Ci\nestablished crucial foundations of the Chinese literature, and their influences\nin both literary works and daily lives of the Chinese communities last until\ntoday.\n  We can analyze and compare the Complete Tang Shi and the Complete Song Ci\nfrom various viewpoints. In this presentation, we report our findings about the\ndifferences in their vocabularies. Interesting new words that started to appear\nin Song Ci and continue to be used in modern Chinese were identified. Colors\nare an important ingredient of the imagery in poetry, and we discuss the most\nfrequent color words that appeared in Tang Shi and Song Ci.", "published": "2016-08-28 20:31:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07852v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.DL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
