{"title": "BOFFIN TTS: Few-Shot Speaker Adaptation by Bayesian Optimization", "abstract": "We present BOFFIN TTS (Bayesian Optimization For FIne-tuning Neural Text To Speech), a novel approach for few-shot speaker adaptation. Here, the task is to fine-tune a pre-trained TTS model to mimic a new speaker using a small corpus of target utterances. We demonstrate that there does not exist a one-size-fits-all adaptation strategy, with convincing synthesis requiring a corpus-specific configuration of the hyper-parameters that control fine-tuning. By using Bayesian optimization to efficiently optimize these hyper-parameter values for a target speaker, we are able to perform adaptation with an average 30% improvement in speaker similarity over standard techniques. Results indicate, across multiple corpora, that BOFFIN TTS can learn to synthesize new speakers using less than ten minutes of audio, achieving the same naturalness as produced for the speakers used to train the base model.", "published": "2020-02-04 16:37:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01953v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Audio-Visual Calibration with Polynomial Regression for 2-D Projection Using SVD-PHAT", "abstract": "This paper proposes a straightforward 2-D method to spatially calibrate the visual field of a camera with the auditory field of an array microphone by generating and overlaying an acoustic image over an optical image. Using a low-cost microphone array and an off-the-shelf camera, we show that polynomial regression can deal efficiently with non-linear camera distortion, and that a recently proposed sound source localization method for real-time processing, SVD-PHAT, can be adapted for this task.", "published": "2020-02-04 18:00:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01440v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
