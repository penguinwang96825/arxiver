{"title": "Detection is the central problem in real-word spelling correction", "abstract": "Real-word spelling correction differs from non-word spelling correction in\nits aims and its challenges. Here we show that the central problem in real-word\nspelling correction is detection. Methods from non-word spelling correction,\nwhich focus instead on selection among candidate corrections, do not address\ndetection adequately, because detection is either assumed in advance or heavily\nconstrained. As we demonstrate in this paper, merely discriminating between the\nintended word and a random close variation of it within the context of a\nsentence is a task that can be performed with high accuracy using\nstraightforward models. Trigram models are sufficient in almost all cases. The\ndifficulty comes when every word in the sentence is a potential error, with a\nlarge set of possible candidate corrections. Despite their strengths, trigram\nmodels cannot reliably find true errors without introducing many more, at least\nnot when used in the obvious sequential way without added structure. The\ndetection task exposes weakness not visible in the selection task.", "published": "2014-08-13 22:09:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3153v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
