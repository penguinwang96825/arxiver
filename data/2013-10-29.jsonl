{"title": "Individual Biases, Cultural Evolution, and the Statistical Nature of\n  Language Universals: The Case of Colour Naming Systems", "abstract": "Language universals have long been attributed to an innate Universal Grammar.\nAn alternative explanation states that linguistic universals emerged\nindependently in every language in response to shared cognitive or perceptual\nbiases. A computational model has recently shown how this could be the case,\nfocusing on the paradigmatic example of the universal properties of colour\nnaming patterns, and producing results in quantitative agreement with the\nexperimental data. Here we investigate the role of an individual perceptual\nbias in the framework of the model. We study how, and to what extent, the\nstructure of the bias influences the corresponding linguistic universal\npatterns. We show that the cultural history of a group of speakers introduces\npopulation-specific constraints that act against the pressure for uniformity\narising from the individual bias, and we clarify the interplay between these\ntwo forces.", "published": "2013-10-29 12:29:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7782v2", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.MA", "q-bio.PE"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
