{"title": "Neural embeddings for metaphor detection in a corpus of Greek texts", "abstract": "One of the major challenges that NLP faces is metaphor detection, especially\nby automatic means, a task that becomes even more difficult for languages\nlacking in linguistic resources and tools. Our purpose is the automatic\ndifferentiation between literal and metaphorical meaning in authentic\nnon-annotated phrases from the Corpus of Greek Texts by means of computational\nmethods of machine learning. For this purpose the theoretical background of\ndistributional semantics is discussed and employed. Distributional Semantics\nTheory develops concepts and methods for the quantification and classification\nof semantic similarities displayed by linguistic elements in large amounts of\nlinguistic data according to their distributional properties. In accordance\nwith this model, the approach followed in the thesis takes into account the\nlinguistic context for the computation of the distributional representation of\nphrases in geometrical space, as well as for their comparison with the\ndistributional representations of other phrases, whose function in speech is\nalready \"known\" with the objective to reach conclusions about their literal or\nmetaphorical function in the specific linguistic context. This procedure aims\nat dealing with the lack of linguistic resources for the Greek language, as the\nalmost impossible up to now semantic comparison between \"phrases\", takes the\nform of an arithmetical comparison of their distributional representations in\ngeometrical space.", "published": "2019-02-10 19:46:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03659v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Neural Machine Translation for Cebuano to Tagalog with Subword Unit\n  Translation", "abstract": "The Philippines is an archipelago composed of 7, 641 different islands with\nmore than 150 different languages. This linguistic differences and diversity,\nthough may be seen as a beautiful feature, have contributed to the difficulty\nin the promotion of educational and cultural development of different domains\nin the country. An effective machine translation system solely dedicated to\ncater Philippine languages will surely help bridge this gap. In this research\nwork, a never before applied approach for language translation to a Philippine\nlanguage was used for a Cebuano to Tagalog translator. A Recurrent Neural\nNetwork was used to implement the translator using OpenNMT sequence modeling\ntool in TensorFlow. The performance of the translation was evaluated using the\nBLEU Score metric. For the Cebuano to Tagalog translation, BLEU produced a\nscore of 20.01. A subword unit translation for verbs and copyable approach was\nperformed where commonly seen mistranslated words from the source to the target\nwere corrected. The BLEU score increased to 22.87. Though slightly higher, this\nscore still indicates that the translation is somehow understandable but is not\nyet considered as a good translation.", "published": "2019-02-10 13:28:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07250v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Performance Advantages of Deep Neural Networks for Angle of Arrival\n  Estimation", "abstract": "The problem of estimating the number of sources and their angles of arrival\nfrom a single antenna array observation has been an active area of research in\nthe signal processing community for the last few decades. When the number of\nsources is large, the maximum likelihood estimator is intractable due to its\nvery high complexity, and therefore alternative signal processing methods have\nbeen developed with some performance loss. In this paper, we apply a deep\nneural network (DNN) approach to the problem and analyze its advantages with\nrespect to signal processing algorithms. We show that an appropriate designed\nnetwork can attain the maximum likelihood performance with feasible complexity\nand outperform other feasible signal processing estimation methods over various\nsignal to noise ratios and array response inaccuracies.", "published": "2019-02-10 10:33:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03569v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG", "cs.SD", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
