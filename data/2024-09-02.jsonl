{"title": "Irreversible investment under weighted discounting: effects of decreasing impatience", "abstract": "This paper employs an intra-personal game-theoretic framework to investigate\nhow decreasing impatience influences irreversible investment behaviors in a\ncontinuous-time setting. We consider a capacity expansion problem under\nweighted discount functions, a class of nonexponential functions that exhibit\ndecreasing impatience, including the hyperbolic discount function as a special\ncase. By deriving the Bellman system that characterizes the equilibrium, we\nestablish the framework for analyzing investment behaviors of agents subject to\ndecreasing impatience. From an economic perspective, we demonstrates that\ndecreasing impatience prompts early investment. From a technical standpoint, we\nwarn that decreasing impatience can lead to the failure of the smooth pasting\nprinciple.", "published": "2024-09-02 22:07:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01478v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "A Financial Time Series Denoiser Based on Diffusion Model", "abstract": "Financial time series often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio, posing\nsignificant challenges for accurate data interpretation and prediction and\nultimately decision making. Generative models have gained attention as powerful\ntools for simulating and predicting intricate data patterns, with the diffusion\nmodel emerging as a particularly effective method. This paper introduces a\nnovel approach utilizing the diffusion model as a denoiser for financial time\nseries in order to improve data predictability and trading performance. By\nleveraging the forward and reverse processes of the conditional diffusion model\nto add and remove noise progressively, we reconstruct original data from noisy\ninputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that diffusion model-based\ndenoised time series significantly enhance the performance on downstream future\nreturn classification tasks. Moreover, trading signals derived from the\ndenoised data yield more profitable trades with fewer transactions, thereby\nminimizing transaction costs and increasing overall trading efficiency.\nFinally, we show that by using classifiers trained on denoised time series, we\ncan recognize the noising state of the market and obtain excess return.", "published": "2024-09-02 15:55:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02138v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
