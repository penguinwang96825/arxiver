{"title": "Automatic Dialect Detection in Arabic Broadcast Speech", "abstract": "We investigate different approaches for dialect identification in Arabic\nbroadcast speech, using phonetic, lexical features obtained from a speech\nrecognition system, and acoustic features using the i-vector framework. We\nstudied both generative and discriminate classifiers, and we combined these\nfeatures using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). We validated our\nresults on an Arabic/English language identification task, with an accuracy of\n100%. We used these features in a binary classifier to discriminate between\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal Arabic, with an accuracy of 100%. We\nfurther report results using the proposed method to discriminate between the\nfive most widely used dialects of Arabic: namely Egyptian, Gulf, Levantine,\nNorth African, and MSA, with an accuracy of 52%. We discuss dialect\nidentification errors in the context of dialect code-switching between\nDialectal Arabic and MSA, and compare the error pattern between manually\nlabeled data, and the output from our classifier. We also release the train and\ntest data as standard corpus for dialect identification.", "published": "2015-09-23 11:41:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06928v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Fully automatic multi-language translation with a catalogue of phrases -\n  successful employment for the Swiss avalanche bulletin", "abstract": "The Swiss avalanche bulletin is produced twice a day in four languages. Due\nto the lack of time available for manual translation, a fully automated\ntranslation system is employed, based on a catalogue of predefined phrases and\npredetermined rules of how these phrases can be combined to produce sentences.\nBecause this catalogue of phrases is limited to a small sublanguage, the system\nis able to automatically translate such sentences from German into the target\nlanguages French, Italian and English without subsequent proofreading or\ncorrection. Having been operational for two winter seasons, we assess here the\nquality of the produced texts based on two different surveys where participants\nrated texts from real avalanche bulletins from both origins, the catalogue of\nphrases versus manually written and translated texts. With a mean recognition\nrate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between thetwo types of texts, and\ngive very similar ratings with respect to their language quality. Overall, the\noutput from the catalogue system can be considered virtually equivalent to a\ntext written by avalanche forecasters and then manually translated by\nprofessional translators. Furthermore, forecasters declared that all relevant\nsituations were captured by the system with sufficient accuracy. Forecaster's\nworking load did not change with the introduction of the catalogue: the extra\ntime to find matching sentences is compensated by the fact that they no longer\nneed to double-check manually translated texts. The reduction of daily\ntranslation costs is expected to offset the initial development costs within a\nfew years.", "published": "2015-09-23 12:09:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06937v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Exploration and Exploitation of Victorian Science in Darwin's Reading\n  Notebooks", "abstract": "Search in an environment with an uncertain distribution of resources involves\na trade-off between exploitation of past discoveries and further exploration.\nThis extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between\nreading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making\nprocess, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated\nscientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books\nlisted in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic\nmodels to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading\ndecisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated,\ninformation-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of\nsurprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's\nbehavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually\nhigh levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts,\ndetected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual\nepochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's\nown self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts\nwith their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory\nthan the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal\nchanges are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our\nquantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework\nfor testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between\nshort- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic\nmodeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of\ncollective scientific behavior.", "published": "2015-09-23 22:41:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07175v5", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CY", "cs.DL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
