{"title": "Generalization of metric classification algorithms for sequences\n  classification and labelling", "abstract": "The article deals with the issue of modification of metric classification\nalgorithms. In particular, it studies the algorithm k-Nearest Neighbours for\nits application to sequential data. A method of generalization of metric\nclassification algorithms is proposed. As a part of it, there has been\ndeveloped an algorithm for solving the problem of classification and labelling\nof sequential data. The advantages of the developed algorithm of classification\nin comparison with the existing one are also discussed in the article. There is\na comparison of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with the algorithm\nof CRF in the task of chunking in the open data set CoNLL2000.", "published": "2016-10-15 11:04:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04718v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
