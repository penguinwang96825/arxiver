{"title": "A Novel Architecture for Relevant Blog Page Identifcation", "abstract": "Blogs are undoubtedly the richest source of information available in\ncyberspace. Blogs can be of various natures i.e. personal blogs which contain\nposts on mixed issues or blogs can be domain specific which contains posts on\nparticular topics, this is the reason, they offer wide variety of relevant\ninformation which is often focused. A general search engine gives back a huge\ncollection of web pages which may or may not give correct answers, as web is\nthe repository of information of all kinds and a user has to go through various\ndocuments before he gets what he was originally looking for, which is a very\ntime consuming process. So, the search can be made more focused and accurate if\nit is limited to blogosphere instead of web pages. The reason being that the\nblogs are more focused in terms of information. So, User will only get related\nblogs in response to his query. These results will be then ranked according to\nour proposed method and are finally presented in front of user in descending\norder", "published": "2013-07-31 05:40:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8225v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
