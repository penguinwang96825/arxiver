{"title": "TBX goes TEI -- Implementing a TBX basic extension for the Text Encoding\n  Initiative guidelines", "abstract": "This paper presents an attempt to customise the TEI (Text Encoding\nInitiative) guidelines in order to offer the possibility to incorporate TBX\n(TermBase eXchange) based terminological entries within any kind of TEI\ndocuments. After presenting the general historical, conceptual and technical\ncontexts, we describe the various design choices we had to take while creating\nthis customisation, which in turn have led to make various changes in the\nactual TBX serialisation. Keeping in mind the objective to provide the TEI\nguidelines with, again, an onomasiological model, we try to identify the best\ncomprise in maintaining both the isomorphism with the existing TBX Basic\nstandard and the characteristics of the TEI framework.", "published": "2014-03-01 06:46:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0052v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
