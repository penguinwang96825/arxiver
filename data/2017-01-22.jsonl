{"title": "What the Language You Tweet Says About Your Occupation", "abstract": "Many aspects of people's lives are proven to be deeply connected to their\njobs. In this paper, we first investigate the distinct characteristics of major\noccupation categories based on tweets. From multiple social media platforms, we\ngather several types of user information. From users' LinkedIn webpages, we\nlearn their proficiencies. To overcome the ambiguity of self-reported\ninformation, a soft clustering approach is applied to extract occupations from\ncrowd-sourced data. Eight job categories are extracted, including Marketing,\nAdministrator, Start-up, Editor, Software Engineer, Public Relation, Office\nClerk, and Designer. Meanwhile, users' posts on Twitter provide cues for\nunderstanding their linguistic styles, interests, and personalities. Our\nresults suggest that people of different jobs have unique tendencies in certain\nlanguage styles and interests. Our results also clearly reveal distinctive\nlevels in terms of Big Five Traits for different jobs. Finally, a classifier is\nbuilt to predict job types based on the features extracted from tweets. A high\naccuracy indicates a strong discrimination power of language features for job\nprediction task.", "published": "2017-01-22 23:03:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06233v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
