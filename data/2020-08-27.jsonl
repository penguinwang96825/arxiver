{"title": "Optimal minimal-perturbation university timetabling with faculty preferences", "abstract": "In the university timetabling problem, sometimes additions or cancellations of course sections occur shortly before the beginning of the academic term, necessitating last-minute teaching staffing changes. We present a decision-making framework that both minimizes the number of course swaps, which are inconvenient to faculty members, and maximizes faculty members' preferences for times they wish to teach. The model is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). Numerical simulations for a hypothetical mid-sized academic department are presented.", "published": "2020-08-27 19:11:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12342v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Machine Learning and Computer Vision Techniques to Predict Thermal Properties of Particulate Composites", "abstract": "Accurate thermal analysis of composites and porous media requires detailed characterization of local thermal properties in small scale. For some important applications such as lithium-ion batteries, changes in the properties during the operation makes the analysis even more challenging, necessitating a rapid characterization. We propose a new method to characterize the thermal properties of particulate composites based on actual micro-images. Our computer-vision-based approach constructs 3D images from stacks of 2D SEM images and then extracts several representative elemental volumes (REVs) from the reconstructed images at random places, which leads to having a range of geometrical features for different REVs. A deep learning algorithm is designed based on convolutional neural nets to take the shape of the geometry and result in the effective conductivity of the REV. The training of the network is performed in two methods: First, based on implementing a coarser grid that uses the average values of conductivities from the fine grid and the resulted effective conductivity from the DNS solution of the fine grid. The other method uses conductivity values on cross sections from each REV in different directions. The results of training based on averaging show that using a coarser grid in the network does not have a meaningful effect on the network error; however, it decreases the training time up to three orders of magnitude. We showed that one general network can make accurate predictions using different types of electrode images, representing the difference in the geometry and constituents. Moreover, training based on averaging is more accurate than training based on cross sections. The study of the robustness of implementing a machine learning technique in predicting the thermal percolation shows the prediction error is almost half of the error from predictions based on the volume fraction.", "published": "2020-08-27 06:21:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01968v1", "categories": ["physics.app-ph", "cs.CV", "cs.LG", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "physics.app-ph"}
{"title": "End-to-end Music-mixed Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multimedia content is one of the promising applications, but speech data in this kind of content are frequently mixed with background music, which is harmful for the performance of ASR. In this study, we propose a method for improving ASR with background music based on time-domain source separation. We utilize Conv-TasNet as a separation network, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-speaker source separation, to extract the speech signal from a speech-music mixture in the waveform domain. We also propose joint fine-tuning of a pre-trained Conv-TasNet front-end with an attention-based ASR back-end using both separation and ASR objectives. We evaluated our method through ASR experiments using speech data mixed with background music from a wide variety of Japanese animations. We show that time-domain speech-music separation drastically improves ASR performance of the back-end model trained with mixture data, and the joint optimization yielded a further significant WER reduction. The time-domain separation method outperformed a frequency-domain separation method, which reuses the phase information of the input mixture signal, both in simple cascading and joint training settings. We also demonstrate that our method works robustly for music interference from classical, jazz and popular genres.", "published": "2020-08-27 10:51:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12048v1", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Dynamic Noise Embedding: Noise Aware Training and Adaptation for Speech Enhancement", "abstract": "Estimating noise information exactly is crucial for noise aware training in speech applications including speech enhancement (SE) which is our focus in this paper. To estimate noise-only frames, we employ voice activity detection (VAD) to detect non-speech frames by applying optimal threshold on speech posterior. Here, the non-speech frames can be regarded as noise-only frames in noisy signal. These estimated frames are used to extract noise embedding, named dynamic noise embedding (DNE), which is useful for an SE module to capture the characteristic of background noise. The DNE is extracted by a simple neural network, and the SE module with the DNE can be jointly trained to be adaptive to the environment. Experiments are conducted on TIMIT dataset for single-channel denoising task and U-Net is used as a backbone SE module. Experimental results show that the DNE plays an important role in the SE module by increasing the quality and the intelligibility of corrupted signal even if the noise is non-stationary and unseen in training. In addition, we demonstrate that the DNE can be flexibly applied to other neural network-based SE modules.", "published": "2020-08-27 05:45:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11920v2", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
