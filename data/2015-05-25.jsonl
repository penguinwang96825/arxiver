{"title": "Reply to Garcia et al.: Common mistakes in measuring frequency dependent\n  word characteristics", "abstract": "We demonstrate that the concerns expressed by Garcia et al. are misplaced,\ndue to (1) a misreading of our findings in [1]; (2) a widespread failure to\nexamine and present words in support of asserted summary quantities based on\nword usage frequencies; and (3) a range of misconceptions about word usage\nfrequency, word rank, and expert-constructed word lists. In particular, we show\nthat the English component of our study compares well statistically with two\nrelated surveys, that no survey design influence is apparent, and that\nestimates of measurement error do not explain the positivity biases reported in\nour work and that of others. We further demonstrate that for the frequency\ndependence of positivity---of which we explored the nuances in great detail in\n[1]---Garcia et al. did not perform a reanalysis of our data---they instead\ncarried out an analysis of a different, statistically improper data set and\nintroduced a nonlinearity before performing linear regression.", "published": "2015-05-25 20:33:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06750v2", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
