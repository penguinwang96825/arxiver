{"title": "Modeling Context in Referring Expressions", "abstract": "Humans refer to objects in their environments all the time, especially in\ndialogue with other people. We explore generating and comprehending natural\nlanguage referring expressions for objects in images. In particular, we focus\non incorporating better measures of visual context into referring expression\nmodels and find that visual comparison to other objects within an image helps\nimprove performance significantly. We also develop methods to tie the language\ngeneration process together, so that we generate expressions for all objects of\na particular category jointly. Evaluation on three recent datasets - RefCOCO,\nRefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, shows the advantages of our methods for both referring\nexpression generation and comprehension.", "published": "2016-07-31 22:21:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00272v3", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Continuation semantics for multi-quantifier sentences: operation-based\n  approaches", "abstract": "Classical scope-assignment strategies for multi-quantifier sentences involve\nquantifier phrase (QP)-movement. More recent continuation-based approaches\nprovide a compelling alternative, for they interpret QP's in situ - without\nresorting to Logical Forms or any structures beyond the overt syntax. The\ncontinuation-based strategies can be divided into two groups: those that locate\nthe source of scope-ambiguity in the rules of semantic composition and those\nthat attribute it to the lexical entries for the quantifier words. In this\npaper, we focus on the former operation-based approaches and the nature of the\nsemantic operations involved. More specifically, we discuss three such possible\noperation-based strategies for multi-quantifier sentences, together with their\nrelative merits and costs.", "published": "2016-07-31 20:01:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00255v2", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.CL", "cs.LO", "03B65, 91F20"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
