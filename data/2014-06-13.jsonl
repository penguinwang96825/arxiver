{"title": "Are Style Guides Controlled Languages? The Case of Koenig & Bauer AG", "abstract": "Controlled natural languages for industrial application are often regarded as\na response to the challenges of translation and multilingual communication.\nThis paper presents a quite different approach taken by Koenig & Bauer AG,\nwhere the main goal was the improvement of the authoring process for technical\ndocumentation. Most importantly, this paper explores the notion of a controlled\nlanguage and demonstrates how style guides can emerge from non-linguistic\nconsiderations. Moreover, it shows the transition from loose language\nrecommendations into precise and prescriptive rules and investigates whether\nsuch rules can be regarded as a full-fledged controlled language.", "published": "2014-06-13 09:23:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3460v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
