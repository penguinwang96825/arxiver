{"title": "Libri-Adapt: A New Speech Dataset for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new dataset, Libri-Adapt, to support unsupervised domain adaptation research on speech recognition models. Built on top of the LibriSpeech corpus, Libri-Adapt contains English speech recorded on mobile and embedded-scale microphones, and spans 72 different domains that are representative of the challenging practical scenarios encountered by ASR models. More specifically, Libri-Adapt facilitates the study of domain shifts in ASR models caused by a) different acoustic environments, b) variations in speaker accents, c) heterogeneity in the hardware and platform software of the microphones, and d) a combination of the aforementioned three shifts. We also provide a number of baseline results quantifying the impact of these domain shifts on the Mozilla DeepSpeech2 ASR model.", "published": "2020-09-06 20:47:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02814v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "A Comparison of Virtual Analog Modelling Techniques for Desktop and Embedded Implementations", "abstract": "We develop a virtual analog model of the Klon Centaur guitar pedal circuit, comparing various circuit modelling techniques. The techniques analyzed include traditional modelling techniques such as nodal analysis and Wave Digital Filters, as well as a machine learning technique using recurrent neural networks. We examine these techniques in the contexts of two use cases: an audio plug-in designed to be run on a consumer-grade desktop computer, and a guitar pedal-style effect running on an embedded device. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disdvantages of each technique for modelling different circuits, and targeting different platforms.", "published": "2020-09-06 23:56:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02833v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
