The parameters of the underlying Lorentzian states are obtained by fitting the data. Statistical properties of the states are discussed. This is a practical development of the general method introduced in arXiv:1203.6021.", "published": "2012-04-27 19:53:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5820v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
