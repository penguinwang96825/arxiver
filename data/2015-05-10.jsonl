{"title": "Fast Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Parsing", "abstract": "In recent years, There has been a variety of research on discourse parsing,\nparticularly RST discourse parsing. Most of the recent work on RST parsing has\nfocused on implementing new types of features or learning algorithms in order\nto improve accuracy, with relatively little focus on efficiency, robustness, or\npractical use. Also, most implementations are not widely available. Here, we\ndescribe an RST segmentation and parsing system that adapts models and feature\nsets from various previous work, as described below. Its accuracy is near\nstate-of-the-art, and it was developed to be fast, robust, and practical. For\nexample, it can process short documents such as news articles or essays in less\nthan a second.", "published": "2015-05-10 19:26:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02425v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Improved Relation Extraction with Feature-Rich Compositional Embedding\n  Models", "abstract": "Compositional embedding models build a representation (or embedding) for a\nlinguistic structure based on its component word embeddings. We propose a\nFeature-rich Compositional Embedding Model (FCM) for relation extraction that\nis expressive, generalizes to new domains, and is easy-to-implement. The key\nidea is to combine both (unlexicalized) hand-crafted features with learned word\nembeddings. The model is able to directly tackle the difficulties met by\ntraditional compositional embeddings models, such as handling arbitrary types\nof sentence annotations and utilizing global information for composition. We\ntest the proposed model on two relation extraction tasks, and demonstrate that\nour model outperforms both previous compositional models and traditional\nfeature rich models on the ACE 2005 relation extraction task, and the SemEval\n2010 relation classification task. The combination of our model and a\nlog-linear classifier with hand-crafted features gives state-of-the-art\nresults.", "published": "2015-05-10 18:47:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02419v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
