{"title": "Extraction of Salient Sentences from Labelled Documents", "abstract": "We present a hierarchical convolutional document model with an architecture\ndesigned to support introspection of the document structure. Using this model,\nwe show how to use visualisation techniques from the computer vision literature\nto identify and extract topic-relevant sentences.\n  We also introduce a new scalable evaluation technique for automatic sentence\nextraction systems that avoids the need for time consuming human annotation of\nvalidation data.", "published": "2014-12-21 17:38:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6815v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
