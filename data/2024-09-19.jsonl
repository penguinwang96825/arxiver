{"title": "Heat modulated affine stochastic volatility models for forward curve dynamics", "abstract": "We present a function-valued stochastic volatility model designed to capture\nthe continuous-time evolution of forward curves in fixed-income or commodity\nmarkets. The dynamics of the (logarithmic) forward curves are defined by a\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton-Musiela stochastic partial differential equation modulated\nby an instantaneous volatility process that describes the second-order moment\nstructure of forwards with different time-to-maturity. We propose to model the\noperator-valued instantaneous covariance by an affine process on the cone of\npositive trace-class operators with drift given by the Lyapunov operator of the\nLaplacian. The so defined infinite-rank stochastic volatility model is\nanalytically tractable due to its affine structure and allows to model maturity\nspecific risk and volatility clustering in forward markets. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a numerically feasible spectral Galerkin approximation of the\nassociated operator-valued generalized Riccati equations and study the\nrobustness of the model with respect to finite-rank approximations by providing\nexplicit error bounds on the approximation error.", "published": "2024-09-19 20:06:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13070v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Financial Stochastic Models Diffusion: From Risk-Neutral to Real-World Measure", "abstract": "This research presents a comprehensive framework for transitioning financial\ndiffusion models from the risk-neutral (RN) measure to the real-world (RW)\nmeasure, leveraging results from probability theory, specifically Girsanov's\ntheorem. The RN measure, fundamental in derivative pricing, is contrasted with\nthe RW measure, which incorporates risk premiums and better reflects actual\nmarket behavior and investor preferences, making it crucial for risk\nmanagement. We address the challenges of incorporating real-world dynamics into\nfinancial models, such as accounting for market premiums, producing realistic\nterm structures of market indicators, and fitting any arbitrarily given market\ncurve. Our framework is designed to be general, applicable to a variety of\ndiffusion models, including those with non-additive noise such as the CIR++\nmodel. Through case studies involving Goldman Sachs' 2024 global credit outlook\nforecasts and the European Banking Authority (EBA) 2023 stress tests, we\nvalidate the robustness, practical relevance and applicability of our\nmethodology. This work contributes to the literature by providing a versatile\ntool for better risk measures and enhancing the realism of financial models\nunder the RW measure. Our model's versatility extends to stress testing and\nscenario analysis, providing practitioners with a powerful tool to evaluate\nvarious what-if scenarios and make well-informed decisions, particularly in\npricing and risk management strategies.", "published": "2024-09-19 13:51:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12783v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "91G30, 91G70, 91G80, 60H10, 60G99", "G.3; I.6"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading Problems for Semi-Markov and Hawkes Jump-Diffusion Models", "abstract": "This paper introduces a jump-diffusion pricing model specifically designed\nfor algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading (HFT). The model\nincorporates independent jump and diffusion processes, providing a more precise\nrepresentation of the limit order book (LOB) dynamics within a scaling-limit\nframework. Given that algorithmic and HFT strategies now dominate major\nfinancial markets, accurately modeling LOB dynamics is crucial for developing\neffective trading algorithms. Recent research has shown that LOB data often\nexhibit non-Markovian properties, reinforcing the need for models that better\ncapture its evolution. In this paper, we address acquisition and liquidation\nproblems under more general compound semi-Markov and Hawkes jump-diffusion\nmodels. We first develop jump-diffusion frameworks to capture these dynamics\nand then apply diffusion approximations to the jump components so that robust\nsolutions can be given. Optimal trading strategies are formulated using\nstochastic optimal control (SOC) and solved numerically. Finally, we present\nstrategy simulations analyzing price paths, inventory evolution, trading speed,\nand average execution prices. This study provides insights into how these\nmodels can improve execution strategies under more general price dynamics.", "published": "2024-09-19 13:44:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12776v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}

{"title": "A Multi-agent Market Model Can Explain the Impact of AI Traders in Financial Markets -- A New Microfoundations of GARCH model", "abstract": "The AI traders in financial markets have sparked significant interest in\ntheir effects on price formation mechanisms and market volatility, raising\nimportant questions for market stability and regulation. Despite this interest,\na comprehensive model to quantitatively assess the specific impacts of AI\ntraders remains undeveloped. This study aims to address this gap by modeling\nthe influence of AI traders on market price formation and volatility within a\nmulti-agent framework, leveraging the concept of microfoundations.\nMicrofoundations involve understanding macroeconomic phenomena, such as market\nprice formation, through the decision-making and interactions of individual\neconomic agents. While widely acknowledged in macroeconomics, microfoundational\napproaches remain unexplored in empirical finance, particularly for models like\nthe GARCH model, which captures key financial statistical properties such as\nvolatility clustering and fat tails. This study proposes a multi-agent market\nmodel to derive the microfoundations of the GARCH model, incorporating three\ntypes of agents: noise traders, fundamental traders, and AI traders. By\nmathematically aggregating the micro-structure of these agents, we establish\nthe microfoundations of the GARCH model. We validate this model through\nmulti-agent simulations, confirming its ability to reproduce the stylized facts\nof financial markets. Finally, we analyze the impact of AI traders using\nparameters derived from these microfoundations, contributing to a deeper\nunderstanding of their role in market dynamics.", "published": "2024-09-19 07:14:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12516v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.MA", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
