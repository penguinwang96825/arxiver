{"title": "Description and Evaluation of Semantic Similarity Measures Approaches", "abstract": "In recent years, semantic similarity measure has a great interest in Semantic\nWeb and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Several similarity measures have\nbeen developed, being given the existence of a structured knowledge\nrepresentation offered by ontologies and corpus which enable semantic\ninterpretation of terms. Semantic similarity measures compute the similarity\nbetween concepts/terms included in knowledge sources in order to perform\nestimations. This paper discusses the existing semantic similarity methods\nbased on structure, information content and feature approaches. Additionally,\nwe present a critical evaluation of several categories of semantic similarity\napproaches based on two standard benchmarks. The aim of this paper is to give\nan efficient evaluation of all these measures which help researcher and\npractitioners to select the measure that best fit for their requirements.", "published": "2013-10-30 08:08:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8059v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
