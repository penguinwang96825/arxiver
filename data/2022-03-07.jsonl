{"title": "Robust Design of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access With Imperfect CSI for Cell-Free MIMO Systems", "abstract": "Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) for multi-user downlink operates by splitting the message for each user equipment (UE) into a private message and a set of common messages, which are simultaneously transmitted by means of superposition coding. The RSMA scheme can enhance throughput and connectivity as compared to conventional multiple access techniques by optimizing the rate-splitting ratios along with the corresponding downlink beamforming vectors. This work examines the impact of erroneous channel state information (CSI) on the performance of RSMA in cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. An efficient robust optimization algorithm is proposed by using closed-form lower bound expressions on the expected data rates. Extensive numerical results show the importance of robust design in the presence of CSI errors and how the performance gain of RSMA over conventional schemes is affected by CSI imperfection.", "published": "2022-03-07 20:19:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03690v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Detecting data-driven robust statistical arbitrage strategies with deep neural networks", "abstract": "We present an approach, based on deep neural networks, that allows identifying robust statistical arbitrage strategies in financial markets. Robust statistical arbitrage strategies refer to trading strategies that enable profitable trading under model ambiguity. The presented novel methodology allows to consider a large amount of underlying securities simultaneously and does not depend on the identification of cointegrated pairs of assets, hence it is applicable on high-dimensional financial markets or in markets where classical pairs trading approaches fail. Moreover, we provide a method to build an ambiguity set of admissible probability measures that can be derived from observed market data. Thus, the approach can be considered as being model-free and entirely data-driven. We showcase the applicability of our method by providing empirical investigations with highly profitable trading performances even in 50 dimensions, during financial crises, and when the cointegration relationship between asset pairs stops to persist.", "published": "2022-03-07 07:23:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03179v4", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
