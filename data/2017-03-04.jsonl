{"title": "Lexical Resources for Hindi Marathi MT", "abstract": "In this paper we describe some ways to utilize various lexical resources to\nimprove the quality of statistical machine translation system. We have\naugmented the training corpus with various lexical resources such as\nIndoWordnet semantic relation set, function words, kridanta pairs and verb\nphrases etc. Our research on the usage of lexical resources mainly focused on\ntwo ways such as augmenting parallel corpus with more vocabulary and augmenting\nwith various word forms. We have described case studies, evaluations and\ndetailed error analysis for both Marathi to Hindi and Hindi to Marathi machine\ntranslation systems. From the evaluations we observed that, there is an\nincremental growth in the quality of machine translation as the usage of\nvarious lexical resources increases. Moreover usage of various lexical\nresources helps to improve the coverage and quality of machine translation\nwhere limited parallel corpus is available.", "published": "2017-03-04 15:55:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01485v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
