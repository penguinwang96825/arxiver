{"title": "Brazilian listed options with discrete dividends and the fast Laplace transform", "abstract": "The Brazilian stock exchange (B3) has long used a strike-only adjustment to account for dividends in its listed equity options. This adjustment still makes it necessary to account for discrete dividends when pricing either calls or puts. This work presents a numerical procedure, based on the fast Laplace transform and its inverse, a procedure that can efficiently compute the Brazilian listed options' premium and the Greeks delta, gamma, and theta with high accuracy.", "published": "2022-12-02 17:22:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01315v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
