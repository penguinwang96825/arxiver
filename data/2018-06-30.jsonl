{"title": "chemmodlab: A Cheminformatics Modeling Laboratory for Fitting and Assessing Machine Learning Models", "abstract": "The goal of chemmodlab is to streamline the fitting and assessment pipeline for many machine learning models in R, making it easy for researchers to compare the utility of new models. While focused on implementing methods for model fitting and assessment that have been accepted by experts in the cheminformatics field, all of the methods in chemmodlab have broad utility for the machine learning community. chemmodlab contains several assessment utilities including a plotting function that constructs accumulation curves and a function that computes many performance measures. The most novel feature of chemmodlab is the ease with which statistically significant performance differences for many machine learning models is presented by means of the multiple comparisons similarity plot. Differences are assessed using repeated k-fold cross validation where blocking increases precision and multiplicity adjustments are applied.", "published": "2018-06-30 23:17:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00243v3", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "q-bio.QM"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Probabilistic Bisection with Spatial Metamodels", "abstract": "Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm performs root finding based on knowledge acquired from noisy oracle responses. We consider the generalized PBA setting (G-PBA) where the statistical distribution of the oracle is unknown and location-dependent, so that model inference and Bayesian knowledge updating must be performed simultaneously. To this end, we propose to leverage the spatial structure of a typical oracle by constructing a statistical surrogate for the underlying logistic regression step. We investigate several non-parametric surrogates, including Binomial Gaussian Processes (B-GP), Polynomial, Kernel, and Spline Logistic Regression. In parallel, we develop sampling policies that adaptively balance learning the oracle distribution and learning the root. One of our proposals mimics active learning with B-GPs and provides a novel look-ahead predictive variance formula. The resulting gains of our Spatial PBA algorithm relative to earlier G-PBA models are illustrated with synthetic examples and a challenging stochastic root finding problem from Bermudan option pricing.", "published": "2018-06-30 00:33:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00095v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
