{"title": "Generating Titles for Web Tables", "abstract": "Descriptive titles provide crucial context for interpreting tables that are\nextracted from web pages and are a key component of table-based web\napplications. Prior approaches have attempted to produce titles by selecting\nexisting text snippets associated with the table. These approaches, however,\nare limited by their dependence on suitable titles existing a priori. In our\nuser study, we observe that the relevant information for the title tends to be\nscattered across the page, and often--more than 80% of the time--does not\nappear verbatim anywhere in the page. We propose instead the application of a\nsequence-to-sequence neural network model as a more generalizable means of\ngenerating high-quality titles. This is accomplished by extracting many text\nsnippets that have potentially relevant information to the table, encoding them\ninto an input sequence, and using both copy and generation mechanisms in the\ndecoder to balance relevance and readability of the generated title. We\nvalidate this approach with human evaluation on sample web tables and report\nthat while sequence models with only a copy mechanism or only a generation\nmechanism are easily outperformed by simple selection-based baselines, the\nmodel with both capabilities outperforms them all, approaching the quality of\ncrowdsourced titles while training on fewer than ten thousand examples. To the\nbest of our knowledge, the proposed technique is the first to consider text\ngeneration methods for table titles and establishes a new state of the art.", "published": "2018-06-30 00:57:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00099v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization for Learning\n  Time-evolving and Emerging Topics", "abstract": "Topic discovery has witnessed a significant growth as a field of data mining\nat large. In particular, time-evolving topic discovery, where the evolution of\na topic is taken into account has been instrumental in understanding the\nhistorical context of an emerging topic in a dynamic corpus. Traditionally,\ntime-evolving topic discovery has focused on this notion of time. However,\nespecially in settings where content is contributed by a community or a crowd,\nan orthogonal notion of time is the one that pertains to the level of expertise\nof the content creator: the more experienced the creator, the more advanced the\ntopic. In this paper, we propose a novel time-evolving topic discovery method\nwhich, in addition to the extracted topics, is able to identify the evolution\nof that topic over time, as well as the level of difficulty of that topic, as\nit is inferred by the level of expertise of its main contributors. Our method\nis based on a novel formulation of Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor\nFactorization, which adopts constraints well-motivated for, and, as we\ndemonstrate, are essential for high-quality topic discovery. We qualitatively\nevaluate our approach using real data from the Physics and also Programming\nStack Exchange forum, and we were able to identify topics of varying levels of\ndifficulty which can be linked to external events, such as the announcement of\ngravitational waves by the LIGO lab in Physics forum. We provide a quantitative\nevaluation of our method by conducting a user study where experts were asked to\njudge the coherence and quality of the extracted topics. Finally, our proposed\nmethod has implications for automatic curriculum design using the extracted\ntopics, where the notion of the level of difficulty is necessary for the proper\nmodeling of prerequisites and advanced concepts.", "published": "2018-06-30 04:07:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00122v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "The Historical Significance of Textual Distances", "abstract": "Measuring similarity is a basic task in information retrieval, and now often\na building-block for more complex arguments about cultural change. But do\nmeasures of textual similarity and distance really correspond to evidence about\ncultural proximity and differentiation? To explore that question empirically,\nthis paper compares textual and social measures of the similarities between\ngenres of English-language fiction. Existing measures of textual similarity\n(cosine similarity on tf-idf vectors or topic vectors) are also compared to new\nstrategies that use supervised learning to anchor textual measurement in a\nsocial context.", "published": "2018-06-30 14:06:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00181v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Sound Event Localization and Detection of Overlapping Sources Using\n  Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network for joint\nsound event localization and detection (SELD) of multiple overlapping sound\nevents in three-dimensional (3D) space. The proposed network takes a sequence\nof consecutive spectrogram time-frames as input and maps it to two outputs in\nparallel. As the first output, the sound event detection (SED) is performed as\na multi-label classification task on each time-frame producing temporal\nactivity for all the sound event classes. As the second output, localization is\nperformed by estimating the 3D Cartesian coordinates of the\ndirection-of-arrival (DOA) for each sound event class using multi-output\nregression. The proposed method is able to associate multiple DOAs with\nrespective sound event labels and further track this association with respect\nto time. The proposed method uses separately the phase and magnitude component\nof the spectrogram calculated on each audio channel as the feature, thereby\navoiding any method- and array-specific feature extraction. The method is\nevaluated on five Ambisonic and two circular array format datasets with\ndifferent overlapping sound events in anechoic, reverberant and real-life\nscenarios. The proposed method is compared with two SED, three DOA estimation,\nand one SELD baselines. The results show that the proposed method is generic\nand applicable to any array structures, robust to unseen DOA values,\nreverberation, and low SNR scenarios. The proposed method achieved a\nconsistently higher recall of the estimated number of DOAs across datasets in\ncomparison to the best baseline. Additionally, this recall was observed to be\nsignificantly better than the best baseline method for a higher number of\noverlapping sound events.", "published": "2018-06-30 06:05:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00129v3", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
