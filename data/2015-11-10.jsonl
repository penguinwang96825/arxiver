{"title": "Investigating the stylistic relevance of adjective and verb simile\n  markers", "abstract": "Similes play an important role in literary texts not only as rhetorical\ndevices and as figures of speech but also because of their evocative power,\ntheir aptness for description and the relative ease with which they can be\ncombined with other figures of speech (Israel et al. 2004). Detecting all types\nof simile constructions in a particular text therefore seems crucial when\nanalysing the style of an author. Few research studies however have been\ndedicated to the study of less prominent simile markers in fictional prose and\ntheir relevance for stylistic studies. The present paper studies the frequency\nof adjective and verb simile markers in a corpus of British and French novels\nin order to determine which ones are really informative and worth including in\na stylistic analysis. Furthermore, are those adjectives and verb simile markers\nused differently in both languages?", "published": "2015-11-10 10:33:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03053v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "USFD: Twitter NER with Drift Compensation and Linked Data", "abstract": "This paper describes a pilot NER system for Twitter, comprising the USFD\nsystem entry to the W-NUT 2015 NER shared task. The goal is to correctly label\nentities in a tweet dataset, using an inventory of ten types. We employ\nstructured learning, drawing on gazetteers taken from Linked Data, and on\nunsupervised clustering features, and attempting to compensate for stylistic\nand topic drift - a key challenge in social media text. Our result is\ncompetitive; we provide an analysis of the components of our methodology, and\nan examination of the target dataset in the context of this task.", "published": "2015-11-10 12:34:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03088v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Information retrieval in folktales using natural language processing", "abstract": "Our aim is to extract information about literary characters in unstructured\ntexts. We employ natural language processing and reasoning on domain\nontologies. The first task is to identify the main characters and the parts of\nthe story where these characters are described or act. We illustrate the system\nin a scenario in the folktale domain. The system relies on a folktale ontology\nthat we have developed based on Propp's model for folktales morphology.", "published": "2015-11-10 08:13:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03012v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "From Images to Sentences through Scene Description Graphs using\n  Commonsense Reasoning and Knowledge", "abstract": "In this paper we propose the construction of linguistic descriptions of\nimages. This is achieved through the extraction of scene description graphs\n(SDGs) from visual scenes using an automatically constructed knowledge base.\nSDGs are constructed using both vision and reasoning. Specifically, commonsense\nreasoning is applied on (a) detections obtained from existing perception\nmethods on given images, (b) a \"commonsense\" knowledge base constructed using\nnatural language processing of image annotations and (c) lexical ontological\nknowledge from resources such as WordNet. Amazon Mechanical Turk(AMT)-based\nevaluations on Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets show that in most\ncases, sentences auto-constructed from SDGs obtained by our method give a more\nrelevant and thorough description of an image than a recent state-of-the-art\nimage caption based approach. Our Image-Sentence Alignment Evaluation results\nare also comparable to that of the recent state-of-the art approaches.", "published": "2015-11-10 21:14:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03292v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "I.2.10"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
