{"title": "WebSets: Extracting Sets of Entities from the Web Using Unsupervised\n  Information Extraction", "abstract": "We describe a open-domain information extraction method for extracting\nconcept-instance pairs from an HTML corpus. Most earlier approaches to this\nproblem rely on combining clusters of distributionally similar terms and\nconcept-instance pairs obtained with Hearst patterns. In contrast, our method\nrelies on a novel approach for clustering terms found in HTML tables, and then\nassigning concept names to these clusters using Hearst patterns. The method can\nbe efficiently applied to a large corpus, and experimental results on several\ndatasets show that our method can accurately extract large numbers of\nconcept-instance pairs.", "published": "2013-07-01 02:49:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0261v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
