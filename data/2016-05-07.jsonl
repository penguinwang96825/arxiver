{"title": "Neural Recovery Machine for Chinese Dropped Pronoun", "abstract": "Dropped pronouns (DPs) are ubiquitous in pro-drop languages like Chinese,\nJapanese etc. Previous work mainly focused on painstakingly exploring the\nempirical features for DPs recovery. In this paper, we propose a neural\nrecovery machine (NRM) to model and recover DPs in Chinese, so that to avoid\nthe non-trivial feature engineering process. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed NRM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on\nboth two heterogeneous datasets. Further experiment results of Chinese zero\npronoun (ZP) resolution show that the performance of ZP resolution can also be\nimproved by recovering the ZPs to DPs.", "published": "2016-05-07 02:41:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02134v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "On Improving Informativity and Grammaticality for Multi-Sentence\n  Compression", "abstract": "Multi Sentence Compression (MSC) is of great value to many real world\napplications, such as guided microblog summarization, opinion summarization and\nnewswire summarization. Recently, word graph-based approaches have been\nproposed and become popular in MSC. Their key assumption is that redundancy\namong a set of related sentences provides a reliable way to generate\ninformative and grammatical sentences. In this paper, we propose an effective\napproach to enhance the word graph-based MSC and tackle the issue that most of\nthe state-of-the-art MSC approaches are confronted with: i.e., improving both\ninformativity and grammaticality at the same time. Our approach consists of\nthree main components: (1) a merging method based on Multiword Expressions\n(MWE); (2) a mapping strategy based on synonymy between words; (3) a re-ranking\nstep to identify the best compression candidates generated using a POS-based\nlanguage model (POS-LM). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel\napproach using a dataset made of clusters of English newswire sentences. The\nobserved improvements on informativity and grammaticality of the generated\ncompressions show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art MSC\nmethods.", "published": "2016-05-07 06:39:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02150v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Robust Dialog State Tracking for Large Ontologies", "abstract": "The Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 (DSTC 4) differentiates itself from the\nprevious three editions as follows: the number of slot-value pairs present in\nthe ontology is much larger, no spoken language understanding output is given,\nand utterances are labeled at the subdialog level. This paper describes a novel\ndialog state tracking method designed to work robustly under these conditions,\nusing elaborate string matching, coreference resolution tailored for dialogs\nand a few other improvements. The method can correctly identify many values\nthat are not explicitly present in the utterance. On the final evaluation, our\nmethod came in first among 7 competing teams and 24 entries. The F1-score\nachieved by our method was 9 and 7 percentage points higher than that of the\nrunner-up for the utterance-level evaluation and for the subdialog-level\nevaluation, respectively.", "published": "2016-05-07 02:00:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02130v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
