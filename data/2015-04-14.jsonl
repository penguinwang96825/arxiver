{"title": "A data-based classification of Slavic languages: Indices of qualitative\n  variation applied to grapheme frequencies", "abstract": "The Ord's graph is a simple graphical method for displaying frequency\ndistributions of data or theoretical distributions in the two-dimensional\nplane. Its coordinates are proportions of the first three moments, either\nempirical or theoretical ones. A modification of the Ord's graph based on\nproportions of indices of qualitative variation is presented. Such a\nmodification makes the graph applicable also to data of categorical character.\nIn addition, the indices are normalized with values between 0 and 1, which\nenables comparing data files divided into different numbers of categories. Both\nthe original and the new graph are used to display grapheme frequencies in\neleven Slavic languages. As the original Ord's graph requires an assignment of\nnumbers to the categories, graphemes were ordered decreasingly according to\ntheir frequencies. Data were taken from parallel corpora, i.e., we work with\ngrapheme frequencies from a Russian novel and its translations to ten other\nSlavic languages. Then, cluster analysis is applied to the graph coordinates.\nWhile the original graph yields results which are not linguistically\ninterpretable, the modification reveals meaningful relations among the\nlanguages.", "published": "2015-04-14 16:23:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03608v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
{"title": "Temporal ordering of clinical events", "abstract": "This report describes a minimalistic set of methods engineered to anchor\nclinical events onto a temporal space. Specifically, we describe methods to\nextract clinical events (e.g., Problems, Treatments and Tests), temporal\nexpressions (i.e., time, date, duration, and frequency), and temporal links\n(e.g., Before, After, Overlap) between events and temporal entities. These\nmethods are developed and validated using high quality datasets.", "published": "2015-04-14 18:48:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03659v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Automated Analysis and Prediction of Job Interview Performance", "abstract": "We present a computational framework for automatically quantifying verbal and\nnonverbal behaviors in the context of job interviews. The proposed framework is\ntrained by analyzing the videos of 138 interview sessions with 69\ninternship-seeking undergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n(MIT). Our automated analysis includes facial expressions (e.g., smiles, head\ngestures, facial tracking points), language (e.g., word counts, topic\nmodeling), and prosodic information (e.g., pitch, intonation, and pauses) of\nthe interviewees. The ground truth labels are derived by taking a weighted\naverage over the ratings of 9 independent judges. Our framework can\nautomatically predict the ratings for interview traits such as excitement,\nfriendliness, and engagement with correlation coefficients of 0.75 or higher,\nand can quantify the relative importance of prosody, language, and facial\nexpressions. By analyzing the relative feature weights learned by the\nregression models, our framework recommends to speak more fluently, use less\nfiller words, speak as \"we\" (vs. \"I\"), use more unique words, and smile more.\nWe also find that the students who were rated highly while answering the first\ninterview question were also rated highly overall (i.e., first impression\nmatters). Finally, our MIT Interview dataset will be made available to other\nresearchers to further validate and expand our findings.", "published": "2015-04-14 05:49:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03425v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
