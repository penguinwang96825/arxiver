{"title": "Computational Sociolinguistics: A Survey", "abstract": "Language is a social phenomenon and variation is inherent to its social\nnature. Recently, there has been a surge of interest within the computational\nlinguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article\nwe present a survey of the emerging field of \"Computational Sociolinguistics\"\nthat reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive\noverview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the\nrelation between language and social identity, language use in social\ninteraction and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the\npotential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how\nthe large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement\nexisting sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and\nchallenge the methods and assumptions employed in CL studies. We hope to convey\nthe possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and\nconclude with a discussion of open challenges.", "published": "2015-08-30 08:39:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07544v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An Event Network for Exploring Open Information", "abstract": "In this paper, an event network is presented for exploring open information,\nwhere linguistic units about an event are organized for analysing. The process\nis divided into three steps: document event detection, event network\nconstruction and event network analysis. First, by implementing event detection\nor tracking, documents are retrospectively (or on-line) organized into document\nevents. Secondly, for each of the document event, linguistic units are\nextracted and combined into event networks. Thirdly, various analytic methods\nare proposed for event network analysis. In our application methodologies are\npresented for exploring open information.", "published": "2015-08-30 11:22:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07555v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
