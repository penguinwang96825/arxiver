{"title": "Persistent Topology of Syntax", "abstract": "We study the persistent homology of the data set of syntactic parameters of\nthe world languages. We show that, while homology generators behave erratically\nover the whole data set, non-trivial persistent homology appears when one\nrestricts to specific language families. Different families exhibit different\npersistent homology. We focus on the cases of the Indo-European and the\nNiger-Congo families, for which we compare persistent homology over different\ncluster filtering values. We investigate the possible significance, in\nhistorical linguistic terms, of the presence of persistent generators of the\nfirst homology. In particular, we show that the persistent first homology\ngenerator we find in the Indo-European family is not due (as one might guess)\nto the Anglo-Norman bridge in the Indo-European phylogenetic network, but is\nrelated to the position of Ancient Greek and the Hellenic branch within the\nnetwork.", "published": "2015-07-18 00:07:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05134v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.AT", "91F20"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
