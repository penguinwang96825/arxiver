{"title": "$2$-Layer $k$-Planar Graphs: Density, Crossing Lemma, Relationships, and Pathwidth", "abstract": "The $2$-layer drawing model is a well-established paradigm to visualize bipartite graphs. Several beyond-planar graph classes have been studied under this model. Surprisingly, however, the fundamental class of $k$-planar graphs has been considered only for $k=1$ in this context. We provide several contributions that address this gap in the literature. First, we show tight density bounds for the classes of $2$-layer $k$-planar graphs with $k\\in\\{2,3,4,5\\}$. Based on these results, we provide a Crossing Lemma for $2$-layer $k$-planar graphs, which then implies a general density bound for $2$-layer $k$-planar graphs. We prove this bound to be almost optimal with a corresponding lower bound construction. Finally, we study relationships between $k$-planarity and $h$-quasiplanarity in the $2$-layer model and show that $2$-layer $k$-planar graphs have pathwidth at most $k+1$.", "published": "2020-08-21 06:43:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09329v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CG", "cs.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Offline Contextual Multi-armed Bandits for Mobile Health Interventions: A Case Study on Emotion Regulation", "abstract": "Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people. We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.", "published": "2020-08-21 13:41:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09472v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.HC", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "The Connection Between Popularity Bias, Calibration, and Fairness in Recommendation", "abstract": "Recently there has been a growing interest in fairness-aware recommender systems including fairness in providing consistent performance across different users or groups of users. A recommender system could be considered unfair if the recommendations do not fairly represent the tastes of a certain group of users while other groups receive recommendations that are consistent with their preferences. In this paper, we use a metric called miscalibration for measuring how a recommendation algorithm is responsive to users' true preferences and we consider how various algorithms may result in different degrees of miscalibration for different users. In particular, we conjecture that popularity bias which is a well-known phenomenon in recommendation is one important factor leading to miscalibration in recommendation. Our experimental results using two real-world datasets show that there is a connection between how different user groups are affected by algorithmic popularity bias and their level of interest in popular items. Moreover, we show that the more a group is affected by the algorithmic popularity bias, the more their recommendations are miscalibrated.", "published": "2020-08-21 02:33:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09273v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "COOKIE: A Dataset for Conversational Recommendation over Knowledge Graphs in E-commerce", "abstract": "In this work, we present a new dataset for conversational recommendation over knowledge graphs in e-commerce platforms called COOKIE. The dataset is constructed from an Amazon review corpus by integrating both user-agent dialogue and custom knowledge graphs for recommendation. Specifically, we first construct a unified knowledge graph and extract key entities between user--product pairs, which serve as the skeleton of a conversation. Then we simulate conversations mirroring the human coarse-to-fine process of choosing preferred items. The proposed baselines and experiments demonstrate that our dataset is able to provide innovative opportunities for conversational recommendation.", "published": "2020-08-21 00:11:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09237v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "The Smart Mask: Active Closed-Loop Protection against Airborne Pathogens", "abstract": "Face masks provide effective, easy-to-use, and low-cost protection against airborne pathogens or infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2. There is a wide variety of face masks available on the market for various applications, but they are all passive in nature, i.e., simply act as air filters for the nasal passage and/or mouth. In this paper, we present a new \"active mask\" paradigm, in which the wearable device is equipped with smart sensors and actuators to both detect the presence of airborne pathogens in real time and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat. The proposed approach is based on a closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes close to the mask and then makes intelligent decisions to reduce their concentrations. This paper presents a specific implementation of this concept in which the on-board controller determines ambient air quality via a commercial particulate matter sensor, and if necessary activates a piezoelectric actuator that generates a mist spray to load these particles, thus causing them to fall to the ground. The proposed system communicates with the user via a smart phone application that provides various alerts, including notification of the need to recharge and/or decontaminate the mask prior to reuse. The application also enables a user to override the on-board control system and manually control the mist generator if necessary. Experimental results from a functional prototype demonstrate significant reduction in airborne particulate counts near the mask when the active protection system is enabled.", "published": "2020-08-21 00:07:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10420v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
