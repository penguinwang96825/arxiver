{"title": "Note on simulation pricing of $\u03c0$-options", "abstract": "In this work, we adapt a Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by Broadie and Glasserman (1997) to price a $\u03c0$-option. This method is based on the simulated price tree that comes from discretization and replication of possible trajectories of the underlying asset's price. As a result this algorithm produces the lower and the upper bounds that converge to the true price with the increasing depth of the tree. Under specific parametrization, this $\u03c0$-option is related to relative maximum drawdown and can be used in the real-market environment to protect a portfolio against volatile and unexpected price drops. We also provide some numerical analysis.", "published": "2020-07-04 11:38:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02076v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
