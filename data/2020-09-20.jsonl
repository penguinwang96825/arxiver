{"title": "Longformer for MS MARCO Document Re-ranking Task", "abstract": "Two step document ranking, where the initial retrieval is done by a classical information retrieval method, followed by neural re-ranking model, is the new standard. The best performance is achieved by using transformer-based models as re-rankers, e.g., BERT. We employ Longformer, a BERT-like model for long documents, on the MS MARCO document re-ranking task. The complete code used for training the model can be found on: https://github.com/isekulic/longformer-marco", "published": "2020-09-20 09:22:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09392v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Accelerating Auxiliary Function-based Independent Vector Analysis", "abstract": "Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) is an effective approach for Blind Source Separation (BSS) of convolutive mixtures of audio signals. As a practical realization of an IVA-based BSS algorithm, the so-called AuxIVA update rules based on the Majorize-Minimize (MM) principle have been proposed which allow for fast and computationally efficient optimization of the IVA cost function. For many real-time applications, however, update rules for IVA exhibiting even faster convergence are highly desirable. To this end, we investigate techniques which accelerate the convergence of the AuxIVA update rules without extra computational cost. The efficacy of the proposed methods is verified in experiments representing real-world acoustic scenarios.", "published": "2020-09-20 10:16:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09402v1", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
