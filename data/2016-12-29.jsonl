{"title": "Deep Semi-Supervised Learning with Linguistically Motivated Sequence\n  Labeling Task Hierarchies", "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel Neural Network algorithm for conducting\nsemi-supervised learning for sequence labeling tasks arranged in a\nlinguistically motivated hierarchy. This relationship is exploited to\nregularise the representations of supervised tasks by backpropagating the error\nof the unsupervised task through the supervised tasks. We introduce a neural\nnetwork where lower layers are supervised by junior downstream tasks and the\nfinal layer task is an auxiliary unsupervised task. The architecture shows\nimprovements of up to two percentage points F1 for Chunking compared to a\nplausible baseline.", "published": "2016-12-29 12:01:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09113v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Verifying Heaps' law using Google Books Ngram data", "abstract": "This article is devoted to the verification of the empirical Heaps law in\nEuropean languages using Google Books Ngram corpus data. The connection between\nword distribution frequency and expected dependence of individual word number\non text size is analysed in terms of a simple probability model of text\ngeneration. It is shown that the Heaps exponent varies significantly within\ncharacteristic time intervals of 60-100 years.", "published": "2016-12-29 17:36:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09213v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph", "91F20", "J.5; I.2.7; G.3"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
