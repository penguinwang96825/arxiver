{"title": "On Computing the Multiplicity of Cycles in Bipartite Graphs Using the Degree Distribution and the Spectrum of the Graph", "abstract": "Counting short cycles in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem of interest in the analysis and design of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The vast majority of research in this area is focused on algorithmic techniques. Most recently, Blake and Lin proposed a computational technique to count the number of cycles of length $g$ in a bi-regular bipartite graph, where $g$ is the girth of the graph. The information required for the computation is the node degree and the multiplicity of the nodes on both sides of the partition, as well as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph (graph spectrum). In this paper, the result of Blake and Lin is extended to compute the number of cycles of length $g+2, \\ldots, 2g-2$, for bi-regular bipartite graphs, as well as the number of $4$-cycles and $6$-cycles in irregular and half-regular bipartite graphs, with $g \\geq 4$ and $g \\geq 6$, respectively.", "published": "2018-06-04 23:43:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01433v3", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "A Feynman-Kac type formula for a fixed delay CIR model", "abstract": "Stochastic delay differential equations (SDDE's) have been used for financial modeling. In this article, we study a SDDE obtained by the equation of a CIR process, with an additional fixed delay term in drift; in particular, we prove that there exists a unique strong solution (positive and integrable) which we call fixed delay CIR process. Moreover, for the fixed delay CIR process, we derive a Feynman-Kac type formula, leading to a generalized exponential-affine formula, which is used to determine a bond pricing formula when the interest rate follows the delay's equation. It turns out that, for each maturity time T, the instantaneous forward rate is an affine function (with time dependent coefficients) of the rate process and of an auxiliary process (also depending on T). The coefficients satisfy a system of deterministic delay differential equations.", "published": "2018-06-04 07:56:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00997v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
