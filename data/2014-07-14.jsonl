{"title": "Toward Network-based Keyword Extraction from Multitopic Web Documents", "abstract": "In this paper we analyse the selectivity measure calculated from the complex\nnetwork in the task of the automatic keyword extraction. Texts, collected from\ndifferent web sources (portals, forums), are represented as directed and\nweighted co-occurrence complex networks of words. Words are nodes and links are\nestablished between two nodes if they are directly co-occurring within the\nsentence. We test different centrality measures for ranking nodes - keyword\ncandidates. The promising results are achieved using the selectivity measure.\nThen we propose an approach which enables extracting word pairs according to\nthe values of the in/out selectivity and weight measures combined with\nfiltering.", "published": "2014-07-14 13:22:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3636v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Benchmarking Named Entity Disambiguation approaches for Streaming Graphs", "abstract": "Named Entity Disambiaguation (NED) is a central task for applications dealing\nwith natural language text. Assume that we have a graph based knowledge base\n(subsequently referred as Knowledge Graph) where nodes represent various real\nworld entities such as people, location, organization and concepts. Given data\nsources such as social media streams and web pages Entity Linking is the task\nof mapping named entities that are extracted from the data to those present in\nthe Knowledge Graph. This is an inherently difficult task due to several\nreasons. Almost all these data sources are generated without any formal\nontology; the unstructured nature of the input, limited context and the\nambiguity involved when multiple entities are mapped to the same name make this\na hard task. This report looks at two state of the art systems employing two\ndistinctive approaches: graph based Accurate Online Disambiguation of Entities\n(AIDA) and Mined Evidence Named Entity Disambiguation (MENED), which employs a\nstatistical inference approach. We compare both approaches using the data set\nand queries provided by the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track at 2011 NIST\nText Analytics Conference (TAC). This report begins with an overview of the\nrespective approaches, followed by detailed description of the experimental\nsetup. It concludes with our findings from the benchmarking exercise.", "published": "2014-07-14 18:01:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3751v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
