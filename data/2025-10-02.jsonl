{"title": "Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation", "abstract": "In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond\nto a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the\n\"battle\" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The\nprevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as\ntwo-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its\nderivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,\nwe question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and\nhence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that\ndraws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then\nboth models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena\ndatasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative\nincrease in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all\nfour rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for\nqueries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of\n1.37 and 1.35, respectively.

Our results show that, while some models using\ntext-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules\nare often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended\nabstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general\nabstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.\nIn the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our\nrule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still\nexhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but\nare often unable to correctly apply these rules.

On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and\nprovides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy\nand refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but\npreviously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high\naccuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and\nfragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy\nmetrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.", "published": "2025-10-02 08:20:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required.", "published": "2025-10-02 02:30:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01600v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering", "abstract": "Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a\ncritical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information\n(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,\nor on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on\nless-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial\nprojections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden\nstates. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical\nfeatures that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly\nalign with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper\nexplores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We\nshow that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable\nsignature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we\npresent Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately\nminimalist, non-parametric verifier.

{"title": "MetaboT: AI-based agent for natural language-based interaction with metabolomics knowledge graphs", "abstract": "Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring\nadvanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries.

Some\nrecent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and\nperform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D\nscene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations\nfor robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to\ndecouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and\nreconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this\nend, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based\non a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent\nimages into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion\nmodel to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D\nscenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view\ndegradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from\nlarge-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image\ninconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of\nour method in robust reconstruction.

User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on\na coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a\nfine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as\nhaving scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively\nif the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on\nthe total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores\nand the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally\npartitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside\neach bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can\nbe queried to refine the current ranking.

{"title": "Robust Tangent Space Estimation via Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization", "abstract": "Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in\ndata analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis\n(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in\nchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior\nknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise.

We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also\nenables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning\n(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide\na comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature\nvoting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling.

Empirical results show that Veri-R1 improves joint\naccuracy by up to 30% and doubles the evidence score, often surpassing its\nlarger-scale model counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the impact of\nreward components, and the link between output logits and label accuracy. Our\nresults highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and faithful claim\nverification, providing an important foundation for future research. We release\nour code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim verification.", "published": "2025-10-02 11:49:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01932v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning", "abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use\nagents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint\nreasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when\nthe modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?\nTo better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:\nscenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This\nallows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason\njointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can\nrecognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of\nthe time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across\nmodalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of\nmultiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,\nshowing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,\ndisproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal\nattention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or\nmultilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that\nexplicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and\nscalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each\ntraining instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention\nimbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several\nvision-language benchmarks.

Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,\ngiven the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to\nthe classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher\ninformation matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization\nof the relative entropy or the R\\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I\nderive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\\alpha$-$z$, and\ngeometric R\\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so\nbeing the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.\nInterestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$,\nthe log-Euclidean R\\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information\nmatrix, and the geometric R\\'enyi relative entropy leads to the\nright-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting\ninformation matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative\nvalues of the R\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$ even though the original quantities do\nnot.

{"title": "NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications", "abstract": "To effectively process impulse noise for narrowband powerline communications\n(NB-PLCs) transceivers, capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic\nasynchronous impulsive noise (APIN) is a critical task. However, existing\nmathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics\nof noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network\n(GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated\ncharacteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To\nclosely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we\nmeasured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering\ncircuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train\nNGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input\nsignals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise\ngeneration; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance\nthe similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure\nthe similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and\npractically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative\nanalyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral\ncyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter;\nand 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems.

The two most common defect categories of DIP\nare examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack\nof defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks.
