{"title": "Markov-Functional Models with Local Drift", "abstract": "We introduce a Markov-functional approach to construct local volatility\nmodels that are calibrated to a discrete set of marginal distributions. The\nmethod is inspired by and extends the volatility interpolation of Bass (1983)\nand Conze and Henry-Labord\\`ere (2022). The method is illustrated with\nefficient numerical algorithms in the cases where the constructed local\nvolatility functions are: (1) time-homogeneous between or (2) continuous\nacross, the successive maturities. The step-wise time-homogeneous construction\nproduces a parsimonious representation of the local volatility term structure.", "published": "2024-11-22 16:40:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15053v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "A New Way: Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature Deep Hedging and its Benefits", "abstract": "This paper advances the computational efficiency of Deep Hedging frameworks\nthrough the novel integration of Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature\n(K-FAC) optimization. While recent literature has established Deep Hedging as a\ndata-driven alternative to traditional risk management strategies, the\ncomputational burden of training neural networks with first-order methods\nremains a significant impediment to practical implementation. The proposed\narchitecture couples Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with K-FAC\nsecond-order optimization, specifically addressing the challenges of sequential\nfinancial data and curvature estimation in recurrent networks. Empirical\nvalidation using simulated paths from a calibrated Heston stochastic volatility\nmodel demonstrates that the K-FAC implementation achieves marked improvements\nin convergence dynamics and hedging efficacy. The methodology yields a 78.3%\nreduction in transaction costs ($t = 56.88$, $p < 0.001$) and a 34.4% decrease\nin profit and loss (P&L) variance compared to Adam optimization. Moreover, the\nK-FAC-enhanced model exhibits superior risk-adjusted performance with a Sharpe\nratio of 0.0401, contrasting with $-0.0025$ for the baseline model. These\nresults provide compelling evidence that second-order optimization methods can\nmaterially enhance the tractability of Deep Hedging implementations. The\nfindings contribute to the growing literature on computational methods in\nquantitative finance while highlighting the potential for advanced optimization\ntechniques to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical\napplications in financial markets.", "published": "2024-11-22 15:19:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15002v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Understanding the Impact of News Articles on the Movement of Market Index: A Case on Nifty 50", "abstract": "In the recent past, there were several works on the prediction of stock price\nusing different methods. Sentiment analysis of news and tweets and relating\nthem to the movement of stock prices have already been explored. But, when we\ntalk about the news, there can be several topics such as politics, markets,\nsports etc. It was observed that most of the prior analyses dealt with news or\ncomments associated with particular stock prices only or the researchers dealt\nwith overall sentiment scores only. However, it is quite possible that\ndifferent topics having different levels of impact on the movement of the stock\nprice or an index. The current study focused on bridging this gap by analysing\nthe movement of Nifty 50 index with respect to the sentiments associated with\nnews items related to various different topic such as sports, politics, markets\netc. The study established that sentiment scores of news items of different\nother topics also have a significant impact on the movement of the index.", "published": "2024-11-22 06:09:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06794v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
