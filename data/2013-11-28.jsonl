{"title": "Learning Semantic Representations for the Phrase Translation Model", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel semantic-based phrase translation model. A pair\nof source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector\nrepresentations in a low-dimensional latent semantic space, where their\ntranslation score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new\nspace. The projection is performed by a multi-layer neural network whose\nweights are learned on parallel training data. The learning is aimed to\ndirectly optimize the quality of end-to-end machine translation results.\nExperimental evaluation has been performed on two Europarl translation tasks,\nEnglish-French and German-English. The results show that the new semantic-based\nphrase translation model significantly improves the performance of a\nstate-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation sys-tem, leading\nto a gain of 0.7-1.0 BLEU points.", "published": "2013-11-28 04:58:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0482v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
