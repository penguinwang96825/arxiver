{"title": "Bidirectional Attention for SQL Generation", "abstract": "Generating structural query language (SQL) queries from natural language is a\nlong-standing open problem. Answering a natural language question about a\ndatabase table requires modeling complex interactions between the columns of\nthe table and the question. In this paper, we apply the synthesizing approach\nto solve this problem. Based on the structure of SQL queries, we break down the\nmodel to three sub-modules and design specific deep neural networks for each of\nthem. Taking inspiration from the similar machine reading task, we employ the\nbidirectional attention mechanisms and character-level embedding with\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve the result. Experimental\nevaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results in\nWikiSQL dataset.", "published": "2017-12-30 02:38:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00076v6", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Compare, Compress and Propagate: Enhancing Neural Architectures with\n  Alignment Factorization for Natural Language Inference", "abstract": "This paper presents a new deep learning architecture for Natural Language\nInference (NLI). Firstly, we introduce a new architecture where alignment pairs\nare compared, compressed and then propagated to upper layers for enhanced\nrepresentation learning. Secondly, we adopt factorization layers for efficient\nand expressive compression of alignment vectors into scalar features, which are\nthen used to augment the base word representations. The design of our approach\nis aimed to be conceptually simple, compact and yet powerful. We conduct\nexperiments on three popular benchmarks, SNLI, MultiNLI and SciTail, achieving\ncompetitive performance on all. A lightweight parameterization of our model\nalso enjoys a $\\approx 3$ times reduction in parameter size compared to the\nexisting state-of-the-art models, e.g., ESIM and DIIN, while maintaining\ncompetitive performance. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our\npropagated features are highly interpretable.", "published": "2017-12-30 08:54:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00102v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The origins of Zipf's meaning-frequency law", "abstract": "In his pioneering research, G. K. Zipf observed that more frequent words tend\nto have more meanings, and showed that the number of meanings of a word grows\nas the square root of its frequency. He derived this relationship from two\nassumptions: that words follow Zipf's law for word frequencies (a power law\ndependency between frequency and rank) and Zipf's law of meaning distribution\n(a power law dependency between number of meanings and rank). Here we show that\na single assumption on the joint probability of a word and a meaning suffices\nto infer Zipf's meaning-frequency law or relaxed versions. Interestingly, this\nassumption can be justified as the outcome of a biased random walk in the\nprocess of mental exploration.", "published": "2017-12-30 17:59:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00168v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Logarithmic Frequency Scaling and Consistent Frequency Coverage for the\n  Selection of Auditory Filterbank Center Frequencies", "abstract": "This paper provides new insights into the problem of selecting filter center\nfrequencies for the auditory filterbanks. We propose to use a constant\nfrequency distance and a consistent frequency coverage as the two metrics that\nmotivate the logarithmic frequency scaling and a regularized selection of\ncenter frequencies. The frequency scaling and the consistent frequency coverage\nhave been derived based on a common harmonic speaker signal model. Furthermore,\nwe have found that the existing linear equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB)\nfunction as well as any possible linear ERB approximation can also lead to a\nconsistent frequency coverage. The results are verified and demonstrated using\nthe gammatone filterbank.", "published": "2017-12-30 02:32:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00075v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
