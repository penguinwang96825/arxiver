A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy\nand performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a\nfine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most\neffectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training\nprocess into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage\nand plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism\nvaries across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative\nsamples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn\ndrives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning\nefficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in\nlow-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences.

By exploring this, this paper introduces the\nforgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)\nwith long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates\nthree key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,\nwhich is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic\nspatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that\ncan adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling\nthe collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical\nmulti-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by\nmodeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics\nof users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online\nA/B tests and achieved a 1.54\\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).\nIn addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nbidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical\nqueries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional\nrelevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces\ntwo query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from\nmulti-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate\nstructured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from\nintra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial\nelements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and\nprompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance\nannotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the\ngeneration relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method\nto enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed\na Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k\nChinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and\nrich relevance labels.

We address\nthis gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed\nusing computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve\ncross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of\na foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across\nmultiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets\ntailored to specific medical modalities.

However, current performance evaluation protocols\nfor VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop\nsettings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative\nclosed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,\nand real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified\nhierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive\nassessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by\ndual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation\nenvironments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,\nheterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast\nsystem) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into\nstandardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control\nabstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level\nactuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs\non physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

To\nthis end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a\ntraining-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window\nfor adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed\nfrequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic\nrelationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric\nscaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across\nvarying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention\nmechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different\nsequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range\ndependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of\nRoPE-based LLMs without training.

{"title": "Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks", "abstract": "Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nis an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality.

{"title": "Charting 15 years of progress in deep learning for speech emotion recognition: A replication study", "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) has long benefited from the adoption of deep\nlearning methodologies. Deeper models -- with more layers and more trainable\nparameters -- are generally perceived as being `better' by the SER community.\nThis raises the question -- \\emph{how much better} are modern-era deep neural\nnetworks compared to their earlier iterations? Beyond that, the more important\nquestion of how to move forward remains as poignant as ever. SER is far from a\nsolved problem; therefore, identifying the most prominent avenues of future\nresearch is of paramount importance. In the present contribution, we attempt a\nquantification of progress in the 15 years of research beginning with the\nintroduction of the landmark 2009 INTERSPEECH Emotion Challenge. We conduct a\nlarge scale investigation of model architectures, spanning both audio-based\nmodels that rely on speech inputs and text-baed models that rely solely on\ntranscriptions. Our results point towards diminishing returns and a plateau\nafter the recent introduction of transformer architectures. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate how perceptions of progress are conditioned on the particular\nselection of models that are compared.

{"title": "Fast Algorithm for Moving Sound Source", "abstract": "Modern neural network-based speech processing systems need reverberation\nresistance, relying on large amounts of reverberation data for training.\nExisting methods simulate dynamic scenarios by sampling static systems or\nsupplement with measured data, but struggle to simulate motion data conforming\nto physical laws. To address insufficient training data for speech enhancement\nmodels in moving scenarios, this paper proposes Yang's motion spatio-temporal\nsampling reconstruction theory, enabling efficient simulation of motion-induced\ncontinuous time-varying reverberation. It breaks through the limitations of\ntraditional static Image-Source Method (ISM) in time-varying systems by\ndecomposing the moving image source's impulse response into linear\ntime-invariant modulation and discrete time-varying fractional delay,\nestablishing a physics-compliant moving sound field model. Based on the\nband-limited nature of motion displacement, a hierarchical sampling strategy is\nadopted: high sampling rates for low-order images to retain details, and low\nrates for high-order ones to reduce complexity, combined with a fast synthesis\narchitecture for real-time simulation. Experiments show that compared to\nopen-source model GSound, the theory more accurately restores amplitude and\nphase changes in moving scenarios, solving the industry challenge of motion\nsound source data simulation.

{"title": "Zak-OTFS for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling in the Presence of Mobility & Delay Spread", "abstract": "Orthogonal signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in\nbandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$. This corresponds to the Nyquist\nsignaling and is achieved by mounting information symbols on $BT$-dimensional\nbasis spanning the $BT$-dimensional space spaced $\\frac{1}{B}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ apart. Faster-than-Nyquist signaling involves transmitting more\nthan $BT$ informational symbols in a $BT$-dimensional space. This leads to loss\nof orthogonality. This is achieved by time and/or bandwidth expansion resulting\nfrom packing more information symbols in the same $BT$-dimensional space\n(spacing less than $\\frac{1}{B}$ and/or $\\frac{1}{T}$). In this paper, we take\na different approach to faster-than-Nyquist signaling. We propose to\nsuperimpose the information symbols on one another maintaining the original\nspacing in the Nyquist signaling. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS)\nmodulation. In Zak-OTFS, the channel varies slowly. Further Zak-OTFS also\nallows construction of mutually unbiased bases the interference between which\nappear like Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme leverages the slow variation in\nthe DD channel to construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the\ndoubly-spread channel. Further, in the proposed scheme we mount information\nsymbols on two mutually unbiased bases which allows superposition of\ninformation symbols. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in\nGaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This\nreduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to enhance\nbit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nfaster-than-Nyquist signaling scheme achieves similar uncoded performance as\nthat of Nyquist signaling and with coding the performance is better than\nNyquist signaling at high signal-to-noise ratios.", "published": "2025-08-04 23:18:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02950v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

This study presents a novel multimodal monitoring framework,\nsynergistically integrating contact-based acoustic emission (AE) sensing with\ncoaxial camera vision to enable layer-wise identification and evaluation of\ngeometric variations in DED parts. The experimental study used three part\nconfigurations: a baseline part without holes, a part with a 3mm diameter\nthrough-hole, and one with a 5mm through-hole to test the system's discerning\ncapabilities. Raw sensor data was preprocessed: acoustic signals were filtered\nfor time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction, while camera data\nunderwent melt pool segmentation and morphological feature extraction. Multiple\nmachine learning algorithms (including SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) were\nevaluated to find the optimal model for classifying layer-wise geometric\nvariations. The integrated multimodal strategy achieved a superior\nclassification performance of 94.4%, compared to 87.8% for AE only and 86.7%\nfor the camera only.
