{"title": "On the length of attractors in boolean networks with an interaction graph by layers", "abstract": "We consider a boolean network whose interaction graph has no circuit of length >1. Under this hypothesis, we establish an upper bound on the length of the attractors of the network which only depends on its interaction graph.", "published": "2008-10-30 13:21:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5482v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
