{"title": "Evaluating Indirect Strategies for Chinese-Spanish Statistical Machine\n  Translation", "abstract": "Although, Chinese and Spanish are two of the most spoken languages in the\nworld, not much research has been done in machine translation for this language\npair. This paper focuses on investigating the state-of-the-art of\nChinese-to-Spanish statistical machine translation (SMT), which nowadays is one\nof the most popular approaches to machine translation. For this purpose, we\nreport details of the available parallel corpus which are Basic Traveller\nExpressions Corpus (BTEC), Holy Bible and United Nations (UN). Additionally, we\nconduct experimental work with the largest of these three corpora to explore\nalternative SMT strategies by means of using a pivot language. Three\nalternatives are considered for pivoting: cascading, pseudo-corpus and\ntriangulation. As pivot language, we use either English, Arabic or French.\nResults show that, for a phrase-based SMT system, English is the best pivot\nlanguage between Chinese and Spanish. We propose a system output combination\nusing the pivot strategies which is capable of outperforming the direct\ntranslation strategy. The main objective of this work is motivating and\ninvolving the research community to work in this important pair of languages\ngiven their demographic impact.", "published": "2014-02-04 01:34:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0563v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Natural Language Inference for Arabic Using Extended Tree Edit Distance\n  with Subtrees", "abstract": "Many natural language processing (NLP) applications require the computation\nof similarities between pairs of syntactic or semantic trees. Many researchers\nhave used tree edit distance for this task, but this technique suffers from the\ndrawback that it deals with single node operations only. We have extended the\nstandard tree edit distance algorithm to deal with subtree transformation\noperations as well as single nodes. The extended algorithm with subtree\noperations, TED+ST, is more effective and flexible than the standard algorithm,\nespecially for applications that pay attention to relations among nodes (e.g.\nin linguistic trees, deleting a modifier subtree should be cheaper than the sum\nof deleting its components individually). We describe the use of TED+ST for\nchecking entailment between two Arabic text snippets. The preliminary results\nof using TED+ST were encouraging when compared with two string-based approaches\nand with the standard algorithm.", "published": "2014-02-04 01:40:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0578v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Topic Segmentation and Labeling in Asynchronous Conversations", "abstract": "Topic segmentation and labeling is often considered a prerequisite for\nhigher-level conversation analysis and has been shown to be useful in many\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) applications. We present two new corpora of\nemail and blog conversations annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator\nreliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous\nconversations. We propose a complete computational framework for topic\nsegmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations. Our approach extends\nstate-of-the-art methods by considering a fine-grained structure of an\nasynchronous conversation, along with other conversational features by applying\nrecent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation, we propose two\nnovel unsupervised models that exploit the fine-grained conversational\nstructure, and a novel graph-theoretic supervised model that combines lexical,\nconversational and topic features. For topic labeling, we propose two novel\n(unsupervised) random walk models that respectively capture conversation\nspecific clues from two different sources: the leading sentences and the\nfine-grained conversational structure. Empirical evaluation shows that the\nsegmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the\nstate-of-the-art, and are highly correlated with human annotations.", "published": "2014-02-04 01:43:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0586v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generating Extractive Summaries of Scientific Paradigms", "abstract": "Researchers and scientists increasingly find themselves in the position of\nhaving to quickly understand large amounts of technical material. Our goal is\nto effectively serve this need by using bibliometric text mining and\nsummarization techniques to generate summaries of scientific literature. We\nshow how we can use citations to produce automatically generated, readily\nconsumable, technical extractive summaries. We first propose C-LexRank, a model\nfor summarizing single scientific articles based on citations, which employs\ncommunity detection and extracts salient information-rich sentences. Next, we\nfurther extend our experiments to summarize a set of papers, which cover the\nsame scientific topic. We generate extractive summaries of a set of Question\nAnswering (QA) and Dependency Parsing (DP) papers, their abstracts, and their\ncitation sentences and show that citations have unique information amenable to\ncreating a summary.", "published": "2014-02-04 01:33:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0556v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
