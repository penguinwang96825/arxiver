{"title": "High-frequency lead-lag relationships in the Chinese stock index futures market: tick-by-tick dynamics of calendar spreads", "abstract": "Lead-lag relationships, integral to market dynamics, offer valuable insights\ninto the trading behavior of high-frequency traders (HFTs) and the flow of\ninformation at a granular level. This paper investigates the lead-lag\nrelationships between stock index futures contracts of different maturities in\nthe Chinese financial futures market (CFFEX). Using high-frequency\n(tick-by-tick) data, we analyze how price movements in near-month futures\ncontracts influence those in longer-dated contracts, such as next-month,\nquarterly, and semi-annual contracts. Our findings reveal a consistent pattern\nof price discovery, with the near-month contract leading the others by one\ntick, driven primarily by liquidity. Additionally, we identify a negative\nfeedback effect of the \"lead-lag spread\" on the leading asset, which can\npredict returns of leading asset. Backtesting results demonstrate the\nprofitability of trading based on the lead-lag spread signal, even after\naccounting for transaction costs. Altogether, our analysis offers valuable\ninsights to understand and capitalize on the evolving dynamics of futures\nmarkets.", "published": "2025-01-06 17:40:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03171v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.ST", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

We introduce a\nstep-by-step methodological approach on how a person would verify the model\nassumptions. The methodology involves estimating the model parameters and\napproximating the driving process. We demonstrate how to use the increments of\nthe approximated driving process, along with the estimated parameters, to test\nthe assumptions that the CAR(1) process is L\\'evy-driven. We then show how to\ntest the hypothesis that the CAR(1) process belongs to a specified class of\nL\\'evy processes. The performance of the tests is illustrated through multiple\nsimulations. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply the methodology step-by-step\nto a variety of economic and financial data examples.", "published": "2025-01-06 23:36:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03434v2", "categories": ["stat.AP", "q-fin.ST", "60, 62"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
