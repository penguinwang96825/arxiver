{"title": "Towards a relation extraction framework for cyber-security concepts", "abstract": "In order to assist security analysts in obtaining information pertaining to\ntheir network, such as novel vulnerabilities, exploits, or patches, information\nretrieval methods tailored to the security domain are needed. As labeled text\ndata is scarce and expensive, we follow developments in semi-supervised Natural\nLanguage Processing and implement a bootstrapping algorithm for extracting\nsecurity entities and their relationships from text. The algorithm requires\nlittle input data, specifically, a few relations or patterns (heuristics for\nidentifying relations), and incorporates an active learning component which\nqueries the user on the most important decisions to prevent drifting from the\ndesired relations. Preliminary testing on a small corpus shows promising\nresults, obtaining precision of .82.", "published": "2015-04-16 17:26:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04317v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.CR", "H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
