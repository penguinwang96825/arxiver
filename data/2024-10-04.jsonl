{"title": "Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights", "abstract": "We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic\noutlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall\nmeasure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as\nGDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10\nquarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures,\nincluding survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide\nvaluable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our\nfindings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about\neconomic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic\ndecision-making.", "published": "2024-10-04 19:57:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897v3", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "A Dynamic Approach to Stock Price Prediction: Comparing RNN and Mixture of Experts Models Across Different Volatility Profiles", "abstract": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model\nfor stock price prediction by comparing it to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nand a linear regression model. The MoE framework combines an RNN for volatile\nstocks and a linear model for stable stocks, dynamically adjusting the weight\nof each model through a gating network. Results indicate that the MoE approach\nsignificantly improves predictive accuracy across different volatility\nprofiles. The RNN effectively captures non-linear patterns for volatile\ncompanies but tends to overfit stable data, whereas the linear model performs\nwell for predictable trends. The MoE model's adaptability allows it to\noutperform each individual model, reducing errors such as Mean Squared Error\n(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Future work should focus on enhancing the\ngating mechanism and validating the model with real-world datasets to optimize\nits practical applicability.", "published": "2024-10-04 14:36:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07234v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "econ.EM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Leveraging Fundamental Analysis for Stock Trend Prediction for Profit", "abstract": "This paper investigates the application of machine learning models, Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM), one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D\nCNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), for predicting stock trends based on\nfundamental analysis. Unlike most existing studies that predominantly utilize\ntechnical or sentiment analysis, we emphasize the use of a company's financial\nstatements and intrinsic value for trend forecasting. Using a dataset of 269\ndata points from publicly traded companies across various sectors from 2019 to\n2023, we employ key financial ratios and the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model\nto formulate two prediction tasks: Annual Stock Price Difference (ASPD) and\nDifference between Current Stock Price and Intrinsic Value (DCSPIV). These\ntasks assess the likelihood of annual profit and current profitability,\nrespectively. Our results demonstrate that LR models outperform CNN and LSTM\nmodels, achieving an average test accuracy of 74.66% for ASPD and 72.85% for\nDCSPIV. This study contributes to the limited literature on integrating\nfundamental analysis into machine learning for stock prediction, offering\nvaluable insights for both academic research and practical investment\nstrategies. By leveraging fundamental data, our approach highlights the\npotential for long-term stock trend prediction, supporting portfolio managers\nin their decision-making processes.", "published": "2024-10-04 20:36:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03913v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Cyber Risk Taxonomies: Statistical Analysis of Cybersecurity Risk Classifications", "abstract": "Cyber risk classifications are widely used in the modeling of cyber event\ndistributions, yet their effectiveness in out of sample forecasting performance\nremains underexplored. In this paper, we analyse the most commonly used\nclassifications and argue in favour of switching the attention from\ngoodness-of-fit and in-sample predictive performance, to focusing on the out-of\nsample forecasting performance. We use a rolling window analysis, to compare\ncyber risk distribution forecasts via threshold weighted scoring functions. Our\nresults indicate that business motivated cyber risk classifications appear to\nbe too restrictive and not flexible enough to capture the heterogeneity of\ncyber risk events. We investigate how dynamic and impact-based cyber risk\nclassifiers seem to be better suited in forecasting future cyber risk losses\nthan the other considered classifications. These findings suggest that cyber\nrisk types provide limited forecasting ability concerning cyber event severity\ndistribution, and cyber insurance ratemakers should utilize cyber risk types\nonly when modeling the cyber event frequency distribution. Our study offers\nvaluable insights for decision-makers and policymakers alike, contributing to\nthe advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of cyber risk management.", "published": "2024-10-04 04:12:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05297v1", "categories": ["cs.CR", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}
