{"title": "Sentiment trading with large language models", "abstract": "We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment\nanalysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market\nreturns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from\nJanuary 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs,\nincluding BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nmodel, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The\nstudy documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent\ndaily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the\nhighest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly\nahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald\ndictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1%\naccuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model\nscores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in\ndifferent model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive\nrelevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant\nrelationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock\nreturns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current\nfinancial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels\nwith a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT\nlong-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nyield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior\nperformance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction\nand portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of\nfinancial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy\nanalysis.", "published": "2024-12-26 15:01:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19245v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "econ.EM", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations", "abstract": "In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties\nof the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral\nequations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear\ndependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component\nof the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The\nwell-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which\nrenders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes\nwhile contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic\ninterpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semi-linear\npartial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of\nBSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize\ndynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment\nopportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands\nbeing identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.", "published": "2024-12-26 14:34:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236v2", "categories": ["math.PR", "math.AP", "q-fin.MF", "60H10, 60H20, 35K55"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
{"title": "A System of BSDEs with Singular Terminal Values Arising in Optimal Liquidation with Regime Switching", "abstract": "We study a stochastic control problem with regime switching arising in an\noptimal liquidation problem with dark pools and multiple regimes. The new\nfeature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and\nwith singular terminal values, which appears in literature for the first time.\nThe existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the\nstochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, the\nuniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely\nminimal solutions established in most related literature.", "published": "2024-12-26 05:03:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19058v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Travelling wave solutions of an equation of Harry Dym type arising in the Black-Scholes framework", "abstract": "The Black-Scholes framework is crucial in pricing a vast number of financial\ninstruments that permeate the complex dynamics of world markets. Associated\nwith this framework, we consider a second-order differential operator $L(x,\n{\\partial_x}) := v^2(x,t) (\\partial_x^2 -\\partial_x)$ that carries a variable\nvolatility term $v(x,t)$ and which is dependent on the underlying log-price $x$\nand a time parameter $t$ motivated by the celebrated Dupire local volatility\nmodel. In this context, we ask and answer the question of whether one can find\na non-linear evolution equation derived from a zero-curvature condition for a\ntime-dependent deformation of the operator $L$. The result is a variant of the\nHarry Dym equation for which we can then find a family of travelling wave\nsolutions. This brings in extensive machinery from soliton theory and\nintegrable systems. As a by-product, it opens up the way to the use of coherent\nstructures in financial-market volatility studies.", "published": "2024-12-26 02:09:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19020v1", "categories": ["math.NA", "cs.NA", "q-fin.MF", "35Q51, 35C08, 91G20, 35Q91"], "primary_category": "math.NA"}
