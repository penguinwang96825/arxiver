{"title": "Sentiment trading with large language models", "abstract": "We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment\nanalysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market\nreturns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from\nJanuary 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs,\nincluding BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nmodel, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The\nstudy documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent\ndaily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the\nhighest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly\nahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald\ndictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1%\naccuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model\nscores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in\ndifferent model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive\nrelevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant\nrelationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock\nreturns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current\nfinancial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels\nwith a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT\nlong-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nyield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior\nperformance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction\nand portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of\nfinancial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy\nanalysis.", "published": "2024-12-26 15:01:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19245v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "econ.EM", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Minimal Batch Adaptive Learning Policy Engine for Real-Time Mid-Price Forecasting in High-Frequency Trading", "abstract": "High-frequency trading (HFT) has transformed modern financial markets, making\nreliable short-term price forecasting models essential. In this study, we\npresent a novel approach to mid-price forecasting using Level 1 limit order\nbook (LOB) data from NASDAQ, focusing on 100 U.S. stocks from the S&P 500 index\nduring the period from September to November 2022. Expanding on our previous\nwork with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN), which leveraged\nautomated feature importance techniques based on mean decrease impurity (MDI)\nand gradient descent (GD), we introduce the Adaptive Learning Policy Engine\n(ALPE) - a reinforcement learning (RL)-based agent designed for batch-free,\nimmediate mid-price forecasting. ALPE incorporates adaptive epsilon decay to\ndynamically balance exploration and exploitation, outperforming a diverse range\nof highly effective machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in\nforecasting performance.", "published": "2024-12-26 22:49:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19372v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
