{"title": "Genetic approach for arabic part of speech tagging", "abstract": "With the growing number of textual resources available, the ability to\nunderstand them becomes critical. An essential first step in understanding\nthese sources is the ability to identify the part of speech in each sentence.\nArabic is a morphologically rich language, wich presents a challenge for part\nof speech tagging. In this paper, our goal is to propose, improve and implement\na part of speech tagger based on a genetic alorithm. The accuracy obtained with\nthis method is comparable to that of other probabilistic approaches.", "published": "2013-07-11 10:21:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3489v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE", "68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Between Sense and Sensibility: Declarative narrativisation of mental\n  models as a basis and benchmark for visuo-spatial cognition and computation\n  focussed collaborative cognitive systems", "abstract": "What lies between `\\emph{sensing}' and `\\emph{sensibility}'? In other words,\nwhat kind of cognitive processes mediate sensing capability, and the formation\nof sensible impressions ---e.g., abstractions, analogies, hypotheses and theory\nformation, beliefs and their revision, argument formation--- in domain-specific\nproblem solving, or in regular activities of everyday living, working and\nsimply going around in the environment? How can knowledge and reasoning about\nsuch capabilities, as exhibited by humans in particular problem contexts, be\nused as a model and benchmark for the development of collaborative cognitive\n(interaction) systems concerned with human assistance, assurance, and\nempowerment?\n  We pose these questions in the context of a range of assistive technologies\nconcerned with \\emph{visuo-spatial perception and cognition} tasks encompassing\naspects such as commonsense, creativity, and the application of specialist\ndomain knowledge and problem-solving thought processes. Assistive technologies\nbeing considered include: (a) human activity interpretation; (b) high-level\ncognitive rovotics; (c) people-centred creative design in domains such as\narchitecture & digital media creation, and (d) qualitative analyses geographic\ninformation systems. Computational narratives not only provide a rich cognitive\nbasis, but they also serve as a benchmark of functional performance in our\ndevelopment of computational cognitive assistance systems. We posit that\ncomputational narrativisation pertaining to space, actions, and change provides\na useful model of \\emph{visual} and \\emph{spatio-temporal thinking} within a\nwide-range of problem-solving tasks and application areas where collaborative\ncognitive systems could serve an assistive and empowering function.", "published": "2013-07-11 10:01:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3040v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.HC", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
