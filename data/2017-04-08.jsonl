{"title": "On the Linearity of Semantic Change: Investigating Meaning Variation via\n  Dynamic Graph Models", "abstract": "We consider two graph models of semantic change. The first is a time-series\nmodel that relates embedding vectors from one time period to embedding vectors\nof previous time periods. In the second, we construct one graph for each word:\nnodes in this graph correspond to time points and edge weights to the\nsimilarity of the word's meaning across two time points. We apply our two\nmodels to corpora across three different languages. We find that semantic\nchange is linear in two senses. Firstly, today's embedding vectors (= meaning)\nof words can be derived as linear combinations of embedding vectors of their\nneighbors in previous time periods. Secondly, self-similarity of words decays\nlinearly in time. We consider both findings as new laws/hypotheses of semantic\nchange.", "published": "2017-04-08 13:56:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02497v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
