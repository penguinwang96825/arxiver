{"title": "Improved Frame Level Features and SVM Supervectors Approach for the\n  Recogniton of Emotional States from Speech: Application to categorical and\n  dimensional states", "abstract": "The purpose of speech emotion recognition system is to classify speakers\nutterances into different emotional states such as disgust, boredom, sadness,\nneutral and happiness. Speech features that are commonly used in speech emotion\nrecognition rely on global utterance level prosodic features. In our work, we\nevaluate the impact of frame level feature extraction. The speech samples are\nfrom Berlin emotional database and the features extracted from these utterances\nare energy, different variant of mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, velocity\nand acceleration features.", "published": "2014-06-23 22:21:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6101v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "VideoSET: Video Summary Evaluation through Text", "abstract": "In this paper we present VideoSET, a method for Video Summary Evaluation\nthrough Text that can evaluate how well a video summary is able to retain the\nsemantic information contained in its original video. We observe that semantics\nis most easily expressed in words, and develop a text-based approach for the\nevaluation. Given a video summary, a text representation of the video summary\nis first generated, and an NLP-based metric is then used to measure its\nsemantic distance to ground-truth text summaries written by humans. We show\nthat our technique has higher agreement with human judgment than pixel-based\ndistance metrics. We also release text annotations and ground-truth text\nsummaries for a number of publicly available video datasets, for use by the\ncomputer vision community.", "published": "2014-06-23 07:56:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5824v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
