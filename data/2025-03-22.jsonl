{"title": "Clearing Sections of Lattice Liability Networks", "abstract": "Modern financial networks involve complex obligations that transcend simple\nmonetary debts: multiple currencies, prioritized claims, supply chain\ndependencies, and more. We present a mathematical framework that unifies and\nextends these scenarios by recasting the classical Eisenberg-Noe model of\nfinancial clearing in terms of lattice liability networks. Each node in the\nnetwork carries a complete lattice of possible states, while edges encode\nnominal liabilities. Our framework generalizes the scalar-valued clearing\nvectors of the classical model to lattice-valued clearing sections, preserving\nthe elegant fixed-point structure while dramatically expanding its descriptive\npower. Our main theorem establishes that such networks possess clearing\nsections that themselves form a complete lattice under the product order. This\nstructure theorem enables tractable analysis of equilibria in diverse domains,\nincluding multi-currency financial systems, decentralized finance with\nautomated market makers, supply chains with resource transformation, and\npermission networks with complex authorization structures. We further extend\nour framework to chain-complete lattices for term structure models and\nmultivalued mappings for complex negotiation systems. Our results demonstrate\nhow lattice theory provides a natural language for understanding complex\nnetwork dynamics across multiple domains, creating a unified mathematical\nfoundation for analyzing systemic risk, resource allocation, and network\nstability.", "published": "2025-03-22 18:38:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17836v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "91G40, 06B23, 91D30, 68Q85"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Mathematical Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Utilizing Machine Learning Tools for Assessing the Impact of Climate Lobbying", "abstract": "Climate policy and legislation has a significant influence on both domestic\nand global responses to the pressing environmental challenges of our time. The\neffectiveness of such climate legislation is closely tied to the complex\ndynamics among elected officials, a dynamic significantly shaped by the\nrelentless efforts of lobbying. This project aims to develop a novel\ncompartmental model to forecast the trajectory of climate legislation within\nthe United States. By understanding the dynamics surrounding floor votes, the\nramifications of lobbying, and the flow of campaign donations within the\nchambers of the U.S. Congress, we aim to validate our model through a\ncomprehensive case study of the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACESA).\nOur model adeptly captures the nonlinear dynamics among diverse legislative\nfactions, including centrists, ardent supporters, and vocal opponents of the\nbill, culminating in a rich dynamics of final voting outcomes. We conduct a\nstability analysis of the model, estimating parameters from public lobbying\nrecords and a robust body of existing literature. The numerical verification\nagainst the pivotal 2009 ACESA vote, alongside contemporary research,\nunderscores the models promising potential as a tool to understand the dynamics\nof climate lobbying. We also analyse the pathways of the model that aims to\nguide future legislative endeavors in the pursuit of effective climate action.", "published": "2025-03-22 17:38:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09617v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
