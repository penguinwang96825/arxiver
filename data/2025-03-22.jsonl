{"title": "Clearing Sections of Lattice Liability Networks", "abstract": "Modern financial networks involve complex obligations that transcend simple\nmonetary debts: multiple currencies, prioritized claims, supply chain\ndependencies, and more. We present a mathematical framework that unifies and\nextends these scenarios by recasting the classical Eisenberg-Noe model of\nfinancial clearing in terms of lattice liability networks. Each node in the\nnetwork carries a complete lattice of possible states, while edges encode\nnominal liabilities. Our framework generalizes the scalar-valued clearing\nvectors of the classical model to lattice-valued clearing sections, preserving\nthe elegant fixed-point structure while dramatically expanding its descriptive\npower. Our main theorem establishes that such networks possess clearing\nsections that themselves form a complete lattice under the product order. This\nstructure theorem enables tractable analysis of equilibria in diverse domains,\nincluding multi-currency financial systems, decentralized finance with\nautomated market makers, supply chains with resource transformation, and\npermission networks with complex authorization structures. We further extend\nour framework to chain-complete lattices for term structure models and\nmultivalued mappings for complex negotiation systems. Our results demonstrate\nhow lattice theory provides a natural language for understanding complex\nnetwork dynamics across multiple domains, creating a unified mathematical\nfoundation for analyzing systemic risk, resource allocation, and network\nstability.", "published": "2025-03-22 18:38:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17836v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "91G40, 06B23, 91D30, 68Q85"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
