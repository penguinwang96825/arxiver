{"title": "Structural Analysis of Hindi Phonetics and A Method for Extraction of\n  Phonetically Rich Sentences from a Very Large Hindi Text Corpus", "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Text to speech (TTS) are two prominent\narea of research in human computer interaction nowadays. A set of phonetically\nrich sentences is in a matter of importance in order to develop these two\ninteractive modules of HCI. Essentially, the set of phonetically rich sentences\nhas to cover all possible phone units distributed uniformly. Selecting such a\nset from a big corpus with maintaining phonetic characteristic based similarity\nis still a challenging problem. The major objective of this paper is to devise\na criteria in order to select a set of sentences encompassing all phonetic\naspects of a corpus with size as minimum as possible. First, this paper\npresents a statistical analysis of Hindi phonetics by observing the structural\ncharacteristics. Further a two stage algorithm is proposed to extract\nphonetically rich sentences with a high variety of triphones from the EMILLE\nHindi corpus. The algorithm consists of a distance measuring criteria to select\na sentence in order to improve the triphone distribution. Moreover, a special\npreprocessing method is proposed to score each triphone in terms of inverse\nprobability in order to fasten the algorithm. The results show that the\napproach efficiently build uniformly distributed phonetically-rich corpus with\noptimum number of sentences.", "published": "2017-01-30 15:37:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08655v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Predicting Auction Price of Vehicle License Plate with Deep Recurrent\n  Neural Network", "abstract": "In Chinese societies, superstition is of paramount importance, and vehicle\nlicense plates with desirable numbers can fetch very high prices in auctions.\nUnlike other valuable items, license plates are not allocated an estimated\nprice before auction. I propose that the task of predicting plate prices can be\nviewed as a natural language processing (NLP) task, as the value depends on the\nmeaning of each individual character on the plate and its semantics. I\nconstruct a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the prices of\nvehicle license plates in Hong Kong, based on the characters on a plate. I\ndemonstrate the importance of having a deep network and of retraining.\nEvaluated on 13 years of historical auction prices, the deep RNN's predictions\ncan explain over 80 percent of price variations, outperforming previous models\nby a significant margin. I also demonstrate how the model can be extended to\nbecome a search engine for plates and to provide estimates of the expected\nprice distribution.", "published": "2017-01-30 17:14:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08711v5", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-fin.EC", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Review of Methodologies for Natural-Language-Facilitated Human-Robot\n  Cooperation", "abstract": "Natural-language-facilitated human-robot cooperation (NLC) refers to using\nnatural language (NL) to facilitate interactive information sharing and task\nexecutions with a common goal constraint between robots and humans. Recently,\nNLC research has received increasing attention. Typical NLC scenarios include\nrobotic daily assistance, robotic health caregiving, intelligent manufacturing,\nautonomous navigation, and robot social accompany. However, a thorough review,\nthat can reveal latest methodologies to use NL to facilitate human-robot\ncooperation, is missing. In this review, a comprehensive summary about\nmethodologies for NLC is presented. NLC research includes three main research\nfocuses: NL instruction understanding, NL-based execution plan generation, and\nknowledge-world mapping. In-depth analyses on theoretical methods,\napplications, and model advantages and disadvantages are made. Based on our\npaper review and perspective, potential research directions of NLC are\nsummarized.", "published": "2017-01-30 18:59:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08756v3", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
