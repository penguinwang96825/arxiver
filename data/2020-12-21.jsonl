{"title": "Recoloring graphs of treewidth 2", "abstract": "Two (proper) colorings of a graph are adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex. Jerrum proved that any $(d + 2)$-coloring of any d-degenerate graph can be transformed into any other via a sequence of adjacent colorings. A result of Bonamy et al. ensures that a shortest transformation can have a quadratic length even for $d = 1$. Bousquet and Perarnau proved that a linear transformation exists for between $(2d + 2)$-colorings. It is open to determine if this bound can be reduced. In this note, we prove that it can be reduced for graphs of treewidth 2, which are 2-degenerate. There exists a linear transformation between 5-colorings. It completes the picture for graphs of treewidth 2 since there exist graphs of treewidth 2 such a linear transformation between 4-colorings does not exist.", "published": "2020-12-21 16:23:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11459v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
