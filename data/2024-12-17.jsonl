{"title": "Enhanced Momentum with Momentum Transformers", "abstract": "The primary objective of this research is to build a Momentum Transformer\nthat is expected to outperform benchmark time-series momentum and\nmean-reversion trading strategies. We extend the ideas introduced in the paper\nTrading with the Momentum Transformer: An Intelligent and Interpretable\nArchitecture to equities as the original paper primarily only builds upon\nfutures and equity indices. Unlike conventional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodels, which operate sequentially and are optimized for processing local\npatterns, an attention mechanism equips our architecture with direct access to\nall prior time steps in the training window. This hybrid design, combining\nattention with an LSTM, enables the model to capture long-term dependencies,\nenhance performance in scenarios accounting for transaction costs, and\nseamlessly adapt to evolving market conditions, such as those witnessed during\nthe Covid Pandemic. We average 4.14% returns which is similar to the original\npapers results. Our Sharpe is lower at an average of 1.12 due to much higher\nvolatility which may be due to stocks being inherently more volatile than\nfutures and indices.", "published": "2024-12-17 04:11:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12516v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Volatility-Volume Order Slicing via Statistical Analysis", "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges faced in large-volume trading, where\nexecuting substantial orders can result in significant market impact and\nslippage. To mitigate these effects, this study proposes a\nvolatility-volume-based order slicing strategy that leverages Exponential\nWeighted Moving Average and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. These methods\nare used to dynamically estimate future trading volumes and price ranges,\nenabling traders to adapt their strategies by segmenting order execution sizes\nbased on these predictions. Results show that the proposed approach improves\ntrade execution efficiency, reduces market impact, and offers a more adaptive\nsolution for volatile market conditions. The findings have practical\nimplications for large-volume trading, providing a foundation for further\nresearch into adaptive execution strategies.", "published": "2024-12-17 02:37:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12482v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Pontryagin-Guided Policy Optimization for Merton's Portfolio Problem", "abstract": "We present a Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework\nfor Merton's portfolio problem, unifying modern neural-network-based policy\nparameterization with the adjoint viewpoint from Pontryagin's maximum principle\n(PMP). Instead of approximating the value function (as done in deep BSDE\nmethods), we track a policy-fixed BSDE for the adjoint processes, which allows\neach gradient update to align with continuous-time PMP conditions. This setup\nyields locally optimal consumption and investment policies that are closely\ntied to classical stochastic control. We further incorporate an alignment\npenalty that nudges the learned policy toward Pontryagin-derived solutions,\nenhancing both convergence speed and training stability. Numerical experiments\nconfirm that PG-DPO effectively handles both consumption and investment,\nachieving strong performance and interpretability without requiring large\noffline datasets or model-free reinforcement learning.", "published": "2024-12-17 17:14:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13101v4", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}

{"title": "Productivity of Short Term Assets as a Signal of Future Stock Performance", "abstract": "This paper investigates cash productivity as a signal for future stock\nperformance, building on the cash-return framework of Faulkender and Wang\n(2006). Using financial and market data from WRDS, we calculate cash returns as\na proxy for operational efficiency and evaluate a long-only strategy applied to\nNasdaq-listed non-financial firms. Results show limited predictive power across\nthe broader Nasdaq universe but strong performance in a handpicked portfolio,\nwhich achieves significant positive alpha after controlling for the Fama-French\nthree factors. These findings underscore the importance of refined universe\nselection. While promising, the strategy requires further validation, including\nthe incorporation of transaction costs and performance testing across economic\ncycles. Our results suggest that cash productivity, when combined with other\ncomplementary signals and careful universe selection, can be a valuable tool\nfor generating excess returns.", "published": "2024-12-17 20:26:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13311v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}

We compare this\napproach to a naive pairs trading strategy that uses a rolling window to\ncalculate mean and standard deviation parameters.
