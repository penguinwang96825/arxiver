{"title": "How Much is 131 Million Dollars? Putting Numbers in Perspective with\n  Compositional Descriptions", "abstract": "How much is 131 million US dollars? To help readers put such numbers in\ncontext, we propose a new task of automatically generating short descriptions\nknown as perspectives, e.g. \"$131 million is about the cost to employ everyone\nin Texas over a lunch period\". First, we collect a dataset of numeric mentions\nin news articles, where each mention is labeled with a set of rated\nperspectives. We then propose a system to generate these descriptions\nconsisting of two steps: formula construction and description generation. In\nconstruction, we compose formulae from numeric facts in a knowledge base and\nrank the resulting formulas based on familiarity, numeric proximity and\nsemantic compatibility. In generation, we convert a formula into natural\nlanguage using a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network. Our system\nobtains a 15.2% F1 improvement over a non-compositional baseline at formula\nconstruction and a 12.5 BLEU point improvement over a baseline description\ngeneration.", "published": "2016-09-01 00:20:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00070v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "All Fingers are not Equal: Intensity of References in Scientific\n  Articles", "abstract": "Research accomplishment is usually measured by considering all citations with\nequal importance, thus ignoring the wide variety of purposes an article is\nbeing cited for. Here, we posit that measuring the intensity of a reference is\ncrucial not only to perceive better understanding of research endeavor, but\nalso to improve the quality of citation-based applications. To this end, we\ncollect a rich annotated dataset with references labeled by the intensity, and\npropose a novel graph-based semi-supervised model, GraLap to label the\nintensity of references. Experiments with AAN datasets show a significant\nimprovement compared to the baselines to achieve the true labels of the\nreferences (46% better correlation). Finally, we provide four applications to\ndemonstrate how the knowledge of reference intensity leads to design better\nreal-world applications.", "published": "2016-09-01 01:34:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00081v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Identifying Dogmatism in Social Media: Signals and Models", "abstract": "We explore linguistic and behavioral features of dogmatism in social media\nand construct statistical models that can identify dogmatic comments. Our model\nis based on a corpus of Reddit posts, collected across a diverse set of\nconversational topics and annotated via paid crowdsourcing. We operationalize\nkey aspects of dogmatism described by existing psychology theories (such as\nover-confidence), finding they have predictive power. We also find evidence for\nnew signals of dogmatism, such as the tendency of dogmatic posts to refrain\nfrom signaling cognitive processes. When we use our predictive model to analyze\nmillions of other Reddit posts, we find evidence that suggests dogmatism is a\ndeeper personality trait, present for dogmatic users across many different\ndomains, and that users who engage on dogmatic comments tend to show increases\nin dogmatic posts themselves.", "published": "2016-09-01 23:29:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00425v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
