{"title": "Syntactic Analysis Based on Morphological Characteristic Features of the\n  Romanian Language", "abstract": "This paper refers to the syntactic analysis of phrases in Romanian, as an\nimportant process of natural language processing. We will suggest a real-time\nsolution, based on the idea of using some words or groups of words that\nindicate grammatical category; and some specific endings of some parts of\nsentence. Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language,\nwhere some prepositions, adverbs or some specific endings can provide a lot of\ninformation about the structure of a complex sentence. Such characteristics can\nbe found in other languages, too, such as French. Using a special grammar, we\ndeveloped a system (DIASEXP) that can perform a dialogue in natural language\nwith assertive and interogative sentences about a \"story\" (a set of sentences\ndescribing some events from the real life).", "published": "2013-01-09 19:17:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1950v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
