{"title": "A Graph Traversal Based Approach to Answer Non-Aggregation Questions\n  Over DBpedia", "abstract": "We present a question answering system over DBpedia, filling the gap between\nuser information needs expressed in natural language and a structured query\ninterface expressed in SPARQL over the underlying knowledge base (KB). Given\nthe KB, our goal is to comprehend a natural language query and provide\ncorresponding accurate answers. Focusing on solving the non-aggregation\nquestions, in this paper, we construct a subgraph of the knowledge base from\nthe detected entities and propose a graph traversal method to solve both the\nsemantic item mapping problem and the disambiguation problem in a joint way.\nCompared with existing work, we simplify the process of query intention\nunderstanding and pay more attention to the answer path ranking. We evaluate\nour method on a non-aggregation question dataset and further on a complete\ndataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves best performance\ncompared with several state-of-the-art systems.", "published": "2015-10-16 05:35:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04780v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Normalization of Relative and Incomplete Temporal Expressions in\n  Clinical Narratives", "abstract": "We analyze the RI-TIMEXes in temporally annotated corpora and propose two\nhypotheses regarding the normalization of RI-TIMEXes in the clinical narrative\ndomain: the anchor point hypothesis and the anchor relation hypothesis. We\nannotate the RI-TIMEXes in three corpora to study the characteristics of\nRI-TMEXes in different domains. This informed the design of our RI-TIMEX\nnormalization system for the clinical domain, which consists of an anchor point\nclassifier, an anchor relation classifier and a rule-based RI-TIMEX text span\nparser. We experiment with different feature sets and perform error analysis\nfor each system component. The annotation confirmed the hypotheses that we can\nsimplify the RI-TIMEXes normalization task using two multi-label classifiers.\nOur system achieves anchor point classification, anchor relation classification\nand rule-based parsing accuracy of 74.68%, 87.71% and 57.2% (82.09% under\nrelaxed matching criteria) respectively on the held-out test set of the 2012\ni2b2 temporal relation challenge. Experiments with feature sets reveals some\ninteresting findings such as the verbal tense feature does not inform the\nanchor relation classification in clinical narratives as much as the tokens\nnear the RI-TIMEX. Error analysis shows that underrepresented anchor point and\nanchor relation classes are difficult to detect. We formulate the RI-TIMEX\nnormalization problem as a pair of multi-label classification problems.\nConsidering only the RI-TIMEX extraction and normalization, the system achieves\nstatistically significant improvement over the RI-TIMEX results of the best\nsystems in the 2012 i2b2 challenge.", "published": "2015-10-16 18:35:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04972v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
