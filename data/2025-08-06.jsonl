We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours.

We propose\nusing a model order reduction approach, the dynamical low-rank approximation\n(DLRA), which evolves the solution on the manifold of low-rank matrices in\n(pseudo-)time. For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear\nBoltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation. We treat the uncollided\npart using a ray-tracer and combine high-order phase space discretizations and\na mixture model for materials with DLRA for the collided equation.

Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are\nconcentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based\ntechniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these\nmethods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between\nmodalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity\nacross domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in\nmultimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,\nrobustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual\nfactors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of\nrecommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized\nevaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research.

This\nframework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into\nbeneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The\nfundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the\ntrue sources of information.

For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,\nARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to\nensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious\ncorrelations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso\nmight have incorrectly omitted.

To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients.

To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,\nOmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create\nscenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine\ncross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal\nmodels reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on\nhigh-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges\nrequiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this\nfragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic\nperformance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive\n\"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically\nimprove performance.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection.

While the RTF vector of the first source can be\nestimated straightforwardly, the main challenge arises in estimating the RTF\nvectors of subsequent sources during segments where multiple sources are\nsimultaneously active. The blind oblique projection (BOP) method has been\nproposed to estimate the RTF vector of a newly activating source by optimally\nblocking this source.
