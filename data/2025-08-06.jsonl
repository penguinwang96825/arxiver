We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours.

We propose\nusing a model order reduction approach, the dynamical low-rank approximation\n(DLRA), which evolves the solution on the manifold of low-rank matrices in\n(pseudo-)time. For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear\nBoltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation. We treat the uncollided\npart using a ray-tracer and combine high-order phase space discretizations and\na mixture model for materials with DLRA for the collided equation.

{"title": "Efficient Scaling for LLM-based ASR", "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) achieves\nstrong performance but often incurs high computational costs. This work\ninvestigates how to obtain the best LLM-ASR performance efficiently. Through\ncomprehensive and controlled experiments, we find that pretraining the speech\nencoder before integrating it with the LLM leads to significantly better\nscaling efficiency than the standard practice of joint post-training of\nLLM-ASR. Based on this insight, we propose a new multi-stage LLM-ASR training\nstrategy, EFIN: Encoder First Integration. Among all training strategies\nevaluated, EFIN consistently delivers better performance (relative to 21.1%\nCERR) with significantly lower computation budgets (49.9% FLOPs). Furthermore,\nwe derive a scaling law that approximates ASR error rates as a computation\nfunction, providing practical guidance for LLM-ASR scaling.", "published": "2025-08-06 05:28:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04096v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "MiDashengLM: Efficient Audio Understanding with General Audio Captions", "abstract": "Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on\nclosed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and\naccessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language\nmodel designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the\nuse of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset.\nMiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At\nits core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder,\nspecifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively.\nUnlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nbased audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions,\nfusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation,\nenabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly,\nMiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT)\nand up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models.
