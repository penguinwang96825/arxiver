{"title": "High-Frequency Options Trading | With Portfolio Optimization", "abstract": "This paper explores the effectiveness of high-frequency options trading\nstrategies enhanced by advanced portfolio optimization techniques,\ninvestigating their ability to consistently generate positive returns compared\nto traditional long or short positions on options. Utilizing SPY options data\nrecorded in five-minute intervals over a one-month period, we calculate key\nmetrics such as Option Greeks and implied volatility, applying the Binomial\nTree model for American options pricing and the Newton-Raphson algorithm for\nimplied volatility calculation. Investment universes are constructed based on\ncriteria like implied volatility and Greeks, followed by the application of\nvarious portfolio optimization models, including Standard Mean-Variance and\nRobust Methods. Our research finds that while basic long-short strategies\ncentered on implied volatility and Greeks generally underperform, more\nsophisticated strategies incorporating advanced Greeks, such as Vega and Rho,\nalong with dynamic portfolio optimization, show potential in effectively\nnavigating the complexities of the options market. The study highlights the\nimportance of adaptability and responsiveness in dynamic portfolio strategies\nwithin the high-frequency trading environment, particularly under volatile\nmarket conditions. Future research could refine strategy parameters and explore\nless frequently traded options, offering new insights into high-frequency\noptions trading and portfolio management.", "published": "2024-08-16 17:49:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08866v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
