{"title": "Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting", "abstract": "Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,\nrendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven\nbenchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared\nwith baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nfoundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support\nclinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR\ndata into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We\nintroduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that\nnatively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and\nfuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a\nLLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,\nwhere it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while\nalso performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction\n(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for\nclinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day\nreadmission).

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors.

While many methods assume overlapping users or\nitems to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.\nThus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are\nneeded.\n  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of\noverlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional\ndiscrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders\nrepresent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their\nfine-grained, multi-faceted nature.\n  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a\nframework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared\nPreprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users\nand items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user\npreferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain\nRating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across\ndomains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.\n  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates\ndomain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the\nnon-overlapping CDR setting.", "published": "2025-08-22 08:32:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16210v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}

YANNs provide an interpretable neural\nnetwork which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of\narbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic\nsubdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit\nsolutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,\nwe propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which\nenables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of\nlinear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the\nmulti-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an\napproximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form\nof the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward\nfunction as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional\nnetwork layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which\ncan be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear\nsystem. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly\nrepresent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution\nof a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented\nto provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an\neffective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is\ndemonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive\nsystem. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL\nalgorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering\nsafety constraints.", "published": "2025-08-22 15:42:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16474v1", "categories": ["eess.SY", "cs.LG", "cs.SY", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "eess.SY"}

{"title": "Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models", "abstract": "The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to\nunderstand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized.\nRecent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have\nshown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a\nparallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield\ndramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the\ndifficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger\nadoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship\nbetween the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its\ncorresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a\nsystem, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence\nfuture behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for\nevaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in\n$O((\\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement\nover the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or\nunpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that\nparallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful.
