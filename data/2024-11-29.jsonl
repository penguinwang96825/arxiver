{"title": "Capital Asset Pricing Model with Size Factor and Normalizing by Volatility Index", "abstract": "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates a well-diversified stock\nportfolio to a benchmark portfolio. We insert size effect in CAPM, capturing\nthe observation that small stocks have higher risk and return than large\nstocks, on average. Dividing stock index returns by the Volatility Index makes\nthem independent and normal. In this article, we combine these ideas to create\na new discrete-time model, which includes volatility, relative size, and CAPM.\nWe fit this model using real-world data, prove the long-term stability, and\nconnect this research to Stochastic Portfolio Theory. We fill important gaps in\nour previous article on CAPM with the size factor.", "published": "2024-11-29 03:03:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19444v3", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR", "q-fin.ST", "60G50, 62J05, 62M10, 62P05, 91G15"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Ergodic optimal liquidations in DeFi", "abstract": "We address the liquidation problem arising from the credit risk management in\ndecentralised finance (DeFi) by formulating it as an ergodic optimal control\nproblem. In decentralised derivatives exchanges, liquidation is triggered\nwhenever the parties fail to maintain sufficient collateral for their open\npositions. Consequently, effectively managing and liquidating disposal of\npositions accrued through liquidations is a critical concern for decentralised\nderivatives exchanges. By simplifying the model (linear temporary and permanent\nprice impacts, simplified cash balance dynamics), we derive the closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal liquidation strategies, which balance immediate\nexecutions with the temporary and permanent price impacts, and the optimal\nlong-term average reward. Numerical simulations further highlight the\neffectiveness of the proposed optimal strategy and demonstrate that the\nsimplified model closely approximates the original market environment. Finally,\nwe provide the method for calibrating the parameters in the model from the\navailable data.", "published": "2024-11-29 11:39:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19637v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "math.OC", "Primary 93E20, Secondary 91G80"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
