{"title": "A Survey of Quantum Theory Inspired Approaches to Information Retrieval", "abstract": "Since 2004, researchers have been using the mathematical framework of Quantum Theory (QT) in Information Retrieval (IR). QT offers a generalized probability and logic framework. Such a framework has been shown capable of unifying the representation, ranking and user cognitive aspects of IR, and helpful in developing more dynamic, adaptive and context-aware IR systems. Although Quantum-inspired IR is still a growing area, a wide array of work in different aspects of IR has been done and produced promising results. This paper presents a survey of the research done in this area, aiming to show the landscape of the field and draw a road-map of future directions.", "published": "2020-07-08 18:24:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04357v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
