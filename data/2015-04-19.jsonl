{"title": "Gradual Classical Logic for Attributed Objects - Extended in\n  Re-Presentation", "abstract": "Our understanding about things is conceptual. By stating that we reason about\nobjects, it is in fact not the objects but concepts referring to them that we\nmanipulate. Now, so long just as we acknowledge infinitely extending notions\nsuch as space, time, size, colour, etc, - in short, any reasonable quality -\ninto which an object is subjected, it becomes infeasible to affirm atomicity in\nthe concept referring to the object. However, formal/symbolic logics typically\npresume atomic entities upon which other expressions are built. Can we reflect\nour intuition about the concept onto formal/symbolic logics at all? I assure\nthat we can, but the usual perspective about the atomicity needs inspected. In\nthis work, I present gradual logic which materialises the observation that we\ncannot tell apart whether a so-regarded atomic entity is atomic or is just\natomic enough not to be considered non-atomic. The motivation is to capture\ncertain phenomena that naturally occur around concepts with attributes,\nincluding presupposition and contraries. I present logical particulars of the\nlogic, which is then mapped onto formal semantics. Two linguistically\ninteresting semantics will be considered. Decidability is shown.", "published": "2015-04-19 07:03:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04802v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Compression and the origins of Zipf's law of abbreviation", "abstract": "Languages across the world exhibit Zipf's law of abbreviation, namely more\nfrequent words tend to be shorter. The generalized version of the law - an\ninverse relationship between the frequency of a unit and its magnitude - holds\nalso for the behaviours of other species and the genetic code. The apparent\nuniversality of this pattern in human language and its ubiquity in other\ndomains calls for a theoretical understanding of its origins. To this end, we\ngeneralize the information theoretic concept of mean code length as a mean\nenergetic cost function over the probability and the magnitude of the types of\nthe repertoire. We show that the minimization of that cost function and a\nnegative correlation between probability and the magnitude of types are\nintimately related.", "published": "2015-04-19 20:57:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04884v3", "categories": ["cs.IT", "cs.CL", "cs.SI", "math.IT", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}
