{"title": "An Unsupervised Approach for Aspect Category Detection Using Soft Cosine\n  Similarity Measure", "abstract": "Aspect category detection is one of the important and challenging subtasks of\naspect-based sentiment analysis. Given a set of pre-defined categories, this\ntask aims to detect categories which are indicated implicitly or explicitly in\na given review sentence. Supervised machine learning approaches perform well to\naccomplish this subtask. Note that, the performance of these methods depends on\nthe availability of labeled train data, which is often difficult and costly to\nobtain. Besides, most of these supervised methods require feature engineering\nto perform well. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to address\naspect category detection task without the need for any feature engineering.\nOur method utilizes clusters of unlabeled reviews and soft cosine similarity\nmeasure to accomplish aspect category detection task. Experimental results on\nSemEval-2014 restaurant dataset shows that proposed unsupervised approach\noutperforms several baselines by a substantial margin.", "published": "2018-12-08 18:11:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03361v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Political Popularity Analysis in Social Media", "abstract": "Popularity is a critical success factor for a politician and her/his party to\nwin in elections and implement their plans. Finding the reasons behind the\npopularity can provide a stable political movement. This research attempts to\nmeasure popularity in Twitter using a mixed method. In recent years, Twitter\ndata has provided an excellent opportunity for exploring public opinions by\nanalyzing a large number of tweets. This study has collected and examined 4.5\nmillion tweets related to a US politician, Senator Bernie Sanders. This study\ninvestigated eight economic reasons behind the senator's popularity in Twitter.\nThis research has benefits for politicians, informatics experts, and\npolicymakers to explore public opinion. The collected data will also be\navailable for further investigation.", "published": "2018-12-08 03:17:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03258v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
{"title": "An Exploratory Study of (#)Exercise in the Twittersphere", "abstract": "Social media analytics allows us to extract, analyze, and establish semantic\nfrom user-generated contents in social media platforms. This study utilized a\nmixed method including a three-step process of data collection, topic modeling,\nand data annotation for recognizing exercise related patterns. Based on the\nfindings, 86% of the detected topics were identified as meaningful topics after\nconducting the data annotation process. The most discussed exercise-related\ntopics were physical activity (18.7%), lifestyle behaviors (6.6%), and dieting\n(4%). The results from our experiment indicate that the exploratory data\nanalysis is a practical approach to summarizing the various characteristics of\ntext data for different health and medical applications.", "published": "2018-12-08 03:21:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03260v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
{"title": "Estimates of the Reconstruction Error in Partially Redressed Warped\n  Frames Expansions", "abstract": "In recent work, redressed warped frames have been introduced for the analysis\nand synthesis of audio signals with non-uniform frequency and time resolutions.\nIn these frames, the allocation of frequency bands or time intervals of the\nelements of the representation can be uniquely described by means of a warping\nmap. Inverse warping applied after time-frequency sampling provides the key to\nreduce or eliminate dispersion of the warped frame elements in the conjugate\nvariable, making it possible, e.g., to construct frequency warped frames with\nsynchronous time alignment through frequency. The redressing procedure is\nhowever exact only when the analysis and synthesis windows have compact support\nin the domain where warping is applied. This implies that frequency warped\nframes cannot have compact support in the time domain. This property is\nundesirable when online computation is required. Approximations in which the\ntime support is finite are however possible, which lead to small reconstruction\nerrors. In this paper we study the approximation error for compactly supported\nfrequency warped analysis-synthesis elements, providing a few examples and case\nstudies.", "published": "2018-12-08 07:58:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03279v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS", "math.NA"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
