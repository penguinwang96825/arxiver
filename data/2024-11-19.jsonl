{"title": "Risk-Neutral Pricing Model of Uniswap Liquidity Providing Position: A Stopping Time Approach", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel pricing model for Uniswap V3, built upon\nstochastic processes and the Martingale Stopping Theorem. This model\ninnovatively frames the valuation of positions within Uniswap V3. We further\nconduct a numerical analysis and examine the sensitivities through Greek risk\nmeasures to elucidate the model's implications. The results underscore the\nmodel's significant academic contribution and its practical applicability for\nUniswap liquidity providers, particularly in assessing risk exposure and\nguiding hedging strategies.", "published": "2024-11-19 09:49:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12375v3", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}

This article proposes total administrative cost as\npercentage of total tax revenue as a vivid measurand, also useful for\ncross-jurisdiction comparisons. Statistical data, surveys and a novel approach\ndemonstrate: Germany's 2021 tax administrative costs likely exceeded 20% of\ntotal tax revenue, indicating need for improvement of Germany's taxation system\n- and for the many jurisdictions with similar tax regimes. In addition, this\narticle outlines possible reasons for and implications of the seemingly high\ntax administrative burden as well as solutions.", "published": "2024-11-19 14:48:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12543v1", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.ST", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "econ.GN"}
{"title": "A Full-History Network Dataset for BTC Asset Decentralization Profiling", "abstract": "Since its advent in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) has garnered increasing attention\nfrom both academia and industry. However, due to the massive transaction\nvolume, no systematic study has quantitatively measured the asset\ndecentralization degree specifically from a network perspective.\n  In this paper, by conducting a thorough analysis of the BTC transaction\nnetwork, we first address the significant gap in the availability of\nfull-history BTC graph and network property dataset, which spans over 15 years\nfrom the genesis block (1st March, 2009) to the 845651-th block (29, May 2024).\nWe then present the first systematic investigation to profile BTC's asset\ndecentralization and design several decentralization degrees for\nquantification. Through extensive experiments, we emphasize the significant\nrole of network properties and our network-based decentralization degree in\nenhancing Bitcoin analysis. Our findings demonstrate the importance of our\ncomprehensive dataset and analysis in advancing research on Bitcoin's\ntransaction dynamics and decentralization, providing valuable insights into the\nnetwork's structure and its implications.", "published": "2024-11-19 10:55:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13603v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}

Classify-and-Rethink: Multi-Step Zero-Shot Reasoning in the Gold Investment", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success recently,\ndisplaying exceptional capabilities in creating understandable and organized\ntext. These LLMs have been utilized in diverse fields, such as clinical\nresearch, where domain-specific models like Med-Palm have achieved human-level\nperformance. Recently, researchers have employed advanced prompt engineering to\nenhance the general reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the remarkable success\nof zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) in solving general reasoning tasks, the\npotential of these methods still remains paid limited attention in the\nfinancial reasoning task.To address this issue, we explore multiple prompt\nstrategies and incorporated semantic news information to improve LLMs'\nperformance on financial reasoning tasks.To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to explore this important issue by applying ChatGPT to the gold\ninvestment.In this work, our aim is to investigate the financial reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs and their capacity to generate logical and persuasive\ninvestment opinions. We will use ChatGPT, one of the most powerful LLMs\nrecently, and prompt engineering to achieve this goal. Our research will focus\non understanding the ability of LLMs in sophisticated analysis and reasoning\nwithin the context of investment decision-making. Our study finds that ChatGPT\nwith CoT prompt can provide more explainable predictions and overcome\nbehavioral biases, which is crucial in finance-related tasks and can achieve\nhigher investment returns.", "published": "2024-11-19 07:45:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13599v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
