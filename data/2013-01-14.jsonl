{"title": "SpeedRead: A Fast Named Entity Recognition Pipeline", "abstract": "Online content analysis employs algorithmic methods to identify entities in\nunstructured text. Both machine learning and knowledge-base approaches lie at\nthe foundation of contemporary named entities extraction systems. However, the\nprogress in deploying these approaches on web-scale has been been hampered by\nthe computational cost of NLP over massive text corpora. We present SpeedRead\n(SR), a named entity recognition pipeline that runs at least 10 times faster\nthan Stanford NLP pipeline. This pipeline consists of a high performance Penn\nTreebank- compliant tokenizer, close to state-of-art part-of-speech (POS)\ntagger and knowledge-based named entity recognizer.", "published": "2013-01-14 04:01:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2857v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
