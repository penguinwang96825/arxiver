{"title": "Binary Tree based Chinese Word Segmentation", "abstract": "Chinese word segmentation is a fundamental task for Chinese language\nprocessing. The granularity mismatch problem is the main cause of the errors.\nThis paper showed that the binary tree representation can store outputs with\ndifferent granularity. A binary tree based framework is also designed to\novercome the granularity mismatch problem. There are two steps in this\nframework, namely tree building and tree pruning. The tree pruning step is\nspecially designed to focus on the granularity problem. Previous work for\nChinese word segmentation such as the sequence tagging can be easily employed\nin this framework. This framework can also provide quantitative error analysis\nmethods. The experiments showed that after using a more sophisticated tree\npruning function for a state-of-the-art conditional random field based\nbaseline, the error reduction can be up to 20%.", "published": "2013-05-17 05:14:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3981v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
