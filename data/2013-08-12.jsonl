{"title": "B(eo)W(u)LF: Facilitating recurrence analysis on multi-level language", "abstract": "Discourse analysis may seek to characterize not only the overall composition\nof a given text but also the dynamic patterns within the data. This technical\nreport introduces a data format intended to facilitate multi-level\ninvestigations, which we call the by-word long-form or B(eo)W(u)LF. Inspired by\nthe long-form data format required for mixed-effects modeling, B(eo)W(u)LF\nstructures linguistic data into an expanded matrix encoding any number of\nresearchers-specified markers, making it ideal for recurrence-based analyses.\nWhile we do not necessarily claim to be the first to use methods along these\nlines, we have created a series of tools utilizing Python and MATLAB to enable\nsuch discourse analyses and demonstrate them using 319 lines of the Old English\nepic poem, Beowulf, translated into modern English.", "published": "2013-08-12 20:57:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2696v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
