{"title": "Semantic Relation Classification via Convolutional Neural Networks with\n  Simple Negative Sampling", "abstract": "Syntactic features play an essential role in identifying relationship in a\nsentence. Previous neural network models often suffer from irrelevant\ninformation introduced when subjects and objects are in a long distance. In\nthis paper, we propose to learn more robust relation representations from the\nshortest dependency path through a convolution neural network. We further\npropose a straightforward negative sampling strategy to improve the assignment\nof subjects and objects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.", "published": "2015-06-25 07:51:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07650v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "How to improve robustness in Kohonen maps and display additional\n  information in Factorial Analysis: application to text mining", "abstract": "This article is an extended version of a paper presented in the WSOM'2012\nconference [1]. We display a combination of factorial projections, SOM\nalgorithm and graph techniques applied to a text mining problem. The corpus\ncontains 8 medieval manuscripts which were used to teach arithmetic techniques\nto merchants. Among the techniques for Data Analysis, those used for\nLexicometry (such as Factorial Analysis) highlight the discrepancies between\nmanuscripts. The reason for this is that they focus on the deviation from the\nindependence between words and manuscripts. Still, we also want to discover and\ncharacterize the common vocabulary among the whole corpus. Using the properties\nof stochastic Kohonen maps, which define neighborhood between inputs in a\nnon-deterministic way, we highlight the words which seem to play a special role\nin the vocabulary. We call them fickle and use them to improve both Kohonen map\nrobustness and significance of FCA visualization. Finally we use graph\nalgorithmic to exploit this fickleness for classification of words.", "published": "2015-06-25 12:56:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07732v1", "categories": ["math.ST", "cs.CL", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "math.ST"}
