{"title": "Counting Tree-Like Multigraphs with a Given Number of Vertices and Multiple Edges", "abstract": "The enumeration of chemical graphs is an important topic in cheminformatics\nand bioinformatics, particularly in the discovery of novel drugs. These graphs\nare typically either tree-like multigraphs or composed of tree-like multigraphs\nconnected to a core structure. In both cases, the tree-like components play a\nsignificant role in determining the properties and activities of chemical\ncompounds. This paper introduces a method based on dynamic programming to\nefficiently count tree-like multigraphs with a given number $n$ of vertices and\n$\\Delta$ multiple edges. The idea of our method is to consider multigraphs as\nrooted multigraphs by selecting their unicentroid or bicentroid as the root,\nand define their canonical representation based on maximal subgraphs rooted at\nthe children of the root. This representation guarantees that our proposed\nmethod will not repeat a multigraph in the counting process. Finally, recursive\nrelations are derived based on the number of vertices and multiple edges in the\nmaximal subgraphs rooted at the children of roots. These relations lead to an\nalgorithm with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2(n + \\Delta (n + \\Delta^2\n\\cdot \\min\\{n, \\Delta\\})))$ and a space complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2(\\Delta^3+1))$. Experimental results show that the proposed\nalgorithm efficiently counts the desired multigraphs with up to 170 vertices\nand 50 multiple edges in approximately 930 seconds, confirming its\neffectiveness and potential as a valuable tool for exploring the chemical graph\nspace in novel drug discovery.", "published": "2025-02-08 11:23:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05529v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}

By employing a\ncombinatorial optimization problem, one can ascertain optimal paths within\ndirected graphs, thereby facilitating the efficient identification of\nprofitable trading routes. This research investigates the methodologies of\nquantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing in relation to the currency\narbitrage problem. In this study, we implement the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA) utilizing Qiskit version 1.2. In order to\noptimize the parameters of QAOA, we perform simulations utilizing the\nAerSimulator and carry out experiments in simulation. Furthermore, we present\nan NchooseK-based methodology utilizing D-Wave's Ocean suite. This methodology\nenables a comparison of the effectiveness of quantum techniques in identifying\noptimal arbitrage paths.
