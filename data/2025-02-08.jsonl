{"title": "Currency Arbitrage Optimization using Quantum Annealing, QAOA and Constraint Mapping", "abstract": "Currency arbitrage capitalizes on price discrepancies in currency exchange\nrates between markets to produce profits with minimal risk. By employing a\ncombinatorial optimization problem, one can ascertain optimal paths within\ndirected graphs, thereby facilitating the efficient identification of\nprofitable trading routes. This research investigates the methodologies of\nquantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing in relation to the currency\narbitrage problem. In this study, we implement the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA) utilizing Qiskit version 1.2. In order to\noptimize the parameters of QAOA, we perform simulations utilizing the\nAerSimulator and carry out experiments in simulation. Furthermore, we present\nan NchooseK-based methodology utilizing D-Wave's Ocean suite. This methodology\nenables a comparison of the effectiveness of quantum techniques in identifying\noptimal arbitrage paths. The results of our study enhance the existing\nliterature on the application of quantum computing in financial optimization\nchallenges, emphasizing both the prospective benefits and the present\nlimitations of these developing technologies in real-world scenarios.", "published": "2025-02-08 01:22:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15742v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.OC", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
