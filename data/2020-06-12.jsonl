{"title": "Continuous Control for Searching and Planning with a Learned Model", "abstract": "Decision-making agents with planning capabilities have achieved huge success in the challenging domain like Chess, Shogi, and Go. In an effort to generalize the planning ability to the more general tasks where the environment dynamics are not available to the agent, researchers proposed the MuZero algorithm that can learn the dynamical model through the interactions with the environment. In this paper, we provide a way and the necessary theoretical results to extend the MuZero algorithm to more generalized environments with continuous action space. Through numerical results on two relatively low-dimensional MuJoCo environments, we show the proposed algorithm outperforms the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm.", "published": "2020-06-12 19:10:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07430v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "A New Perspective on Learning Context-Specific Independence", "abstract": "Local structure such as context-specific independence (CSI) has received much attention in the probabilistic graphical model (PGM) literature, as it facilitates the modeling of large complex systems, as well as for reasoning with them. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on how to learn CSIs from data. We propose to first learn a functional and parameterized representation of a conditional probability table (CPT), such as a neural network. Next, we quantize this continuous function, into an arithmetic circuit representation that facilitates efficient inference. In the first step, we can leverage the many powerful tools that have been developed in the machine learning literature. In the second step, we exploit more recently-developed analytic tools from explainable AI, for the purposes of learning CSIs. Finally, we contrast our approach, empirically and conceptually, with more traditional variable-splitting approaches, that search for CSIs more explicitly.", "published": "2020-06-12 01:11:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06896v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Early Detection of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) in Retinal Fundus Images Via Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an abnormal blood vessel development in the retina of a prematurely-born infant or an infant with low birth weight. ROP is one of the leading causes for infant blindness globally. Early detection of ROP is critical to slow down and avert the progression to vision impairment caused by ROP. Yet there is limited awareness of ROP even among medical professionals. Consequently, dataset for ROP is limited if ever available, and is in general extremely imbalanced in terms of the ratio between negative images and positive ones. In this study, we formulate the problem of detecting ROP in retinal fundus images in an optimization framework, and apply state-of-art convolutional neural network techniques to solve this problem. Experimental results based on our models achieve 100 percent sensitivity, 96 percent specificity, 98 percent accuracy, and 96 percent precision. In addition, our study shows that as the network gets deeper, more significant features can be extracted for better understanding of ROP.", "published": "2020-06-12 07:04:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06968v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Potential Field Guided Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of actor-critic reinforcement learning. Firstly, we extend the actor-critic architecture to actor-critic-N architecture by introducing more critics beyond rewards. Secondly, we combine the reward-based critic with a potential-field-based critic to formulate the proposed potential field guided actor-critic reinforcement learning approach (actor-critic-2). This can be seen as a combination of the model-based gradients and the model-free gradients in policy improvement. State with large potential field often contains a strong prior information, such as pointing to the target at a long distance or avoiding collision by the side of an obstacle. In this situation, we should trust potential-field-based critic more as policy evaluation to accelerate policy improvement, where action policy tends to be guided. For example, in practical application, learning to avoid obstacles should be guided rather than learned by trial and error. State with small potential filed is often lack of information, for example, at the local minimum point or around the moving target. At this time, we should trust reward-based critic as policy evaluation more to evaluate the long-term return. In this case, action policy tends to explore. In addition, potential field evaluation can be combined with planning to estimate a better state value function. In this way, reward design can focus more on the final stage of reward, rather than reward shaping or phased reward. Furthermore, potential field evaluation can make up for the lack of communication in multi-agent cooperation problem, i.e., multi-agent each has a reward-based critic and a relative unified potential-field-based critic with prior information. Thirdly, simplified experiments on predator-prey game demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "published": "2020-06-12 03:09:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06923v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Fractional Decomposition Tree Algorithm: A tool for studying the integrality gap of Integer Programs", "abstract": "We present a new algorithm, Fractional Decomposition Tree (FDT) for finding a feasible solution for an integer program (IP) where all variables are binary. FDT runs in polynomial time and is guaranteed to find a feasible integer solution provided the integrality gap is bounded. The algorithm gives a construction for Carr and Vempala's theorem that any feasible solution to the IP's linear-programming relaxation, when scaled by the instance integrality gap, dominates a convex combination of feasible solutions. FDT is also a tool for studying the integrality gap of IP formulations. We demonstrate that with experiments studying the integrality gap of two problems: optimally augmenting a tree to a 2-edge-connected graph and finding a minimum-cost 2-edge-connected multi-subgraph (2EC). We also give a simplified algorithm, Dom2IP, that more quickly determines if an instance has an unbounded integrality gap. We show that FDT's speed and approximation quality compare well to that of feasibility pump on moderate-sized instances of the vertex cover problem. For a particular set of hard-to-decompose fractional 2EC solutions, FDT always gave a better integer solution than the best previous approximation algorithm (Christofides).", "published": "2020-06-12 05:59:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06957v2", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Learning Effective Representations for Person-Job Fit by Feature Fusion", "abstract": "Person-job fit is to match candidates and job posts on online recruitment platforms using machine learning algorithms. The effectiveness of matching algorithms heavily depends on the learned representations for the candidates and job posts. In this paper, we propose to learn comprehensive and effective representations of the candidates and job posts via feature fusion. First, in addition to applying deep learning models for processing the free text in resumes and job posts, which is adopted by existing methods, we extract semantic entities from the whole resume (and job post) and then learn features for them. By fusing the features from the free text and the entities, we get a comprehensive representation for the information explicitly stated in the resume and job post. Second, however, some information of a candidate or a job may not be explicitly captured in the resume or job post. Nonetheless, the historical applications including accepted and rejected cases can reveal some implicit intentions of the candidates or recruiters. Therefore, we propose to learn the representations of implicit intentions by processing the historical applications using LSTM. Last, by fusing the representations for the explicit and implicit intentions, we get a more comprehensive and effective representation for person-job fit. Experiments over 10 months real data show that our solution outperforms existing methods with a large margin. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of the fused representation. The extracted semantic entities help interpret the matching results during the case study.", "published": "2020-06-12 09:02:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07017v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}

A recent empirical comparison of nine such formulations [Do\u01e7an et al. 2016] recommends the variant proposed by Weston and Watkins (WW), despite the fact that the WW-hinge loss is not calibrated with respect to the 0-1 loss. In this work we introduce a novel discrete loss function for multiclass classification, the ordered partition loss, and prove that the WW-hinge loss is calibrated with respect to this loss. We also argue that the ordered partition loss is maximally informative among discrete losses satisfying this property. Finally, we apply our theory to justify the empirical observation made by Do\u01e7an et al. that the WW-SVM can work well even under massive label noise, a challenging setting for multiclass SVMs.", "published": "2020-06-12 17:34:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07346v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

The overall training sets have three subsets, i.e., a code-switching data set, an English (LibriSpeech) and a Mandarin data set respectively. The code-switching data are Mandarin dominated. First of all, it is found using the overall data yields worse results, and hence data selection study is necessary. Then to exploit monolingual data, we find data matching is crucial. Mandarin data is closely matched with the Mandarin part in the code-switching data, while English data is not. However, Mandarin data only helps on those utterances that are significantly Mandarin-dominated. Besides, there is a balance point, over which more monolingual data will divert the CSSR system, degrading results. Finally, we analyze the effectiveness of combining monolingual data to train a CSSR system with the HMM-DNN hybrid framework. The CSSR system can perform within-utterance code-switch recognition, but it still has a margin with the one trained on code-switching data.", "published": "2020-06-12 11:37:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07094v2", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Identification of Mesh-based Compartment Thermal Model of Power Modules", "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of temperatures in power semiconductor modules is crucial for proper thermal management of such devices. Precise prediction of temperatures allows to operate the system at the physical limit of the device avoiding undesirable over-temperatures and thus improve reliability of the module. Commonly used thermal models can be based on detailed expert knowledge of the device's physical structure or on precise and complete temperature distribution measurements. The latter approach is more often used in the industry. Recently, we have proposed a linear time invariant state-space thermal model based on a compartment representation and its identification procedure that is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm from incomplete temperature data. However, the model still requires to measure temperatures of all active elements. In this contribution, we aim to relax the need for all measurements. Therefore, we replace the previous dark gray-box approach with a structured compartment model. The structure of the model is designed by a mesh-based discretization of the physical layout of the module. All compartments are assumed to share parameters that are identified from the data of the measured elements. Temperatures of the unmeasured elements are predicted using the shared parameters. Identification of the parameters is possible only with suitable regularization due to limited amount of the data. In particular, the model tightening is accomplished by sharing parameters among compartments and by constraining the process covariance matrix of the model in this contribution. Applicability of the proposed identification procedure is discussed in terms of growing state-space and therefore speeding up of the identification algorithm is suggested. Performance of the proposed approach is tested and demonstrated on simulated data.", "published": "2020-06-12 13:23:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07166v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Wideband Modal Orthogonality: A New Approach for Broadband DOA Estimation", "abstract": "Wideband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation techniques for sensors array have been studied extensively in the literature. Nevertheless, needing prior information on the number and directions of sources or demanding heavy computational load makes most of these techniques less useful in practice. In this paper, a low complexity subspace-based framework for DOA estimation of broadband signals, named as wideband modal orthogonality (WIMO), is proposed and accordingly two DOA estimators are developed. First, a closed-form approximation of spatial-temporal covariance matrix (STCM) in the uniform spectrum case is presented. The eigenvectors of STCM associated with non-zero eigenvalues are modal components of the wideband source in a given bandwidth and direction. WIMO idea is to extract these eigenvectors at desired DOAs from the approximated STCM and test their orthogonality to estimated noise subspace. In the non-uniform spectrum case, WIMO idea can be applied by approximating STCM through numerical integration. Fortunately, STCM approximation and modal extraction can be performed offline. WIMO provides DOA estimation without the conventional prerequisites, such as spectral decomposition, focusing procedure and, a priori information on the number of sources and their DOAs. Several numerical examples are conducted to compare the WIMO performance with the state-of-the-art methods. Simulations demonstrate that the two proposed DOA estimators achieve superior performance in terms of probability of resolution and estimation error along with orders of magnitude runtime speedup.", "published": "2020-06-12 15:17:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07261v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

{"title": "Performance Analysis of Relay-Assisted OWC Over Foggy Channel with Pointing Error", "abstract": "Signal fading due to atmospheric channel impairments and pointing error is a major bottleneck for the performance of optical wireless communication (OWC). In this paper, we consider an amplify-and-forward (AF) optical relaying to enhance the performance of the OWC system with a negligible line-of-sight (LOS) link under the combined effect of fog and pointing error. We analyze the end-to-end performance of the relay-assisted system, which consists of complicated probability distribution functions. We derive analytical expressions of the outage probability, average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and ergodic rate in terms of OWC system parameters. We also develop an exact integral-form expression of these performance metrics using the half-harmonic mean of individual SNRs to validate the tightness of the derived analytical expressions. The numerical and simulation analysis shows that the proposed dual-hop relaying has significant performance improvement when comparing to the direct transmission over considered channel impairments. Compared to the direct transmission, the relay-assisted system requires almost $30$ times less transmission power to achieve the same outage probability. The considered system also provides a significant gain in the average SNR and ergodic rate for practical scenarios of OWC deployment.", "published": "2020-06-12 12:04:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07105v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
