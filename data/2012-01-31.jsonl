{"title": "A Random Matrix Approach to Dynamic Factors in macroeconomic data", "abstract": "We show how random matrix theory can be applied to develop new algorithms to extract dynamic factors from macroeconomic time series. In particular, we consider a limit where the number of random variables N and the number of consecutive time measurements T are large but the ratio N / T is fixed. In this regime the underlying random matrices are asymptotically equivalent to Free Random Variables (FRV).Application of these methods for macroeconomic indicators for Poland economy is also presented.", "published": "2012-01-31 14:11:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6544v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "physics.comp-ph", "physics.data-an", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
