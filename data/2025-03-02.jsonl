{"title": "Soft Barycentric Refinement", "abstract": "The soft Barycentric refinement preserves manifolds with or without boundary.\nIn every dimension larger than one, there is a universal spectral central\nlimiting measure that has affinities with the Barycentric limiting measure one\ndimension lower. Ricci type quantities like the length of the dual sphere of\nco-dimension-2 simplex stay invariant under soft refinements. We prove that the\ndual graphs of any manifold can be colored with 3 colors, which is in the\n2-dimensional case a special case of the Groetzsch theorem. It follows that the\nvertices of a soft Barycentric refined q-manifold G' can be colored by q+1 or\nq+2 colors.", "published": "2025-03-02 14:21:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00909v1", "categories": ["math.CO", "cs.DM", "05C15, 05C50, 15-xx"], "primary_category": "math.CO"}

{"title": "Interval H-graphs : Recognition and forbidden obstructions", "abstract": "We introduce the class of interval $H$-graphs, which is the generalization of\ninterval graphs, particularly interval bigraphs. For a fixed graph $H$ with\nvertices $a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_k$, we say that an input graph $G$ with given\npartition $V_1,\\dots,V_k$ of its vertices is an interval $H$-graph if each\nvertex $v \\in G$ can be represented by an interval $I_v$ from a real line so\nthat $u \\in V_i$ and $v \\in V_j$ are adjacent if and only if $a_ia_j$ is an\nedge of $H$ and intervals $I_u$ and $I_v$ intersect. $G$ is called interval\n$k$-graph if $H$ is a complete graph on $k$ vertices. and interval bigraph when\n$k=2$. We study the ordering characterization and forbidden obstructions of\ninterval $k$-graphs and present a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for\nthem. Additionally, we discuss how this algorithm can be extended to recognize\ngeneral interval $H$-graphs. Special cases of interval $k$-graphs, particularly\ncomparability interval $k$-graphs, were previously studied in [2], where the\ncomplexity interval $k$-graph recognition was posed as an open problem.", "published": "2025-03-02 00:10:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00672v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.DS", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}

In particular, we give an algorithm for pricing the American options\ncapped by the first drawdown epoch. We focus on the geometric L\\'evy market.

We\ndemonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for\ncryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and\nreduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility.
