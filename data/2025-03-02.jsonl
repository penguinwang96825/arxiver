{"title": "Pricing time-capped American options using Least Squares Monte Carlo method", "abstract": "In this paper, we adopt the least squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method to price\ntime-capped American options. The aforementioned cap can be an independent\nrandom variable or dependent on asset price at random time. We allow various\ntime caps. In particular, we give an algorithm for pricing the American options\ncapped by the first drawdown epoch. We focus on the geometric L\\'evy market. We\nprove that our estimator converges to the true price as one takes the\ndiscretisation step tending to zero and the number of trajectories going to\ninfinity.", "published": "2025-03-02 22:07:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01040v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Liquidity-adjusted Return and Volatility, and Autoregressive Models", "abstract": "We construct liquidity-adjusted return and volatility using purposely\ndesigned liquidity metrics (liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion) that\nincorporate additional liquidity information. Based on these measures, we\nintroduce a liquidity-adjusted ARMA-GARCH framework to address the limitations\nof traditional ARMA-GARCH models, which are not effectively in modeling\nilliquid assets with high liquidity variability, such as cryptocurrencies. We\ndemonstrate that the liquidity-adjusted model improves model fit for\ncryptocurrencies, with greater volatility sensitivity to past shocks and\nreduced volatility persistence of erratic past volatility. Our model is\nvalidated by the empirical evidence that the liquidity-adjusted mean-variance\n(LAMV) portfolios outperform the traditional mean-variance (TMV) portfolios.", "published": "2025-03-02 13:53:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08693v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
