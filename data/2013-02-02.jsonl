{"title": "Lambek vs. Lambek: Functorial Vector Space Semantics and String Diagrams\n  for Lambek Calculus", "abstract": "The Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) model is a\nmathematical framework that provides compositional semantics for meanings of\nnatural language sentences. It consists of a computational procedure for\nconstructing meanings of sentences, given their grammatical structure in terms\nof compositional type-logic, and given the empirically derived meanings of\ntheir words. For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled\nwithin a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions,\nderived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically\nvalidated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success\ncan be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by\nintegrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of\nmeaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework.\n  The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar.\nPregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in\na functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces,\nlinear maps and tensor product. The diagrammatic versions of the equational\nreasoning in compact closed categories can be interpreted as the flow of word\nmeanings within sentences. Pregroups simplify Lambek's previous type-logic, the\nLambek calculus, which has been extensively used to formalise and reason about\nvarious linguistic phenomena. The apparent reliance of the DisCoCat on\npregroups has been seen as a shortcoming. This paper addresses this concern, by\npointing out that one may as well realise a functorial passage from the\noriginal type-logic of Lambek, a monoidal bi-closed category, to vector spaces,\nor to any other model of meaning organised within a monoidal bi-closed\ncategory. The corresponding string diagram calculus, due to Baez and Stay, now\ndepicts the flow of word meanings.", "published": "2013-02-02 15:57:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0393v1", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.CL", "math.CT", "16B50, 18A10, 68T50", "G.1.3; F.4.1; F.4.2; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
