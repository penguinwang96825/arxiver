{"title": "Estimating Confusions in the ASR Channel for Improved Topic-based\n  Language Model Adaptation", "abstract": "Human language is a combination of elemental languages/domains/styles that\nchange across and sometimes within discourses. Language models, which play a\ncrucial role in speech recognizers and machine translation systems, are\nparticularly sensitive to such changes, unless some form of adaptation takes\nplace. One approach to speech language model adaptation is self-training, in\nwhich a language model's parameters are tuned based on automatically\ntranscribed audio. However, transcription errors can misguide self-training,\nparticularly in challenging settings such as conversational speech. In this\nwork, we propose a model that considers the confusions (errors) of the ASR\nchannel. By modeling the likely confusions in the ASR output instead of using\njust the 1-best, we improve self-training efficacy by obtaining a more reliable\nreference transcription estimate. We demonstrate improved topic-based language\nmodeling adaptation results over both 1-best and lattice self-training using\nour ASR channel confusion estimates on telephone conversations.", "published": "2013-03-21 02:56:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5148v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
