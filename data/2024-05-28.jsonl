{"title": "A Novel Approach to Queue-Reactive Models: The Importance of Order Sizes", "abstract": "In this article, we delve into the applications and extensions of the\nqueue-reactive model for the simulation of limit order books. Our approach\nemphasizes the importance of order sizes, in conjunction with their type and\narrival rate, by integrating the current state of the order book to determine,\nnot only the intensity of order arrivals and their type, but also their sizes.\nThese extensions generate simulated markets that are in line with numerous\nstylized facts of the market. Our empirical calibration, using futures on\nGerman bonds, reveals that the extended queue-reactive model significantly\nimproves the description of order flow properties and the shape of queue\ndistributions. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the extended model\nproduces simulated markets with a volatility comparable to historical real\ndata, utilizing only endogenous information from the limit order book. This\nresearch underscores the potential of the queue-reactive model and its\nextensions in accurately simulating market dynamics and providing valuable\ninsights into the complex nature of limit order book modeling.", "published": "2024-05-28 21:14:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18594v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
