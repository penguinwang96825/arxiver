{"title": "An Approach for Text Steganography Based on Markov Chains", "abstract": "A text steganography method based on Markov chains is introduced, together\nwith a reference implementation. This method allows for information hiding in\ntexts that are automatically generated following a given Markov model. Other\nMarkov - based systems of this kind rely on big simplifications of the language\nmodel to work, which produces less natural looking and more easily detectable\ntexts. The method described here is designed to generate texts within a good\napproximation of the original language model provided.", "published": "2014-09-02 22:59:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0915v1", "categories": ["cs.MM", "cs.CL", "68P25, 94A60", "D.4.6"], "primary_category": "cs.MM"}
