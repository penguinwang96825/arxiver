{"title": "Method of Tibetan Person Knowledge Extraction", "abstract": "Person knowledge extraction is the foundation of the Tibetan knowledge graph\nconstruction, which provides support for Tibetan question answering system,\ninformation retrieval, information extraction and other researches, and\npromotes national unity and social stability. This paper proposes a SVM and\ntemplate based approach to Tibetan person knowledge extraction. Through\nconstructing the training corpus, we build the templates based the shallow\nparsing analysis of Tibetan syntactic, semantic features and verbs. Using the\ntraining corpus, we design a hierarchical SVM classifier to realize the entity\nknowledge extraction. Finally, experimental results prove the method has\ngreater improvement in Tibetan person knowledge extraction.", "published": "2016-04-11 08:56:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02843v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Using Sentence-Level LSTM Language Models for Script Inference", "abstract": "There is a small but growing body of research on statistical scripts, models\nof event sequences that allow probabilistic inference of implicit events from\ndocuments. These systems operate on structured verb-argument events produced by\nan NLP pipeline. We compare these systems with recent Recurrent Neural Net\nmodels that directly operate on raw tokens to predict sentences, finding the\nlatter to be roughly comparable to the former in terms of predicting missing\nevents in documents.", "published": "2016-04-11 15:21:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02993v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Global Features for Coreference Resolution", "abstract": "There is compelling evidence that coreference prediction would benefit from\nmodeling global information about entity-clusters. Yet, state-of-the-art\nperformance can be achieved with systems treating each mention prediction\nindependently, which we attribute to the inherent difficulty of crafting\ninformative cluster-level features. We instead propose to use recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) to learn latent, global representations of entity clusters\ndirectly from their mentions. We show that such representations are especially\nuseful for the prediction of pronominal mentions, and can be incorporated into\nan end-to-end coreference system that outperforms the state of the art without\nrequiring any additional search.", "published": "2016-04-11 17:15:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03035v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Shallow Parsing Pipeline for Hindi-English Code-Mixed Social Media Text", "abstract": "In this study, the problem of shallow parsing of Hindi-English code-mixed\nsocial media text (CSMT) has been addressed. We have annotated the data,\ndeveloped a language identifier, a normalizer, a part-of-speech tagger and a\nshallow parser. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt\nshallow parsing on CSMT. The pipeline developed has been made available to the\nresearch community with the goal of enabling better text analysis of Hindi\nEnglish CSMT. The pipeline is accessible at http://bit.ly/csmt-parser-api .", "published": "2016-04-11 20:24:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03136v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Intelligent information extraction based on artificial neural network", "abstract": "Question Answering System (QAS) is used for information retrieval and natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) to reduce human effort. There are numerous QAS based\non the user documents present today, but they all are limited to providing\nobjective answers and process simple questions only. Complex questions cannot\nbe answered by the existing QAS, as they require interpretation of the current\nand old data as well as the question asked by the user. The above limitations\ncan be overcome by using deep cases and neural network. Hence we propose a\nmodified QAS in which we create a deep artificial neural network with\nassociative memory from text documents. The modified QAS processes the contents\nof the text document provided to it and find the answer to even complex\nquestions in the documents.", "published": "2016-04-11 06:09:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09327v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Conversational flow in Oxford-style debates", "abstract": "Public debates are a common platform for presenting and juxtaposing diverging\nviews on important issues. In this work we propose a methodology for tracking\nhow ideas flow between participants throughout a debate. We use this approach\nin a case study of Oxford-style debates---a competitive format where the winner\nis determined by audience votes---and show how the outcome of a debate depends\non aspects of conversational flow. In particular, we find that winners tend to\nmake better use of a debate's interactive component than losers, by actively\npursuing their opponents' points rather than promoting their own ideas over the\ncourse of the conversation.", "published": "2016-04-11 20:00:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03114v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
