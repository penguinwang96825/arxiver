{"title": "Studying the Interplay between Information Loss and Operation Loss in Representations for Classification", "abstract": "Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation. From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings support the observation that the selection of feature representations that attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.", "published": "2021-12-30 23:17:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15238v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.IT", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Measure-valued affine and polynomial diffusions", "abstract": "We introduce a class of measure-valued processes, which -- in analogy to their finite dimensional counterparts -- will be called measure-valued polynomial diffusions. We show the so-called moment formula, i.e.~a representation of the conditional marginal moments via a system of finite dimensional linear PDEs. Furthermore, we characterize the corresponding infinitesimal generators and obtain a representation analogous to polynomial diffusions on $\\mathbb{R}^m_+$, in cases where their domain is large enough. In general the infinite dimensional setting allows for richer specifications strictly beyond this representation. As a special case we recover measure-valued affine diffusions, sometimes also called Dawson-Watanabe superprocesses. From a mathematical finance point of view the polynomial framework is especially attractive as it allows to transfer the most famous finite dimensional models, such as the Black-Scholes model, to an infinite dimensional measure-valued setting. We outline in particular the applicability of our approach for term structure modeling in energy markets.", "published": "2021-12-30 16:57:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15129v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
