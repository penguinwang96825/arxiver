{"title": "Towards Portfolios of Streamlined Constraint Models: A Case Study with the Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem", "abstract": "Augmenting a base constraint model with additional constraints can strengthen the inferences made by a solver and therefore reduce search effort. We focus on the automatic addition of streamliner constraints, derived from the types present in an abstract Essence specification of a problem class of interest, which trade completeness for potentially very significant reduction in search. The refinement of streamlined Essence specifications into constraint models suitable for input to constraint solvers gives rise to a large number of modelling choices in addition to those required for the base Essence specification. Previous automated streamlining approaches have been limited in evaluating only a single default model for each streamlined specification. In this paper we explore the effect of model selection in the context of streamlined specifications. We propose a new best-first search method that generates a portfolio of Pareto Optimal streamliner-model combinations by evaluating for each streamliner a portfolio of models to search and explore the variability in performance and find the optimal model. Various forms of racing are utilised to constrain the computational cost of training.", "published": "2020-09-21 19:48:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10152v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Federated Learning for Computational Pathology on Gigapixel Whole Slide Images", "abstract": "Deep Learning-based computational pathology algorithms have demonstrated profound ability to excel in a wide array of tasks that range from characterization of well known morphological phenotypes to predicting non-human-identifiable features from histology such as molecular alterations. However, the development of robust, adaptable, and accurate deep learning-based models often rely on the collection and time-costly curation large high-quality annotated training data that should ideally come from diverse sources and patient populations to cater for the heterogeneity that exists in such datasets. Multi-centric and collaborative integration of medical data across multiple institutions can naturally help overcome this challenge and boost the model performance but is limited by privacy concerns amongst other difficulties that may arise in the complex data sharing process as models scale towards using hundreds of thousands of gigapixel whole slide images. In this paper, we introduce privacy-preserving federated learning for gigapixel whole slide images in computational pathology using weakly-supervised attention multiple instance learning and differential privacy. We evaluated our approach on two different diagnostic problems using thousands of histology whole slide images with only slide-level labels. Additionally, we present a weakly-supervised learning framework for survival prediction and patient stratification from whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness in a federated setting. Our results show that using federated learning, we can effectively develop accurate weakly supervised deep learning models from distributed data silos without direct data sharing and its associated complexities, while also preserving differential privacy using randomized noise generation.", "published": "2020-09-21 21:56:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10190v2", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG", "q-bio.TO"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "DGTN: Dual-channel Graph Transition Network for Session-based Recommendation", "abstract": "The task of session-based recommendation is to predict user actions based on anonymous sessions. Recent research mainly models the target session as a sequence or a graph to capture item transitions within it, ignoring complex transitions between items in different sessions that have been generated by other users. These item transitions include potential collaborative information and reflect similar behavior patterns, which we assume may help with the recommendation for the target session. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely Dual-channel Graph Transition Network (DGTN), to model item transitions within not only the target session but also the neighbor sessions. Specifically, we integrate the target session and its neighbor (similar) sessions into a single graph. Then the transition signals are explicitly injected into the embedding by channel-aware propagation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DGTN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis verifies the rationality of dual-channel item transition modeling, suggesting a potential future direction for session-based recommendation.", "published": "2020-09-21 16:29:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10002v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Robust Outlier Arm Identification", "abstract": "We study the problem of Robust Outlier Arm Identification (ROAI), where the goal is to identify arms whose expected rewards deviate substantially from the majority, by adaptively sampling from their reward distributions. We compute the outlier threshold using the median and median absolute deviation of the expected rewards. This is a robust choice for the threshold compared to using the mean and standard deviation, since it can identify outlier arms even in the presence of extreme outlier values. Our setting is different from existing pure exploration problems where the threshold is pre-specified as a given value or rank. This is useful in applications where the goal is to identify the set of promising items but the cardinality of this set is unknown, such as finding promising drugs for a new disease or identifying items favored by a population. We propose two $\u03b4$-PAC algorithms for ROAI, which includes the first UCB-style algorithm for outlier detection, and derive upper bounds on their sample complexity. We also prove a matching, up to logarithmic factors, worst case lower bound for the problem, indicating that our upper bounds are generally unimprovable. Experimental results show that our algorithms are both robust and about $5$x sample efficient compared to state-of-the-art.", "published": "2020-09-21 16:13:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09988v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Open-set Short Utterance Forensic Speaker Verification using Teacher-Student Network with Explicit Inductive Bias", "abstract": "In forensic applications, it is very common that only small naturalistic datasets consisting of short utterances in complex or unknown acoustic environments are available. In this study, we propose a pipeline solution to improve speaker verification on a small actual forensic field dataset. By leveraging large-scale out-of-domain datasets, a knowledge distillation based objective function is proposed for teacher-student learning, which is applied for short utterance forensic speaker verification. The objective function collectively considers speaker classification loss, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and similarity of embeddings. In order to advance the trained deep speaker embedding network to be robust for a small target dataset, we introduce a novel strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained student model towards a forensic target domain by utilizing the model as a finetuning start point and a reference in regularization. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the 1st48-UTD forensic corpus, a newly established naturalistic dataset of actual homicide investigations consisting of short utterances recorded in uncontrolled conditions. We show that the proposed objective function can efficiently improve the performance of teacher-student learning on short utterances and that our fine-tuning strategy outperforms the commonly used weight decay method by providing an explicit inductive bias towards the pre-trained model.", "published": "2020-09-21 00:58:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09556v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
