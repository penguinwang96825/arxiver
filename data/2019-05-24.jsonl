{"title": "Content based News Recommendation via Shortest Entity Distance over Knowledge Graphs", "abstract": "Content-based news recommendation systems need to recommend news articles based on the topics and content of articles without using user specific information. Many news articles describe the occurrence of specific events and named entities including people, places or objects. In this paper, we propose a graph traversal algorithm as well as a novel weighting scheme for cold-start content based news recommendation utilizing these named entities. Seeking to create a higher degree of user-specific relevance, our algorithm computes the shortest distance between named entities, across news articles, over a large knowledge graph. Moreover, we have created a new human annotated data set for evaluating content based news recommendation systems. Experimental results show our method is suitable to tackle the hard cold-start problem and it produces stronger Pearson correlation to human similarity scores than other cold-start methods. Our method is also complementary and a combination with the conventional cold-start recommendation methods may yield significant performance gains.

{"title": "Controlling Risk of Web Question Answering", "abstract": "Web question answering (QA) has become an indispensable component in modern search systems, which can significantly improve users' search experience by providing a direct answer to users' information need. This could be achieved by applying machine reading comprehension (MRC) models over the retrieved passages to extract answers with respect to the search query. With the development of deep learning techniques, state-of-the-art MRC performances have been achieved by recent deep methods. However, existing studies on MRC seldom address the predictive uncertainty issue, i.e., how likely the prediction of an MRC model is wrong, leading to uncontrollable risks in real-world Web QA applications. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth investigation over the risk of Web QA. We then introduce a novel risk control framework, which consists of a qualify model for uncertainty estimation using the probe idea, and a decision model for selectively output. For evaluation, we introduce risk-related metrics, rather than the traditional EM and F1 in MRC, for the evaluation of risk-aware Web QA. The empirical results over both the real-world Web QA dataset and the academic MRC benchmark collection demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "published": "2019-05-24 07:55:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10077v3", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicle Service Performance: Assessing the Impact of Charging Infrastructure and Battery Capacity", "abstract": "Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are the next major evolution in urban mobility. This technology has attracted much interest of car manufacturers aiming at playing a role as transportation network companies (TNCs) in order to gain benefits per kilometer and per ride. The majority of future SAVs will most probably be electric. It is therefore important to understand how limited vehicle range and the configuration of charging infrastructure will affect the performance of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) services. We aim to explore the impacts of charging station placement, charging type (rapid charging, battery swapping) as well as vehicle range onto service efficiency and customer experience in terms of service availability and response time. We perform an agent-based simulation of SAEVs across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. The simulation process features impact assessment by considering dynamic demand responsive to the network and traffic. Research results suggest that the performance of SAEVs is strongly correlated to the charging infrastructure. Importantly, faster charging infrastructure and optimized placement of charging locations in order to minimize distances between demand hubs and charging stations result in a higher performance. Further analysis indicates the importance of dispersing charging stations across the service area and how this affects service effectiveness. The results also underline that SAEV battery capacity has to be carefully selected to avoid the overlaps between demand and charging peak times. Finally, the simulation results show that by providing battery swapping infrastructure the performance indicators of SAEV service are significantly improved.", "published": "2019-05-24 12:19:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12160v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
