{"title": "Language Heedless of Logic - Philosophy Mindful of What? Failures of\n  Distributive and Absorption Laws", "abstract": "Much of philosophical logic and all of philosophy of language make empirical\nclaims about the vernacular natural language. They presume semantics under\nwhich `and' and `or' are related by the dually paired distributive and\nabsorption laws. However, at least one of each pair of laws fails in the\nvernacular. `Implicature'-based auxiliary theories associated with the\nprogramme of H.P. Grice do not prove remedial. Conceivable alternatives that\nmight replace the familiar logics as descriptive instruments are briefly noted:\n(i) substructural logics and (ii) meaning composition in linear algebras over\nthe reals, occasionally constrained by norms of classical logic. Alternative\n(ii) locates the problem in violations of one of the idempotent laws. Reasons\nfor a lack of curiosity about elementary and easily testable implications of\nthe received theory are considered. The concept of `reflective equilibrium' is\ncritically examined for its role in reconciling normative desiderata and\ndescriptive commitments.", "published": "2014-03-14 18:53:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3668v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
