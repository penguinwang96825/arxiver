{"title": "Generating Fine-Grained Open Vocabulary Entity Type Descriptions", "abstract": "While large-scale knowledge graphs provide vast amounts of structured facts\nabout entities, a short textual description can often be useful to succinctly\ncharacterize an entity and its type. Unfortunately, many knowledge graph\nentities lack such textual descriptions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic\nmemory-based network that generates a short open vocabulary description of an\nentity by jointly leveraging induced fact embeddings as well as the dynamic\ncontext of the generated sequence of words. We demonstrate the ability of our\narchitecture to discern relevant information for more accurate generation of\ntype description by pitting the system against several strong baselines.", "published": "2018-05-27 01:58:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10564v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Convolutional neural networks for chemical-disease relation extraction\n  are improved with character-based word embeddings", "abstract": "We investigate the incorporation of character-based word representations into\na standard CNN-based relation extraction model. We experiment with two common\nneural architectures, CNN and LSTM, to learn word vector representations from\ncharacter embeddings. Through a task on the BioCreative-V CDR corpus,\nextracting relationships between chemicals and diseases, we show that models\nexploiting the character-based word representations improve on models that do\nnot use this information, obtaining state-of-the-art result relative to\nprevious neural approaches.", "published": "2018-05-27 06:25:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10586v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Reliability and Learnability of Human Bandit Feedback for\n  Sequence-to-Sequence Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We present a study on reinforcement learning (RL) from human bandit feedback\nfor sequence-to-sequence learning, exemplified by the task of bandit neural\nmachine translation (NMT). We investigate the reliability of human bandit\nfeedback, and analyze the influence of reliability on the learnability of a\nreward estimator, and the effect of the quality of reward estimates on the\noverall RL task. Our analysis of cardinal (5-point ratings) and ordinal\n(pairwise preferences) feedback shows that their intra- and inter-annotator\n$\\alpha$-agreement is comparable. Best reliability is obtained for standardized\ncardinal feedback, and cardinal feedback is also easiest to learn and\ngeneralize from. Finally, improvements of over 1 BLEU can be obtained by\nintegrating a regression-based reward estimator trained on cardinal feedback\nfor 800 translations into RL for NMT. This shows that RL is possible even from\nsmall amounts of fairly reliable human feedback, pointing to a great potential\nfor applications at larger scale.", "published": "2018-05-27 13:51:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10627v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Legal Document Retrieval using Document Vector Embeddings and Deep\n  Learning", "abstract": "Domain specific information retrieval process has been a prominent and\nongoing research in the field of natural language processing. Many researchers\nhave incorporated different techniques to overcome the technical and domain\nspecificity and provide a mature model for various domains of interest. The\nmain bottleneck in these studies is the heavy coupling of domain experts, that\nmakes the entire process to be time consuming and cumbersome. In this study, we\nhave developed three novel models which are compared against a golden standard\ngenerated via the on line repositories provided, specifically for the legal\ndomain. The three different models incorporated vector space representations of\nthe legal domain, where document vector generation was done in two different\nmechanisms and as an ensemble of the above two. This study contains the\nresearch being carried out in the process of representing legal case documents\ninto different vector spaces, whilst incorporating semantic word measures and\nnatural language processing techniques. The ensemble model built in this study,\nshows a significantly higher accuracy level, which indeed proves the need for\nincorporation of domain specific semantic similarity measures into the\ninformation retrieval process. This study also shows, the impact of varying\ndistribution of the word similarity measures, against varying document vector\ndimensions, which can lead to improvements in the process of legal information\nretrieval.", "published": "2018-05-27 20:55:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10685v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
