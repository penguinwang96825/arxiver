{"title": "Option Pricing from Wavelet-Filtered Financial Series", "abstract": "We perform wavelet decomposition of high frequency financial time series into large and small time scale components. Taking the FTSE100 index as a case study, and working with the Haar basis, it turns out that the small scale component defined by most ($\\simeq$ 99.6%) of the wavelet coefficients can be neglected for the purpose of option premium evaluation. The relevance of the hugely compressed information provided by low-pass wavelet-filtering is related to the fact that the non-gaussian statistical structure of the original financial time series is essentially preserved for expiration times which are larger than just one trading day.", "published": "2011-03-18 14:54:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3639v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "physics.data-an", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
