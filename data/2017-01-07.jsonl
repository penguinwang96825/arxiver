{"title": "Neural Machine Translation on Scarce-Resource Condition: A case-study on\n  Persian-English", "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach for Machine Translation\n(MT), and due to its success, it has absorbed the attention of many researchers\nin the field. In this paper, we study NMT model on Persian-English language\npairs, to analyze the model and investigate the appropriateness of the model\nfor scarce-resourced scenarios, the situation that exists for Persian-centered\ntranslation systems. We adjust the model for the Persian language and find the\nbest parameters and hyper parameters for two tasks: translation and\ntransliteration. We also apply some preprocessing task on the Persian dataset\nwhich yields to increase for about one point in terms of BLEU score. Also, we\nhave modified the loss function to enhance the word alignment of the model.\nThis new loss function yields a total of 1.87 point improvements in terms of\nBLEU score in the translation quality.", "published": "2017-01-07 16:27:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01854v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Structural Attention Neural Networks for improved sentiment analysis", "abstract": "We introduce a tree-structured attention neural network for sentences and\nsmall phrases and apply it to the problem of sentiment classification. Our\nmodel expands the current recursive models by incorporating structural\ninformation around a node of a syntactic tree using both bottom-up and top-down\ninformation propagation. Also, the model utilizes structural attention to\nidentify the most salient representations during the construction of the\nsyntactic tree. To our knowledge, the proposed models achieve state of the art\nperformance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.", "published": "2017-01-07 09:58:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01811v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
