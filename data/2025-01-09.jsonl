{"title": "Off-Policy Evaluation and Counterfactual Methods in Dynamic Auction Environments", "abstract": "Counterfactual estimators are critical for learning and refining policies\nusing logged data, a process known as Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE). OPE allows\nresearchers to assess new policies without costly experiments, speeding up the\nevaluation process. Online experimental methods, such as A/B tests, are\neffective but often slow, thus delaying the policy selection and optimization\nprocess.\n  In this work, we explore the application of OPE methods in the context of\nresource allocation in dynamic auction environments. Given the competitive\nnature of environments where rapid decision-making is crucial for gaining a\ncompetitive edge, the ability to quickly and accurately assess algorithmic\nperformance is essential. By utilizing counterfactual estimators as a\npreliminary step before conducting A/B tests, we aim to streamline the\nevaluation process, reduce the time and resources required for experimentation,\nand enhance confidence in the chosen policies. Our investigation focuses on the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of using these estimators to predict the outcomes\nof potential resource allocation strategies, evaluate their performance, and\nfacilitate more informed decision-making in policy selection. Motivated by the\noutcomes of our initial study, we envision an advanced analytics system\ndesigned to seamlessly and dynamically assess new resource allocation\nstrategies and policies.", "published": "2025-01-09 14:39:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05278v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Time-Varying Bidirectional Causal Relationships Between Transaction Fees and Economic Activity of Subsystems Utilizing the Ethereum Blockchain Network", "abstract": "The Ethereum blockchain network enables transaction processing and\nsmart-contract execution through levies of transaction fees, commonly known as\ngas fees. This framework mediates economic participation via a market-based\nmechanism for gas fees, permitting users to offer higher gas fees to expedite\npro-cessing. Historically, the ensuing gas fee volatility led to critical\ndisequilibria between supply and demand for block space, presenting stakeholder\nchallenges. This study examines the dynamic causal interplay between\ntransaction fees and economic subsystems leveraging the network. By utilizing\ndata related to unique active wallets and transaction volume of each subsystem\nand applying time-varying Granger causality analysis, we reveal temporal\nheterogeneity in causal relationships between economic activity and transaction\nfees across all subsystems. This includes (a) a bidirectional causal feedback\nloop between cross-blockchain bridge user activity and transaction fees, which\ndiminishes over time, potentially signaling user migration; (b) a bidirectional\nrelationship between centralized cryptocurrency exchange deposit and withdrawal\ntransaction volume and fees, indicative of increased competition for block\nspace; (c) decentralized exchange volumes causally influence fees, while fees\ncausally influence user activity, although this relationship is weakening,\npotentially due to the diminished significance of decentralized finance; (d)\nintermittent causal relationships with maximal extractable value bots; (e) fees\ncausally in-fluence non-fungible token transaction volumes; and (f) a highly\nsignificant and growing causal influence of transaction fees on stablecoin\nactivity and transaction volumes highlight its prominence.", "published": "2025-01-09 15:03:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05299v1", "categories": ["q-fin.GN", "econ.EM", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR", "91G50, 91B84, 62M10, 91G70, 91B25, 91B28, 91B82, 91G15", "J.4; H.3.5; K.4.4; J.1"], "primary_category": "q-fin.GN"}
