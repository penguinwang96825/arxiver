{"title": "Quantifying Scripts: Defining metrics of characters for quantitative and\n  descriptive analysis", "abstract": "Analysis of scripts plays an important role in paleography and in\nquantitative linguistics. Especially in the field of digital paleography\nquantitative features are much needed to differentiate glyphs. We describe an\nelaborate set of metrics that quantify qualitative information contained in\ncharacters and hence indirectly also quantify the scribal features. We broadly\ndivide the metrics into several categories and describe each individual metric\nwith its underlying qualitative significance. The metrics are largely derived\nfrom the related area of gesture design and recognition. We also propose\nseveral novel metrics. The proposed metrics are soundly grounded on the\nprinciples of handwriting production and handwriting analysis. These computed\nmetrics could serve as descriptors for scripts and also be used for comparing\nand analyzing scripts. We illustrate some quantitative analysis based on the\nproposed metrics by applying it to the paleographic evolution of the medieval\nTamil script from Brahmi. We also outline future work.", "published": "2015-01-08 16:12:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01894v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Hebrew Bible as Data: Laboratory - Sharing - Experiences", "abstract": "The systematic study of ancient texts including their production,\ntransmission and interpretation is greatly aided by the digital methods that\nstarted taking off in the 1970s. But how is that research in turn transmitted\nto new generations of researchers? We tell a story of Bible and computer across\nthe decades and then point out the current challenges: (1) finding a stable\ndata representation for changing methods of computation; (2) sharing results in\ninter- and intra-disciplinary ways, for reproducibility and\ncross-fertilization. We report recent developments in meeting these challenges.\nThe scene is the text database of the Hebrew Bible, constructed by the Eep\nTalstra Centre for Bible and Computer (ETCBC), which is still growing in detail\nand sophistication. We show how a subtle mix of computational ingredients\nenable scholars to research the transmission and interpretation of the Hebrew\nBible in new ways: (1) a standard data format, Linguistic Annotation Framework\n(LAF); (2) the methods of scientific computing, made accessible by\n(interactive) Python and its associated ecosystem. Additionally, we show how\nthese efforts have culminated in the construction of a new, publicly accessible\nsearch engine SHEBANQ, where the text of the Hebrew Bible and its underlying\ndata can be queried in a simple, yet powerful query language MQL, and where\nthose queries can be saved and shared.", "published": "2015-01-08 14:21:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01866v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
