In this work, we\nexplore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance\ngrounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method\nto train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer\ncorrectness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold\nreasoning traces or expensive annotations.

To implement these hypotheses,\nwe propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based\non bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis\nmodule deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.\nNext, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source\ndomains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole\nand metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the\nmutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor.

These\nprototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly\ndiverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this\nhypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning\nability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical\nrepresentations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for\nplanning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction\npipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;\n(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through\nProlog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems\narbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness.

We argue that the key lies in how to\neffectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the\nlow-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining\nthe extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA\nLearning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion\nmodel, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module\nto aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a\nConsistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from\ndegraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules\nand train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with\nthe temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases\nalternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent\nand detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged\ninto the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a\nsingle diffusion step.

{"title": "An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals", "abstract": "In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as\na key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and\ncommunication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS\nregularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to\nthe UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a\ntarget of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional\nURLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the\nrate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by\nevaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of\nthe URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our\nnumerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly\noutperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular,\nit achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and\nsensing constraints.", "published": "2025-06-18 01:12:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045v1", "categories": ["cs.IT", "eess.SP", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}

It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise\npolynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions\n\"$(hk)^p \\rho$ sufficiently small\" and \"$(hk)^{2p} \\rho$ sufficiently small\"\nguarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative\nerror (BRE), where $\\rho$ is the norm of the solution operator with $\\rho\\sim\nk$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be\noptimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates\nthat QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate\nthe conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and\nin the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the\nmeshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One\nnotable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or\nnontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e.\nthere is no pollution in the PML.\n  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution\nmap behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and\ndata, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays)\nthrough these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation\nrequirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the\nproperties of billiard rays through that set.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on\nsemi-implicit method for the drift component of the SDAEs.

{"title": "Enhancing eLoran Timing Accuracy via Machine Learning with Meteorological and Terrain Data", "abstract": "The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal\ninterference have increased the demand for complementary positioning,\nnavigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided\nto deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary\nPNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing\ninformation, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications,\nfinancial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of\nerror for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is\nsignal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor\n(ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions\nalong the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper,\nwe measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time\ninterval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven\nmeteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable\neLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two\nestimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing\nTD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear\nrelationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted\nlinear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from\nexpert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network\n(AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight\nmeteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay.\nExperimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the\nWLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in\nimproving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.", "published": "2025-06-18 08:18:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15235v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
