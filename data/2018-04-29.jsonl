{"title": "Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation Models with\n  Multiple Subword Candidates", "abstract": "Subword units are an effective way to alleviate the open vocabulary problems\nin neural machine translation (NMT). While sentences are usually converted into\nunique subword sequences, subword segmentation is potentially ambiguous and\nmultiple segmentations are possible even with the same vocabulary. The question\naddressed in this paper is whether it is possible to harness the segmentation\nambiguity as a noise to improve the robustness of NMT. We present a simple\nregularization method, subword regularization, which trains the model with\nmultiple subword segmentations probabilistically sampled during training. In\naddition, for better subword sampling, we propose a new subword segmentation\nalgorithm based on a unigram language model. We experiment with multiple\ncorpora and report consistent improvements especially on low resource and\nout-of-domain settings.", "published": "2018-04-29 16:13:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10959v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Tree Search Algorithm for Sequence Labeling", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel reinforcement learning based model for\nsequence tagging, referred to as MM-Tag. Inspired by the success and\nmethodology of the AlphaGo Zero, MM-Tag formalizes the problem of sequence\ntagging with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) enhanced Markov decision process\n(MDP) model, in which the time steps correspond to the positions of words in a\nsentence from left to right, and each action corresponds to assign a tag to a\nword. Two long short-term memory networks (LSTM) are used to summarize the past\ntag assignments and words in the sentence. Based on the outputs of LSTMs, the\npolicy for guiding the tag assignment and the value for predicting the whole\ntagging accuracy of the whole sentence are produced. The policy and value are\nthen strengthened with MCTS, which takes the produced raw policy and value as\ninputs, simulates and evaluates the possible tag assignments at the subsequent\npositions, and outputs a better search policy for assigning tags. A\nreinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to train the model parameters. Our\nwork is the first to apply the MCTS enhanced MDP model to the sequence tagging\ntask. We show that MM-Tag can accurately predict the tags thanks to the\nexploratory decision making mechanism introduced by MCTS. Experimental results\nshow based on a chunking benchmark showed that MM-Tag outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art sequence tagging baselines including CRF and CRF with LSTM.", "published": "2018-04-29 11:57:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10911v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "OPA2Vec: combining formal and informal content of biomedical ontologies\n  to improve similarity-based prediction", "abstract": "Motivation: Ontologies are widely used in biology for data annotation,\nintegration, and analysis. In addition to formally structured axioms,\nontologies contain meta-data in the form of annotation axioms which provide\nvaluable pieces of information that characterize ontology classes. Annotations\ncommonly used in ontologies include class labels, descriptions, or synonyms.\nDespite being a rich source of semantic information, the ontology meta-data are\ngenerally unexploited by ontology-based analysis methods such as semantic\nsimilarity measures. Results: We propose a novel method, OPA2Vec, to generate\nvector representations of biological entities in ontologies by combining formal\nontology axioms and annotation axioms from the ontology meta-data. We apply a\nWord2Vec model that has been pre-trained on PubMed abstracts to produce feature\nvectors from our collected data. We validate our method in two different ways:\nfirst, we use the obtained vector representations of proteins as a similarity\nmeasure to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) on two different datasets.\nSecond, we evaluate our method on predicting gene-disease associations based on\nphenotype similarity by generating vector representations of genes and diseases\nusing a phenotype ontology, and applying the obtained vectors to predict\ngene-disease associations. These two experiments are just an illustration of\nthe possible applications of our method. OPA2Vec can be used to produce vector\nrepresentations of any biomedical entity given any type of biomedical ontology.\nAvailability: https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/opa2vec Contact:\nrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa and xin.gao@kaust.edu.sa.", "published": "2018-04-29 12:49:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10922v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
