{"title": "On non-uniqueness in the option valuation problem", "abstract": "It is known that the value of a call option in the case of constant\nelasticity processes (CEV) with the indicator $\\alpha$ exceeding the critical\n$\\alpha=1$ is determined in a non-unique way.\n  We show how, based on an already existing mathematical theory concerning the\ncorrectness of boundary conditions for degenerate parabolic equations on the\nsemi-axis $[0,\\infty)$, this phenomenon can be explained. Namely, for\n$1<\\alpha\\le \\frac32$ the non-uniqueness is due to the fact that the initial\ndata of the call option are outside the T\\\"acklind class, and for $\\alpha>\n\\frac32$ it is due to the absence boundary condition for $x=\\infty$.", "published": "2025-01-30 19:50:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18721v1", "categories": ["math.AP", "q-fin.MF", "35K65 35G16 35A02"], "primary_category": "math.AP"}
