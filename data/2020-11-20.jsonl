{"title": "A Survey on Deep Learning Based Point-Of-Interest (POI) Recommendations", "abstract": "Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) enable users to socialize with friends and acquaintances by sharing their check-ins, opinions, photos, and reviews. Huge volume of data generated from LBSNs opens up a new avenue of research that gives birth to a new sub-field of recommendation systems, known as Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. A POI recommendation technique essentially exploits users' historical check-ins and other multi-modal information such as POI attributes and friendship network, to recommend the next set of POIs suitable for a user. A plethora of earlier works focused on traditional machine learning techniques by using hand-crafted features from the dataset. With the recent surge of deep learning research, we have witnessed a large variety of POI recommendation works utilizing different deep learning paradigms. These techniques largely vary in problem formulations, proposed techniques, used datasets, and features, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive survey of all major deep learning-based POI recommendation works. Our work categorizes and critically analyzes the recent POI recommendation works based on different deep learning paradigms and other relevant features. This review can be considered a cookbook for researchers or practitioners working in the area of POI recommendation.", "published": "2020-11-20 02:55:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10187v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "User and Item-aware Estimation of Review Helpfulness", "abstract": "In online review sites, the analysis of user feedback for assessing its helpfulness for decision-making is usually carried out by locally studying the properties of individual reviews. However, global properties should be considered as well to precisely evaluate the quality of user feedback. In this paper we investigate the role of deviations in the properties of reviews as helpfulness determinants with the intuition that \"out of the core\" feedback helps item evaluation. We propose a novel helpfulness estimation model that extends previous ones with the analysis of deviations in rating, length and polarity with respect to the reviews written by the same person, or concerning the same item. A regression analysis carried out on two large datasets of reviews extracted from Yelp social network shows that user-based deviations in review length and rating clearly influence perceived helpfulness. Moreover, an experiment on the same datasets shows that the integration of our helpfulness estimation model improves the performance of a collaborative recommender system by enhancing the selection of high-quality data for rating estimation. Our model is thus an effective tool to select relevant user feedback for decision-making.", "published": "2020-11-20 15:35:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10456v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
