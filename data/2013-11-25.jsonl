{"title": "Synchronous Context-Free Grammars and Optimal Linear Parsing Strategies", "abstract": "Synchronous Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs), also known as syntax-directed\ntranslation schemata, are unlike context-free grammars in that they do not have\na binary normal form. In general, parsing with SCFGs takes space and time\npolynomial in the length of the input strings, but with the degree of the\npolynomial depending on the permutations of the SCFG rules. We consider linear\nparsing strategies, which add one nonterminal at a time. We show that for a\ngiven input permutation, the problems of finding the linear parsing strategy\nwith the minimum space and time complexity are both NP-hard.", "published": "2013-11-25 19:48:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6421v1", "categories": ["cs.FL", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.FL"}
