{"title": "Context Vectors are Reflections of Word Vectors in Half the Dimensions", "abstract": "This paper takes a step towards theoretical analysis of the relationship between word embeddings and context embeddings in models such as word2vec. We start from basic probabilistic assumptions on the nature of word vectors, context vectors, and text generation. These assumptions are well supported either empirically or theoretically by the existing literature. Next, we show that under these assumptions the widely-used word-word PMI matrix is approximately a random symmetric Gaussian ensemble. This, in turn, implies that context vectors are reflections of word vectors in approximately half the dimensions. As a direct application of our result, we suggest a theoretically grounded way of tying weights in the SGNS model.", "published": "2019-02-26 11:09:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09859v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Market-Based Model in CR-WSN: A Q-Probabilistic Multi-agent Learning Approach", "abstract": "The ever-increasingly urban populations and their material demands have brought unprecedented burdens to cities. Smart cities leverage emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Network (CR-WSN) to provide better QoE and QoS for all citizens. However, resource scarcity is an important challenge in CR-WSN. Generally, this problem is handled by auction theory or game theory. To make CR-WSN nodes intelligent and more autonomous in resource allocation, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy in the oligopoly market model. Firstly, we model a multi-agent scenario, in which the primary users (PUs) is the sellers and the secondary users (SUs) is the buyers. Then, we propose the Q-probabilistic multiagent learning (QPML) and apply it to allocate resources in the market. In the multi-agent interactive learning process, the PUs and SUs learn strategies to maximize their benefits and improve spectrum utilization. Experimental results show the efficiency of our QPML approach, which can also converge quickly.", "published": "2019-02-26 01:15:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09687v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.GT"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Directional Embedding Based Semi-supervised Framework For Bird Vocalization Segmentation", "abstract": "This paper proposes a data-efficient, semi-supervised, two-pass framework for segmenting bird vocalizations. The framework utilizes a binary classification model to categorize frames of an input audio recording into the background or bird vocalization. The first pass of the framework automatically generates training labels from the input recording itself, while model training and classification is done during the second pass. The proposed framework utilizes a reference directional model for obtaining a feature representation called directional embeddings (DE). This reference directional model acts as an acoustic model for bird vocalizations and is obtained using the mixtures of Von-Mises Fisher distribution (moVMF). The proposed DE space only contains information about bird vocalizations, while no information about the background disturbances is reflected. The framework employs supervised information only for obtaining the reference directional model and avoids the background modeling. Hence, it can be regarded as semi-supervised in nature. The proposed framework is tested on approximately 79000 vocalizations of seven different bird species. The performance of the framework is also analyzed in the presence of noise at different SNRs. Experimental results convey that the proposed framework performs better than the existing bird vocalization segmentation methods.", "published": "2019-02-26 07:08:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09765v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
