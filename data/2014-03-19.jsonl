{"title": "Spelling Error Trends and Patterns in Sindhi", "abstract": "Statistical error Correction technique is the most accurate and widely used\napproach today, but for a language like Sindhi which is a low resourced\nlanguage the trained corpora's are not available, so the statistical techniques\nare not possible at all. Instead a useful alternative would be to exploit\nvarious spelling error trends in Sindhi by using a Rule based approach. For\ndesigning such technique an essential prerequisite would be to study the\nvarious error patterns in a language. This pa per presents various studies of\nspelling error trends and their types in Sindhi Language. The research shows\nthat the error trends common to all languages are also encountered in Sindhi\nbut their do exist some error patters that are catered specifically to a Sindhi\nlanguage.", "published": "2014-03-19 10:45:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4759v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Using Entropy Estimates for DAG-Based Ontologies", "abstract": "Motivation: Entropy measurements on hierarchical structures have been used in\nmethods for information retrieval and natural language modeling. Here we\nexplore its application to semantic similarity. By finding shared ontology\nterms, semantic similarity can be established between annotated genes. A common\nprocedure for establishing semantic similarity is to calculate the\ndescriptiveness (information content) of ontology terms and use these values to\ndetermine the similarity of annotations. Most often information content is\ncalculated for an ontology term by analyzing its frequency in an annotation\ncorpus. The inherent problems in using these values to model functional\nsimilarity motivates our work. Summary: We present a novel calculation for\nestablishing the entropy of a DAG-based ontology, which can be used in an\nalternative method for establishing the information content of its terms. We\nalso compare our IC metric to two others using semantic and sequence\nsimilarity.", "published": "2014-03-19 17:29:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4887v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
