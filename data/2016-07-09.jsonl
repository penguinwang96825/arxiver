{"title": "Analysis of opinionated text for opinion mining", "abstract": "In sentiment analysis, the polarities of the opinions expressed on an\nobject/feature are determined to assess the sentiment of a sentence or document\nwhether it is positive/negative/neutral. Naturally, the object/feature is a\nnoun representation which refers to a product or a component of a product, let\nus say, the \"lens\" in a camera and opinions emanating on it are captured in\nadjectives, verbs, adverbs and noun words themselves. Apart from such words,\nother meta-information and diverse effective features are also going to play an\nimportant role in influencing the sentiment polarity and contribute\nsignificantly to the performance of the system. In this paper, some of the\nassociated information/meta-data are explored and investigated in the sentiment\ntext. Based on the analysis results presented here, there is scope for further\nassessment and utilization of the meta-information as features in text\ncategorization, ranking text document, identification of spam documents and\npolarity classification problems.", "published": "2016-07-09 07:11:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02576v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
