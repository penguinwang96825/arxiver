{"title": "A Preadapted Universal Switch Distribution for Testing Hilberg's\n  Conjecture", "abstract": "Hilberg's conjecture about natural language states that the mutual\ninformation between two adjacent long blocks of text grows like a power of the\nblock length. The exponent in this statement can be upper bounded using the\npointwise mutual information estimate computed for a carefully chosen code. The\nbound is the better, the lower the compression rate is but there is a\nrequirement that the code be universal. So as to improve a received upper bound\nfor Hilberg's exponent, in this paper, we introduce two novel universal codes,\ncalled the plain switch distribution and the preadapted switch distribution.\nGenerally speaking, switch distributions are certain mixtures of adaptive\nMarkov chains of varying orders with some additional communication to avoid so\ncalled catch-up phenomenon. The advantage of these distributions is that they\nboth achieve a low compression rate and are guaranteed to be universal. Using\nthe switch distributions we obtain that a sample of a text in English is\nnon-Markovian with Hilberg's exponent being $\\le 0.83$, which improves over the\nprevious bound $\\le 0.94$ obtained using the Lempel-Ziv code.", "published": "2013-10-31 14:12:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8511v2", "categories": ["cs.IT", "cs.CL", "math.IT", "68P30, 94A45", "E.4"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}
