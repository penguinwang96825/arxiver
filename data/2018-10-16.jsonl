{"title": "How to share a cake with a secret agent", "abstract": "In this note we study a problem of fair division in the absence of full information. We give an algorithm which solves the following problem: n $\\ge$ 2 persons want to cut a cake into n shares so that each person will get at least 1/n of the cake for his or her own measure, furthermore the preferences of one person are secret. How can we construct such shares? Our algorithm is a slight modification of the Even-Paz algorithm and allows to give a connected part to each agent. Moreover, the number of cuts used during the algorithm is optimal: O (n log(n)) .", "published": "2018-10-16 10:20:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06913v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.GT"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Metropolis-Hastings view on variational inference and adversarial training", "abstract": "A significant part of MCMC methods can be considered as the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm with different proposal distributions. From this point of view, the problem of constructing a sampler can be reduced to the question - how to choose a proposal for the MH algorithm? To address this question, we propose to learn an independent sampler that maximizes the acceptance rate of the MH algorithm, which, as we demonstrate, is highly related to the conventional variational inference. For Bayesian inference, the proposed method compares favorably against alternatives to sample from the posterior distribution. Under the same approach, we step beyond the scope of classical MCMC methods and deduce the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework from scratch, treating the generator as the proposal and the discriminator as the acceptance test. On real-world datasets, we improve Frechet Inception Distance and Inception Score, using different GANs as a proposal distribution for the MH algorithm. In particular, we demonstrate improvements of recently proposed BigGAN model on ImageNet.", "published": "2018-10-16 17:26:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07151v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
