{"title": "A Latent Space Analysis of Editor Lifecycles in Wikipedia", "abstract": "Collaborations such as Wikipedia are a key part of the value of the modern\nInternet. At the same time there is concern that these collaborations are\nthreatened by high levels of member turnover. In this paper we borrow ideas\nfrom topic analysis to editor activity on Wikipedia over time into a latent\nspace that offers an insight into the evolving patterns of editor behavior.\nThis latent space representation reveals a number of different categories of\neditor (e.g. content experts, social networkers) and we show that it does\nprovide a signal that predicts an editor's departure from the community. We\nalso show that long term editors gradually diversify their participation by\nshifting edit preference from one or two namespaces to multiple namespaces and\nexperience relatively soft evolution in their editor profiles, while short term\neditors generally distribute their contribution randomly among the namespaces\nand experience considerably fluctuated evolution in their editor profiles.", "published": "2014-07-29 14:25:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7736v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
