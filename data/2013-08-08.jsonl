{"title": "The Royal Birth of 2013: Analysing and Visualising Public Sentiment in\n  the UK Using Twitter", "abstract": "Analysis of information retrieved from microblogging services such as Twitter\ncan provide valuable insight into public sentiment in a geographic region. This\ninsight can be enriched by visualising information in its geographic context.\nTwo underlying approaches for sentiment analysis are dictionary-based and\nmachine learning. The former is popular for public sentiment analysis, and the\nlatter has found limited use for aggregating public sentiment from Twitter\ndata. The research presented in this paper aims to extend the machine learning\napproach for aggregating public sentiment. To this end, a framework for\nanalysing and visualising public sentiment from a Twitter corpus is developed.\nA dictionary-based approach and a machine learning approach are implemented\nwithin the framework and compared using one UK case study, namely the royal\nbirth of 2013. The case study validates the feasibility of the framework for\nanalysis and rapid visualisation. One observation is that there is good\ncorrelation between the results produced by the popular dictionary-based\napproach and the machine learning approach when large volumes of tweets are\nanalysed. However, for rapid analysis to be possible faster methods need to be\ndeveloped using big data techniques and parallel methods.", "published": "2013-08-08 13:31:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1847v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
