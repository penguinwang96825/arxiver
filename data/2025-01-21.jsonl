{"title": "An Optimal Transport approach to arbitrage correction: Application to volatility Stress-Tests", "abstract": "We present a method based on optimal transport to remove arbitrage\nopportunities within a finite set of option prices. The method is notably\nintended for regulatory stress-tests, which impose to apply important local\ndistortions to implied volatility surfaces. The resulting stressed option\nprices are naturally associated to a family of signed marginal measures: we\nformulate the process of removing arbitrage as a projection onto the subset of\nmartingale measures with respect to a Wasserstein metric in the space of signed\nmeasures. We show how this projection problem can be recast as an optimal\ntransport problem; in view of the numerical solution, we apply an entropic\nregularization technique. For the regularized problem, we derive a strong\nduality formula, show convergence results as the regularization parameter\napproaches zero, and formulate a multi-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm, where\neach iteration involves, at worse, finding the root of an explicit scalar\nfunction. The convergence of this algorithm is also established. We compare our\nmethod with the existing approach by [Cohen, Reisinger and Wang, Appl.\\ Math.\\\nFin.\\ 2020] across various scenarios and test cases.", "published": "2025-01-21 15:03:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12195v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "91G80, 49Q22"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
