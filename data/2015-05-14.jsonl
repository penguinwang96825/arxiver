{"title": "Rank diversity of languages: Generic behavior in computational\n  linguistics", "abstract": "Statistical studies of languages have focused on the rank-frequency\ndistribution of words. Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word ranks\nchange in time and call this distribution \\emph{rank diversity}. We calculate\nthis diversity for books published in six European languages since 1800, and\nfind that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the mean and\nstandard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define three\ndifferent word regimes of languages: \"heads\" consist of words which almost do\nnot change their rank in time, \"bodies\" are words of general use, while \"tails\"\nare comprised by context-specific words and vary their rank considerably in\ntime. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by\nlinguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model\nwhich reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity.\nRank diversity of words can be understood as the result of random variations in\nrank, where the size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that\nthe core size is similar for all languages studied.", "published": "2015-05-14 16:21:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03783v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Distant Supervision for Entity Linking", "abstract": "Entity linking is an indispensable operation of populating knowledge\nrepositories for information extraction. It studies on aligning a textual\nentity mention to its corresponding disambiguated entry in a knowledge\nrepository. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm named distantly supervised\nentity linking (DSEL), in the sense that the disambiguated entities that belong\nto a huge knowledge repository (Freebase) are automatically aligned to the\ncorresponding descriptive webpages (Wiki pages). In this way, a large scale of\nweakly labeled data can be generated without manual annotation and fed to a\nclassifier for linking more newly discovered entities. Compared with\ntraditional paradigms based on solo knowledge base, DSEL benefits more via\njointly leveraging the respective advantages of Freebase and Wikipedia.\nSpecifically, the proposed paradigm facilitates bridging the disambiguated\nlabels (Freebase) of entities and their textual descriptions (Wikipedia) for\nWeb-scale entities. Experiments conducted on a dataset of 140,000 items and\n60,000 features achieve a baseline F1-measure of 0.517. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe feature performance and improve the F1-measure to 0.545.", "published": "2015-05-14 18:15:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03823v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
