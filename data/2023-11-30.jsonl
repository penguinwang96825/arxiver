{"title": "The two square root laws of market impact and the role of sophisticated market participants", "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to disentangle the roles of volume and of participation rate in the price response of the market to a sequence of transactions. To do so, we are inspired the methodology introduced in arXiv:1402.1288, arXiv:1805.07134 where price dynamics are derived from order flow dynamics using no arbitrage assumptions. We extend this approach by taking into account a sophisticated market participant having superior abilities to analyse market dynamics. Our results lead to the recovery of two square root laws: (i) For a given participation rate, during the execution of a metaorder, the market impact evolves in a square root manner with respect to the cumulated traded volume. (ii) For a given executed volume $Q$, the market impact is proportional to $\\sqrt\u03b3$, where $\u03b3$ denotes the participation rate, for $\u03b3$ large enough. Smaller participation rates induce a more linear dependence of the market impact in the participation rate.", "published": "2023-11-30 06:43:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18283v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
