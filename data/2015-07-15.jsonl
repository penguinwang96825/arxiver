{"title": "Associative Measures and Multi-word Unit Extraction in Turkish", "abstract": "Associative measures are \"mathematical formulas determining the strength of\nassociation between two or more words based on their occurrences and\ncooccurrences in a text corpus\" (Pecina, 2010, p. 138). The purpose of this\npaper is to test the 12 associative measures that Text-NSP (Banerjee &\nPedersen, 2003) contains on a 10-million-word subcorpus of Turkish National\nCorpus (TNC) (Aksan et.al., 2012). A statistical comparison of those measures\nis out of the scope of the study, and the measures will be evaluated according\nto the linguistic relevance of the rankings they provide. The focus of the\nstudy is basically on optimizing the corpus data, before applying the measures\nand then, evaluating the rankings produced by these measures as a whole, not on\nthe linguistic relevance of individual n-grams. The findings include\nintra-linguistically relevant associative measures for a comma delimited,\nsentence splitted, lower-cased, well-balanced, representative, 10-million-word\ncorpus of Turkish.", "published": "2015-07-15 13:40:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04214v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
