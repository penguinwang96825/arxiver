{"title": "A Novel Approach to Document Classification using WordNet", "abstract": "Content based Document Classification is one of the biggest challenges in the\ncontext of free text mining. Current algorithms on document classifications\nmostly rely on cluster analysis based on bag-of-words approach. However that\nmethod is still being applied to many modern scientific dilemmas. It has\nestablished a strong presence in fields like economics and social science to\nmerit serious attention from the researchers. In this paper we would like to\npropose and explore an alternative grounded more securely on the dictionary\nclassification and correlatedness of words and phrases. It is expected that\napplication of our existing knowledge about the underlying classification\nstructure may lead to improvement of the classifier's performance.", "published": "2015-10-04 09:24:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02755v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
