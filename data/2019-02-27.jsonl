{"title": "The VOiCES from a Distance Challenge 2019 Evaluation Plan", "abstract": "The \"VOiCES from a Distance Challenge 2019\" is designed to foster research in the area of speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition (ASR) with the special focus on single channel distant/far-field audio, under noisy conditions. The main objectives of this challenge are to: (i) benchmark state-of-the-art technology in the area of speaker recognition and automatic speech recognition (ASR), (ii) support the development of new ideas and technologies in speaker recognition and ASR, (iii) support new research groups entering the field of distant/far-field speech processing, and (iv) provide a new, publicly available dataset to the community that exhibits realistic distance characteristics.", "published": "2019-02-27 23:22:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10828v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
