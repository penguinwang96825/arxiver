{"title": "Wavelet analysis and energy-based measures for oil-food price relationship as a footprint of financialisation effect", "abstract": "In this paper we exploit the wavelet analysis approach to investigate oil-food price correlation and its determinants in the domains of time and frequency. Wavelet analysis is able to differentiate high frequency from low frequency movements which correspond, respectively, to short and long run dynamics. We show that the significant local correlation between food and oil is only apparent and this is mainly due both to the activity of commodity index investments and, to a lesser extent, to a growing demand from emerging economies. Moreover, the activity of commodity index investments gives evidence of the overall financialisation process. In addition, we employ wavelet entropy to assess the predictability of the time series under consideration at different frequencies. We find that some variables share a similar predictability structure with food and oil. These variables are the ones that move the most along with oil and food. We also introduce a novel measure, the Cross Wavelet Energy Entropy Measure (CWEEM), based on wavelet transformation and information entropy, with the aim of quantifying the intrinsic predictability of food and oil given demand from emerging economies, commodity index investments, financial stress, and global economic activity. The results show that these dynamics are best predicted by global economic activity at all frequencies and by demand from emerging economies and commodity index investments at high frequencies only.", "published": "2021-04-24 06:33:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11891v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Hermite Polynomial-based Valuation of American Options with General Jump-Diffusion Processes", "abstract": "We present a new approximation scheme for the price and exercise policy of American options. The scheme is based on Hermite polynomial expansions of the transition density of the underlying asset dynamics and the early exercise premium representation of the American option price. The advantages of the proposed approach are threefold. First, our approach does not require the transition density and characteristic functions of the underlying asset dynamics to be attainable in closed form. Second, our approach is fast and accurate, while the prices and exercise policy can be jointly produced. Third, our approach has a wide range of applications. We show that the proposed approximations of the price and optimal exercise boundary converge to the true ones. We also provide a numerical method based on a step function to implement our proposed approach. Applications to nonlinear mean-reverting models, double mean-reverting models, Merton's and Kou's jump-diffusion models are presented and discussed.", "published": "2021-04-24 03:16:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11870v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "econ.EM", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR", "stat.CO"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
