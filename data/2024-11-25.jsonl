{"title": "Deep Learning-Based Electricity Price Forecast for Virtual Bidding in Wholesale Electricity Market", "abstract": "Virtual bidding plays an important role in two-settlement electric power\nmarkets, as it can reduce discrepancies between day-ahead and real-time\nmarkets. Renewable energy penetration increases volatility in electricity\nprices, making accurate forecasting critical for virtual bidders, reducing\nuncertainty and maximizing profits. This study presents a Transformer-based\ndeep learning model to forecast the price spread between real-time and\nday-ahead electricity prices in the ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of\nTexas) market. The proposed model leverages various time-series features,\nincluding load forecasts, solar and wind generation forecasts, and temporal\nattributes. The model is trained under realistic constraints and validated\nusing a walk-forward approach by updating the model every week. Based on the\nprice spread prediction results, several trading strategies are proposed and\nthe most effective strategy for maximizing cumulative profit under realistic\nmarket conditions is identified through backtesting. The results show that the\nstrategy of trading only at the peak hour with a precision score of over 50%\nproduces nearly consistent profit over the test period. The proposed method\nunderscores the importance of an accurate electricity price forecasting model\nand introduces a new method of evaluating the price forecast model from a\nvirtual bidder's perspective, providing valuable insights for future research.", "published": "2024-11-25 20:04:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00062v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Pricing Multi-strike Quanto Call Options on Multiple Assets with Stochastic Volatility, Correlation, and Exchange Rates", "abstract": "Quanto options allow the buyer to exchange the foreign currency payoff into\nthe domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate. We investigate quanto options\nwith multiple underlying assets valued in different foreign currencies each\nwith a different strike price in the payoff function. We carry out a\ncomparative performance analysis of different stochastic volatility (SV),\nstochastic correlation (SC), and stochastic exchange rate (SER) models to\ndetermine the best combination of these models for Monte Carlo (MC) simulation\npricing. In addition, we test the performance of all model variants with\nconstant correlation as a benchmark. We find that a combination of GARCH-Jump\nSV, Weibull SC, and Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) SER performs best. In addition, we\nanalyze different discretization schemes and their results. In our simulations,\nthe Milstein scheme yields the best balance between execution times and lower\nstandard deviations of price estimates. Furthermore, we find that incorporating\nmean reversion into stochastic correlation and stochastic FX rate modeling is\nbeneficial for MC simulation pricing. We improve the accuracy of our\nsimulations by implementing antithetic variates variance reduction. Finally, we\nderive the correlation risk parameters Cora and Gora in our framework so that\ncorrelation hedging of quanto options can be performed.", "published": "2024-11-25 17:56:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16617v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
{"title": "Predictive Power of LLMs in Financial Markets", "abstract": "Predicting the movement of the stock market and other assets has been\nvaluable over the past few decades. Knowing how the value of a certain sector\nmarket may move in the future provides much information for investors, as they\nuse that information to develop strategies to maximize profit or minimize risk.\nHowever, market data are quite noisy, and it is challenging to choose the right\ndata or the right model to create such predictions. With the rise of large\nlanguage models, there are ways to analyze certain data much more efficiently\nthan before.\n  Our goal is to determine whether the GPT model provides more useful\ninformation compared to other traditional transformer models, such as the BERT\nmodel. We shall use data from the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which provides\nsummaries of economic conditions in different districts in the US. Using such\ndata, we then employ the LLM's to make predictions on the correlations. Using\nthese correlations, we then compare the results with well-known strategies and\ndetermine whether knowing the economic conditions improves investment\ndecisions. We conclude that the Beige Book does contain information regarding\ncorrelations amongst different assets, yet the GPT model has too much\nlook-ahead bias and that traditional models still triumph.", "published": "2024-11-25 16:53:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16569v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}

{"title": "CatNet: Effective FDR Control in LSTM with Gaussian Mirrors and SHAP Feature Importance", "abstract": "We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery\nRate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror\n(GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we\nintroduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations\n(SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based\ndependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a\nrobust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate\nCatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link\nfunctions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high\nstatistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in\ndifferent low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its\nrobustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in\nreal world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to\nforecast the prices of S\\&P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that\nour model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM\nmodels without feature selection and FDR control.

{"title": "What events matter for exchange rate volatility ?", "abstract": "This paper expands on stochastic volatility models by proposing a data-driven\nmethod to select the macroeconomic events most likely to impact volatility. The\npaper identifies and quantifies the effects of macroeconomic events across\nmultiple countries on exchange rate volatility using high-frequency currency\nreturns, while accounting for persistent stochastic volatility effects and\nseasonal components capturing time-of-day patterns. Given the hundreds of\nmacroeconomic announcements and their lags, we rely on sparsity-based methods\nto select relevant events for the model. We contribute to the exchange rate\nliterature in four ways: First, we identify the macroeconomic events that drive\ncurrency volatility, estimate their effects and connect them to macroeconomic\nfundamentals. Second, we find a link between intraday seasonality, trading\nvolume, and the opening hours of major markets across the globe. We provide a\nsimple labor-based explanation for this observed pattern. Third, we show that\nincluding macroeconomic events and seasonal components is crucial for\nforecasting exchange rate volatility.
