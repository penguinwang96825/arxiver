{"title": "Bucking the Trend: Large-Scale Cost-Focused Active Learning for\n  Statistical Machine Translation", "abstract": "We explore how to improve machine translation systems by adding more\ntranslation data in situations where we already have substantial resources. The\nmain challenge is how to buck the trend of diminishing returns that is commonly\nencountered. We present an active learning-style data solicitation algorithm to\nmeet this challenge. We test it, gathering annotations via Amazon Mechanical\nTurk, and find that we get an order of magnitude increase in performance rates\nof improvement.", "published": "2014-10-21 22:55:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5877v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
