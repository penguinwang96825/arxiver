{"title": "Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning Classifiers in Sentiment\n  Mining", "abstract": "In recent years, the use of machine learning classifiers is of great value in\nsolving a variety of problems in text classification. Sentiment mining is a\nkind of text classification in which, messages are classified according to\nsentiment orientation such as positive or negative. This paper extends the idea\nof evaluating the performance of various classifiers to show their\neffectiveness in sentiment mining of online product reviews. The product\nreviews are collected from Amazon reviews. To evaluate the performance of\nclassifiers various evaluation methods like random sampling, linear sampling\nand bootstrap sampling are used. Our results shows that support vector machine\nwith bootstrap sampling method outperforms others classifiers and sampling\nmethods in terms of misclassification rate.", "published": "2014-02-17 05:24:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3891v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
