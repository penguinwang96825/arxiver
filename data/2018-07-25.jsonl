{"title": "Robustness to fundamental uncertainty in AGI alignment", "abstract": "The AGI alignment problem has a bimodal distribution of outcomes with most outcomes clustering around the poles of total success and existential, catastrophic failure. Consequently, attempts to solve AGI alignment should, all else equal, prefer false negatives (ignoring research programs that would have been successful) to false positives (pursuing research programs that will unexpectedly fail). Thus, we propose adopting a policy of responding to points of philosophical and practical uncertainty associated with the alignment problem by limiting and choosing necessary assumptions to reduce the risk of false positives. Herein we explore in detail two relevant points of uncertainty that AGI alignment research hinges on---meta-ethical uncertainty and uncertainty about mental phenomena---and show how to reduce false positives in response to them.", "published": "2018-07-25 20:11:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09836v2", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Video Storytelling: Textual Summaries for Events", "abstract": "Bridging vision and natural language is a longstanding goal in computer vision and multimedia research. While earlier works focus on generating a single-sentence description for visual content, recent works have studied paragraph generation. In this work, we introduce the problem of video storytelling, which aims at generating coherent and succinct stories for long videos. Video storytelling introduces new challenges, mainly due to the diversity of the story and the length and complexity of the video. We propose novel methods to address the challenges. First, we propose a context-aware framework for multimodal embedding learning, where we design a Residual Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network to leverage contextual information from past and future. Second, we propose a Narrator model to discover the underlying storyline. The Narrator is formulated as a reinforcement learning agent which is trained by directly optimizing the textual metric of the generated story. We evaluate our method on the Video Story dataset, a new dataset that we have collected to enable the study. We compare our method with multiple state-of-the-art baselines, and show that our method achieves better performance, in terms of quantitative measures and user study.", "published": "2018-07-25 02:43:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09418v3", "categories": ["cs.MM", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.MM"}
{"title": "PADME: A Deep Learning-based Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction", "abstract": "In silico drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is an important and challenging problem in biomedical research with a huge potential benefit to the pharmaceutical industry and patients. Most existing methods for DTI prediction including deep learning models generally have binary endpoints, which could be an oversimplification of the problem, and those methods are typically unable to handle cold-target problems, i.e., problems involving target protein that never appeared in the training set. Towards this, we contrived PADME (Protein And Drug Molecule interaction prEdiction), a framework based on Deep Neural Networks, to predict real-valued interaction strength between compounds and proteins without requiring feature engineering. PADME takes both compound and protein information as inputs, so it is capable of solving cold-target (and cold-drug) problems. To our knowledge, we are the first to combine Molecular Graph Convolution (MGC) for compound featurization with protein descriptors for DTI prediction. We used multiple cross-validation split schemes and evaluation metrics to measure the performance of PADME on multiple datasets, including the ToxCast dataset, and PADME consistently dominates baseline methods. The results of a case study, which predicts the binding affinity between various compounds and androgen receptor (AR), suggest PADME's potential in drug development. The scalability of PADME is another advantage in the age of Big Data.", "published": "2018-07-25 17:46:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09741v4", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Deep Contextual Multi-armed Bandits", "abstract": "Contextual multi-armed bandit problems arise frequently in important industrial applications. Existing solutions model the context either linearly, which enables uncertainty driven (principled) exploration, or non-linearly, by using epsilon-greedy exploration policies. Here we present a deep learning framework for contextual multi-armed bandits that is both non-linear and enables principled exploration at the same time. We tackle the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off through Thompson sampling by exploiting the connection between inference time dropout and sampling from the posterior over the weights of a Bayesian neural network. In order to adjust the level of exploration automatically as more data is made available to the model, the dropout rate is learned rather than considered a hyperparameter. We demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces regret on two tasks (the UCI Mushroom task and the Casino Parity task) when compared to 1) non-contextual bandits, 2) epsilon-greedy deep contextual bandits, and 3) fixed dropout rate deep contextual bandits. Our approach is currently being applied to marketing optimization problems at HubSpot.", "published": "2018-07-25 18:25:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09809v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Topics in Random Matrices and Statistical Machine Learning", "abstract": "This thesis consists of two independent parts: random matrices, which form the first one-third of this thesis, and machine learning, which constitutes the remaining part. The main results of this thesis are as follows: a necessary and sufficient condition for the inverse moments of $(m,n,\u03b2)$-Laguerre matrices and compound Wishart matrices to be finite; the universal weak consistency and the strong consistency of the $k$-nearest neighbor rule in metrically sigma-finite dimensional spaces and metrically finite dimensional spaces respectively. In Part I, the Chapter 1 introduces the $(m,n,\u03b2)$-Laguerre matrix, Wishart and compound Wishart matrix and their joint eigenvalue distribution. While in Chapter 2, a necessary and sufficient condition to have finite inverse moments has been derived. In Part II, the Chapter 1 introduces the various notions of metric dimension and differentiation property followed by our proof for the necessary part of Preiss' result. Further, Chapter 2 gives an introduction to the mathematical concepts in statistical machine learning and then the $k$-nearest neighbor rule is presented in Chapter 3 with a proof of Stone's theorem. In chapters 4 and 5, we present our main results and some possible future directions based on it.", "published": "2018-07-25 02:44:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09419v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "An Adaptive CM Array Preconditioner for Blind Multi-User Separation", "abstract": "The family of constant-modulus algorithms is widely used in wireless communication systems and in radar. The classical constant-modulus adaptive (CMA) algorithm, however, fails to lock onto a single mode when used in conjunction with an antenna array. Instead, it equalizes the entire spatial spectrum. In this paper, we describe in full detail our recently proposed approach for the separation of multiple users in a radio system with frequency reuse, such as a cellular network, making use of the CMA algorithm. Based on the observation that the differential filter weights resemble a superposition of the array steering vectors, we cast the original task to a direction-of-arrival estimation problem. With rigorous theoretical analysis of the array response based on the discrete-space Fourier transform we elaborate a solution that solves the problem by finding the roots of a polynomial equation. We provide a numerical example to demonstrate the validity of the approach under high-SNR conditions. In addition, we propose a more general preprocessor for the CMA array which allows the modulated signals to differ in amplitude. As a byproduct, the preprocessor yields a low-cost estimate of the number of concurrent users, i.e. the model order, by simply counting the roots with the strongest response.", "published": "2018-07-25 16:11:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09692v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Efficient sampling and robust 3D diffusion magnetic resonance imaging signal reconstruction", "abstract": "This paper presents novel single and multi-shell sampling schemes for diffusion MRI. In diffusion MRI, it is paramount that the number of samples is as small as possible in order that scan times are practical in a clinical setting. The proposed schemes use an efficient number of measurements in that the number of samples is equal to the degrees of freedom in the orthonormal bases used for reconstruction. Novel reconstruction algorithms based on smaller subsystems of linear equations, as compared to the standard regularized least-squares method, are developed for both single and multi-shells sampling schemes. The smaller matrices used in these novel reconstruction algorithms are designed to be well-conditioned, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Accurate and robust reconstruction is also achieved through incorporation of regularization into the novel reconstruction algorithms and using a Rician or non-central Chi noise model. We quantitatively validate our single and multi-shell schemes against standard least-squares reconstruction methods to show that they enable more accurate reconstruction when the number of samples is equal to the degrees of freedom in the basis. Human brain data is also used to qualitatively evaluate reconstruction", "published": "2018-07-25 14:41:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09637v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
