{"title": "KANOP: A Data-Efficient Option Pricing Model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks", "abstract": "Inspired by the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we\nintroduce the KAN-based Option Pricing (KANOP) model to value American-style\noptions, building on the conventional Least Square Monte Carlo (LSMC)\nalgorithm. KANs, which are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem,\noffer a data-efficient alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons,\nrequiring fewer hidden layers to achieve a higher level of performance. By\nleveraging the flexibility of KANs, KANOP provides a learnable alternative to\nthe conventional set of basis functions used in the LSMC model, allowing the\nmodel to adapt to the pricing task and effectively estimate the expected\ncontinuation value. Using examples of standard American and Asian-American\noptions, we demonstrate that KANOP produces more reliable option value\nestimates, both for single-dimensional cases and in more complex scenarios\ninvolving multiple input variables. The delta estimated by the KANOP model is\nalso more accurate than that obtained using conventional basis functions, which\nis crucial for effective option hedging. Graphical illustrations further\nvalidate KANOP's ability to accurately model the expected continuation value\nfor American-style options.", "published": "2024-10-01 05:56:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00419v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CE", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Tax systems for sustainable economic development", "abstract": "A complete description of taxation systems that ensure sustainable economic\ndevelopment is given. These tax systems depend on production technologies and\ngross output volumes. Explicit formulas for such dependencies are found. In a\nsustainable economy, the value added either exceeds or is strictly less than\nthe value of the product produced. The latter is determined by the tax system.\nThe concept of perfect taxation systems is introduced and their explicit form\nis found. For perfect taxation systems, it is proved that the vector of gross\noutput should belong to the interior of the cone formed by the vectors of the\ncolumns of the total cost matrix. It is shown that under perfect taxation\nsystems the vector of gross output must satisfy a certain system of linear\nhomogeneous equations. It is shown, that under certain conditions there are tax\nsystems under which certain industries require subsidies for their existence.\nUnder such taxation systems, the industries that require subsidies are\nidentified. The family of all non negative solutions of the system of linear\nequations and inequalities is constructed, which allowed us to formulate a\ncriterion for describing all equilibrium states in which partial clearing of\nmarkets occurs.", "published": "2024-10-01 08:39:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00505v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Impermanent loss and loss-vs-rebalancing I: some statistical properties", "abstract": "There are two predominant metrics to assess the performance of automated\nmarket makers and their profitability for liquidity providers: 'impermanent\nloss' (IL) and 'loss-versus-rebalance' (LVR). In this short paper we shed light\non the statistical aspects of both concepts and show that they are more similar\nthan conventionally appreciated. Our analysis uses the properties of a random\nwalk and some analytical properties of the statistical integral combined with\nthe mechanics of a constant function market maker (CFMM). We consider non-toxic\nor rather unspecific trading in this paper. Our main finding can be summarized\nin one sentence: For Brownian motion with a given volatility, IL and LVR have\nidentical expectation values but vastly differing distribution functions.", "published": "2024-10-01 16:43:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00854v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
