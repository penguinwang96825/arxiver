Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it.

While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,\nand Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks\ninvolving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,\nauthorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional\nvoice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without\nenforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond\nreputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive\npolitical messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about\naccountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that\nare deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation\ncampaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal\nfallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or\nunion protection. To make sense of these shifting dynamics, we introduce the\nPRAC3 framework, an expansion of C3 that foregrounds Privacy, Reputation,\nAccountability, Consent, Credit, and Compensation as interdependent pillars of\ndata used in the synthetic voice economy. This framework captures how privacy\nrisks are amplified through non-consensual training, how reputational harm\narises from decontextualized deployment, and how accountability can be\nreimagined AI Data ecosystems.

Achieving accurate CP-based positioning\nrequires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution,\nLOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions.\nTo this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates\nthe need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep\nlearning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the\ntrilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes\nunreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to\nfuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving\nusers across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed\nterrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset,\nfeaturing a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show\nthat the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the\nKITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS\nservices--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for\nGNSS-denied environments.", "published": "2025-07-22 13:57:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16600v1", "categories": ["cs.IT", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions.

The original geometry is embedded into the problem by\nrepresenting it with a phase-field function. This paper introduces ddfem, an\nextensible Python package to provide a framework for transforming PDEs into a\nDiffuse Domain formulation. We aim to make the application of a variety of\ndifferent Diffuse Domain approaches more accessible and straightforward to use.\nThe ddfem package includes features to intuitively define complex domains by\ncombining signed distance functions and provides a number of DDM transformers\nfor general second evolution equations. In addition, we present a new approach\nfor combining multiple boundary conditions of different types on distinct\nboundary segments. This is achieved by applying a normalised weighting, derived\nfrom multiple phase fields, to combine the additional boundary terms in the\nDiffuse Domain formulations. The domain definition and Diffuse Domain\ntransformation provided by our package are designed to be compatible with a\nwide range of existing finite element solvers without requiring code\nalterations. Both the original (non-linear) PDEs provided by the user and the\nresulting transformed PDEs on the extended domain are defined using the Unified\nForm Language UFL which is a domain specific language used by a number of\nsoftware packages.

Grounded in a field investigation\nof the Indian pharmaceutical retail sector, this study integrates primary data\ncollection, consumer conjoint analysis and design of experiments to develop an\nempirically grounded agent-based simulation of multi-channel competition among\nunorganized, organized and e-pharmaceutical retailers. The results of the\nconjoint analysis reveal that store attributes of price discount, quality of\nproducts offered, variety of assortment, and degree of personalized service,\nand customer attributes of distance, degree of mobility, and degree of\nemergency are key determinants of optimal store choice strategies. The primary\ninsight obtained from the agent-based modeling is that the attribute levels of\neach individual retailer have some effect on other retailers performance. The\nfield-calibrated simulation also evidenced counterintuitive behavior that an\nincrease in unorganized price discounts initially leads to an increase in\naverage footprint at unorganized retailers, but eventually leads to these\nretailers moving out of the market. Hence, the unorganized retailers should not\nincrease the price discount offered beyond a tipping point or it will be\ndetrimental to them. Another counterintuitive behavior found was that high\nemergency customers give less importance to variety of assortment than low\nemergency customers.
