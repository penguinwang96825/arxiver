{"title": "Generating abbreviations using Google Books library", "abstract": "The article describes the original method of creating a dictionary of\nabbreviations based on the Google Books Ngram Corpus. The dictionary of\nabbreviations is designed for Russian, yet as its methodology is universal it\ncan be applied to any language. The dictionary can be used to define the\nfunction of the period during text segmentation in various applied systems of\ntext processing. The article describes difficulties encountered in the process\nof its construction as well as the ways to overcome them. A model of evaluating\na probability of first and second type errors (extraction accuracy and\nfullness) is constructed. Certain statistical data for the use of abbreviations\nare provided.", "published": "2014-10-04 19:00:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1080v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.AP", "91F20, 62P25", "I.2.7; J.5"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Explain Images with Multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (m-RNN) model\nfor generating novel sentence descriptions to explain the content of images. It\ndirectly models the probability distribution of generating a word given\nprevious words and the image. Image descriptions are generated by sampling from\nthis distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent\nneural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These\ntwo sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the\nwhole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on three\nbenchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, and Flickr 30K). Our model\noutperforms the state-of-the-art generative method. In addition, the m-RNN\nmodel can be applied to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and\nachieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods\nwhich directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval.", "published": "2014-10-04 20:24:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1090v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "I.2.6; I.2.7; I.2.10"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
