{"title": "Learning language through pictures", "abstract": "We propose Imaginet, a model of learning visually grounded representations of\nlanguage from coupled textual and visual input. The model consists of two Gated\nRecurrent Unit networks with shared word embeddings, and uses a multi-task\nobjective by receiving a textual description of a scene and trying to\nconcurrently predict its visual representation and the next word in the\nsentence. Mimicking an important aspect of human language learning, it acquires\nmeaning representations for individual words from descriptions of visual\nscenes. Moreover, it learns to effectively use sequential structure in semantic\ninterpretation of multi-word phrases.", "published": "2015-06-11 14:45:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03694v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Entity-Specific Sentiment Classification of Yahoo News Comments", "abstract": "Sentiment classification is widely used for product reviews and in online\nsocial media such as forums, Twitter, and blogs. However, the problem of\nclassifying the sentiment of user comments on news sites has not been addressed\nyet. News sites cover a wide range of domains including politics, sports,\ntechnology, and entertainment, in contrast to other online social sites such as\nforums and review sites, which are specific to a particular domain. A user\nassociated with a news site is likely to post comments on diverse topics (e.g.,\npolitics, smartphones, and sports) or diverse entities (e.g., Obama, iPhone, or\nGoogle). Classifying the sentiment of users tied to various entities may help\nobtain a holistic view of their personality, which could be useful in\napplications such as online advertising, content personalization, and political\ncampaign planning. In this paper, we formulate the problem of entity-specific\nsentiment classification of comments posted on news articles in Yahoo News and\npropose novel features that are specific to news comments. Experimental results\nshow that our models outperform state-of-the-art baselines.", "published": "2015-06-11 18:53:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03775v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
