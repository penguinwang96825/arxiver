{"title": "The Transactional Nature of Quantum Information", "abstract": "Information, in its communications sense, is a transactional property. If the received signals communicate choices made by the sender of the signals, then information has been transmitter by the sender to the receiver. Given this reality, the potential information in an unknown pure quantum state should be non-zero. We examine transactional quantum information, which unlike von Neumann entropy, depends on the mutuality of the relationship between the sender and the receiver, associating information with an unknown pure state. The information that can be obtained from a pure state in repeated experiments is potentially infinite.", "published": "2009-07-14 22:27:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2465v1", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "quant-ph"}
