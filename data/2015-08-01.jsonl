{"title": "Separated by an Un-common Language: Towards Judgment Language Informed\n  Vector Space Modeling", "abstract": "A common evaluation practice in the vector space models (VSMs) literature is\nto measure the models' ability to predict human judgments about lexical\nsemantic relations between word pairs. Most existing evaluation sets, however,\nconsist of scores collected for English word pairs only, ignoring the potential\nimpact of the judgment language in which word pairs are presented on the human\nscores. In this paper we translate two prominent evaluation sets, wordsim353\n(association) and SimLex999 (similarity), from English to Italian, German and\nRussian and collect scores for each dataset from crowdworkers fluent in its\nlanguage. Our analysis reveals that human judgments are strongly impacted by\nthe judgment language. Moreover, we show that the predictions of monolingual\nVSMs do not necessarily best correlate with human judgments made with the\nlanguage used for model training, suggesting that models and humans are\naffected differently by the language they use when making semantic judgments.\nFinally, we show that in a large number of setups, multilingual VSM combination\nresults in improved correlations with human judgments, suggesting that\nmultilingualism may partially compensate for the judgment language effect on\nhuman judgments.", "published": "2015-08-01 10:24:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00106v5", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
