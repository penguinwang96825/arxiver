{"title": "Analytic solution of a model of language competition with bilingualism\n  and interlinguistic similarity", "abstract": "An in-depth analytic study of a model of language dynamics is presented: a\nmodel which tackles the problem of the coexistence of two languages within a\nclosed community of speakers taking into account bilingualism and incorporating\na parameter to measure the distance between languages. After previous numerical\nsimulations, the model yielded that coexistence might lead to survival of both\nlanguages within monolingual speakers along with a bilingual community or to\nextinction of the weakest tongue depending on different parameters. In this\npaper, such study is closed with thorough analytical calculations to settle the\nresults in a robust way and previous results are refined with some\nmodifications. From the present analysis it is possible to almost completely\nassay the number and nature of the equilibrium points of the model, which\ndepend on its parameters, as well as to build a phase space based on them.\nAlso, we obtain conclusions on the way the languages evolve with time. Our\nrigorous considerations also suggest ways to further improve the model and\nfacilitate the comparison of its consequences with those from other approaches\nor with real data.", "published": "2013-03-20 15:12:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4959v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
