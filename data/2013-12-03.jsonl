{"title": "Multilinguals and Wikipedia Editing", "abstract": "This article analyzes one month of edits to Wikipedia in order to examine the\nrole of users editing multiple language editions (referred to as multilingual\nusers). Such multilingual users may serve an important function in diffusing\ninformation across different language editions of the encyclopedia, and prior\nwork has suggested this could reduce the level of self-focus bias in each\nedition. This study finds multilingual users are much more active than their\nsingle-edition (monolingual) counterparts. They are found in all language\neditions, but smaller-sized editions with fewer users have a higher percentage\nof multilingual users than larger-sized editions. About a quarter of\nmultilingual users always edit the same articles in multiple languages, while\njust over 40% of multilingual users edit different articles in different\nlanguages. When non-English users do edit a second language edition, that\nedition is most frequently English. Nonetheless, several regional and\nlinguistic cross-editing patterns are also present.", "published": "2013-12-03 23:04:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0976v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL", "cs.DL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "H.5.4; H.5.3"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
