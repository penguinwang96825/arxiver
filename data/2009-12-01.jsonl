{"title": "Approximate Sparse Recovery: Optimizing Time and Measurements", "abstract": "An approximate sparse recovery system consists of parameters $k,N$, an $m$-by-$N$ measurement matrix, $\u03a6$, and a decoding algorithm, $\\mathcal{D}$. Given a vector, $x$, the system approximates $x$ by $\\widehat x =\\mathcal{D}(\u03a6x)$, which must satisfy $\\| \\widehat x - x\\|_2\\le C \\|x - x_k\\|_2$, where $x_k$ denotes the optimal $k$-term approximation to $x$. For each vector $x$, the system must succeed with probability at least 3/4. Among the goals in designing such systems are minimizing the number $m$ of measurements and the runtime of the decoding algorithm, $\\mathcal{D}$.\n  In this paper, we give a system with $m=O(k \\log(N/k))$ measurements--matching a lower bound, up to a constant factor--and decoding time $O(k\\log^c N)$, matching a lower bound up to $\\log(N)$ factors.\n  We also consider the encode time (i.e., the time to multiply $\u03a6$ by $x$), the time to update measurements (i.e., the time to multiply $\u03a6$ by a 1-sparse $x$), and the robustness and stability of the algorithm (adding noise before and after the measurements). Our encode and update times are optimal up to $\\log(N)$ factors.", "published": "2009-12-01 18:47:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0229v1", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
