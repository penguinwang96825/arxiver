{"title": "Optimistic mirror descent in saddle-point problems: Going the extra (gradient) mile", "abstract": "Owing to their connection with generative adversarial networks (GANs), saddle-point problems have recently attracted considerable interest in machine learning and beyond. By necessity, most theoretical guarantees revolve around convex-concave (or even linear) problems; however, making theoretical inroads towards efficient GAN training depends crucially on moving beyond this classic framework. To make piecemeal progress along these lines, we analyze the behavior of mirror descent (MD) in a class of non-monotone problems whose solutions coincide with those of a naturally associated variational inequality - a property which we call coherence. We first show that ordinary, \"vanilla\" MD converges under a strict version of this condition, but not otherwise; in particular, it may fail to converge even in bilinear models with a unique solution. We then show that this deficiency is mitigated by optimism: by taking an \"extra-gradient\" step, optimistic mirror descent (OMD) converges in all coherent problems. Our analysis generalizes and extends the results of Daskalakis et al. (2018) for optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in bilinear problems, and makes concrete headway for establishing convergence beyond convex-concave games. We also provide stochastic analogues of these results, and we validate our analysis by numerical experiments in a wide array of GAN models (including Gaussian mixture models, as well as the CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets).", "published": "2018-07-07 08:08:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02629v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.GT", "math.OC", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "When Work Matters: Transforming Classical Network Structures to Graph CNN", "abstract": "Numerous pattern recognition applications can be formed as learning from graph-structured data, including social network, protein-interaction network, the world wide web data, knowledge graph, etc. While convolutional neural network (CNN) facilitates great advances in gridded image/video understanding tasks, very limited attention has been devoted to transform these successful network structures (including Inception net, Residual net, Dense net, etc.) to establish convolutional networks on graph, due to its irregularity and complexity geometric topologies (unordered vertices, unfixed number of adjacent edges/vertices). In this paper, we aim to give a comprehensive analysis of when work matters by transforming different classical network structures to graph CNN, particularly in the basic graph recognition problem. Specifically, we firstly review the general graph CNN methods, especially in its spectral filtering operation on the irregular graph data. We then introduce the basic structures of ResNet, Inception and DenseNet into graph CNN and construct these network structures on graph, named as G_ResNet, G_Inception, G_DenseNet. In particular, it seeks to help graph CNNs by shedding light on how these classical network structures work and providing guidelines for choosing appropriate graph network frameworks. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of these different network structures on several public graph datasets (including social networks and bioinformatic datasets), and demonstrate how different network structures work on graph CNN in the graph recognition task.", "published": "2018-07-07 12:12:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02653v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "VFPred: A Fusion of Signal Processing and Machine Learning techniques in Detecting Ventricular Fibrillation from ECG Signals", "abstract": "Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), one of the most dangerous arrhythmias, is responsible for sudden cardiac arrests. Thus, various algorithms have been developed to predict VF from Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a binary classification problem. In the literature, we find a number of algorithms based on signal processing, where, after some robust mathematical operations the decision is given based on a predefined threshold over a single value. On the other hand, some machine learning based algorithms are also reported in the literature; however, these algorithms merely combine some parameters and make a prediction using those as features. Both the approaches have their perks and pitfalls; thus our motivation was to coalesce them to get the best out of the both worlds. Hence we have developed, VFPred that, in addition to employing a signal processing pipeline, namely, Empirical Mode Decomposition and Discrete Time Fourier Transform for useful feature extraction, uses a Support Vector Machine for efficient classification. VFPred turns out to be a robust algorithm as it is able to successfully segregate the two classes with equal confidence (Sensitivity = 99.99%, Specificity = 98.40%) even from a short signal of 5 seconds long, whereas existing works though requires longer signals, flourishes in one but fails in the other.", "published": "2018-07-07 16:09:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02684v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.SP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
