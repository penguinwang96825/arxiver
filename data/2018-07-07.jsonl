{"title": "Robust and Scalable Differentiable Neural Computer for Question\n  Answering", "abstract": "Deep learning models are often not easily adaptable to new tasks and require\ntask-specific adjustments. The differentiable neural computer (DNC), a\nmemory-augmented neural network, is designed as a general problem solver which\ncan be used in a wide range of tasks. But in reality, it is hard to apply this\nmodel to new tasks. We analyze the DNC and identify possible improvements\nwithin the application of question answering. This motivates a more robust and\nscalable DNC (rsDNC). The objective precondition is to keep the general\ncharacter of this model intact while making its application more reliable and\nspeeding up its required training time. The rsDNC is distinguished by a more\nrobust training, a slim memory unit and a bidirectional architecture. We not\nonly achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI task, but also\nminimize the performance variance between different initializations.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the simplified applicability of the rsDNC to new\ntasks with passable results on the CNN RC task without adaptions.", "published": "2018-07-07 12:44:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02658v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "From Text to Topics in Healthcare Records: An Unsupervised Graph\n  Partitioning Methodology", "abstract": "Electronic Healthcare Records contain large volumes of unstructured data,\nincluding extensive free text. Yet this source of detailed information often\nremains under-used because of a lack of methodologies to extract interpretable\ncontent in a timely manner. Here we apply network-theoretical tools to analyse\nfree text in Hospital Patient Incident reports from the National Health\nService, to find clusters of documents with similar content in an unsupervised\nmanner at different levels of resolution. We combine deep neural network\nparagraph vector text-embedding with multiscale Markov Stability community\ndetection applied to a sparsified similarity graph of document vectors, and\nshowcase the approach on incident reports from Imperial College Healthcare NHS\nTrust, London. The multiscale community structure reveals different levels of\nmeaning in the topics of the dataset, as shown by descriptive terms extracted\nfrom the clusters of records. We also compare a posteriori against hand-coded\ncategories assigned by healthcare personnel, and show that our approach\noutperforms LDA-based models. Our content clusters exhibit good correspondence\nwith two levels of hand-coded categories, yet they also provide further medical\ndetail in certain areas and reveal complementary descriptors of incidents\nbeyond the external classification taxonomy.", "published": "2018-07-07 01:14:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02599v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "cs.SI", "math.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Improving DNN-based Music Source Separation using Phase Features", "abstract": "Music source separation with deep neural networks typically relies only on\namplitude features. In this paper we show that additional phase features can\nimprove the separation performance. Using the theoretical relationship between\nSTFT phase and amplitude, we conjecture that derivatives of the phase are a\ngood feature representation opposed to the raw phase. We verify this conjecture\nexperimentally and propose a new DNN architecture which combines amplitude and\nphase. This joint approach achieves a better signal-to distortion ratio on the\nDSD100 dataset for all instruments compared to a network that uses only\namplitude features. Especially, the bass instrument benefits from the phase\ninformation.", "published": "2018-07-07 19:02:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02710v3", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.LG", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
