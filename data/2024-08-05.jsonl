{"title": "CLVR Ordering of Transactions on AMMs", "abstract": "Trading on decentralized exchanges via an Automated Market Maker (AMM)\nmechanism has been massively adopted, with a daily trading volume reaching $1B.\nThis trading method has also received close attention from researchers, central\nbanks, and financial firms, who have the potential to adopt it to traditional\nfinancial markets such as foreign exchanges and stock markets. A critical\nchallenge of AMM-powered trading is that transaction order has high financial\nvalue, so a policy or method to order transactions in a \"good\" (optimal) manner\nis vital. We offer economic measures of both price stability (low volatility)\nand inequality that inform how a \"social planner\" should pick an optimal\nordering. We show that there is a trade-off between achieving price stability\nand reducing inequality, and that policymakers must choose which to prioritize.\nIn addition, picking the optimal order can often be costly, especially when\nperforming an exhaustive search over trade orderings (permutations). As an\nalternative we provide a simple algorithm, Clever Look-ahead Volatility\nReduction (CLVR). This algorithm constructs an ordering which approximately\nminimizes price volatility with a small computation cost. We also provide\ninsight into the strategy changes that may occur if traders are subject to this\nsequencing algorithm.", "published": "2024-08-05 16:58:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02634v1", "categories": ["cs.GT", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.GT"}
{"title": "Quantile Regression using Random Forest Proximities", "abstract": "Due to the dynamic nature of financial markets, maintaining models that\nproduce precise predictions over time is difficult. Often the goal isn't just\npoint prediction but determining uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty,\nespecially the aleatoric uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of market\ndrivers, helps investors understand varying risk levels. Recently, quantile\nregression forests (QRF) have emerged as a promising solution: Unlike most\nbasic quantile regression methods that need separate models for each quantile,\nquantile regression forests estimate the entire conditional distribution of the\ntarget variable with a single model, while retaining all the salient features\nof a typical random forest. We introduce a novel approach to compute quantile\nregressions from random forests that leverages the proximity (i.e., distance\nmetric) learned by the model and infers the conditional distribution of the\ntarget variable. We evaluate the proposed methodology using publicly available\ndatasets and then apply it towards the problem of forecasting the average daily\nvolume of corporate bonds. We show that using quantile regression using Random\nForest proximities demonstrates superior performance in approximating\nconditional target distributions and prediction intervals to the original\nversion of QRF. We also demonstrate that the proposed framework is\nsignificantly more computationally efficient than traditional approaches to\nquantile regressions.", "published": "2024-08-05 10:02:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02355v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Consistent time travel for realistic interactions with historical data: reinforcement learning for market making", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning works best when the impact of the agent's actions on\nits environment can be perfectly simulated or fully appraised from available\ndata. Some systems are however both hard to simulate and very sensitive to\nsmall perturbations. An additional difficulty arises when a RL agent is trained\noffline to be part of a multi-agent system using only anonymous data, which\nmakes it impossible to infer the state of each agent, thus to use data\ndirectly. Typical examples are competitive systems without agent-resolved data\nsuch as financial markets. We introduce consistent data time travel for offline\nRL as a remedy for these problems: instead of using historical data in a\nsequential way, we argue that one needs to perform time travel in historical\ndata, i.e., to adjust the time index so that both the past state and the\ninfluence of the RL agent's action on the system coincide with real data. This\nboth alleviates the need to resort to imperfect models and consistently\naccounts for both the immediate and long-term reactions of the system when\nusing anonymous historical data. We apply this idea to market making in limit\norder books, a notoriously difficult task for RL; it turns out that the gain of\nthe agent is significantly higher with data time travel than with naive\nsequential data, which suggests that the difficulty of this task for RL may\nhave been overestimated.", "published": "2024-08-05 09:07:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02322v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Machine Learning-based Relative Valuation of Municipal Bonds", "abstract": "The trading ecosystem of the Municipal (muni) bond is complex and unique.\nWith nearly 2\\% of securities from over a million securities outstanding\ntrading daily, determining the value or relative value of a bond among its\npeers is challenging. Traditionally, relative value calculation has been done\nusing rule-based or heuristics-driven approaches, which may introduce human\nbiases and often fail to account for complex relationships between the bond\ncharacteristics. We propose a data-driven model to develop a supervised\nsimilarity framework for the muni bond market based on CatBoost algorithm. This\nalgorithm learns from a large-scale dataset to identify bonds that are similar\nto each other based on their risk profiles. This allows us to evaluate the\nprice of a muni bond relative to a cohort of bonds with a similar risk profile.\nWe propose and deploy a back-testing methodology to compare various benchmarks\nand the proposed methods and show that the similarity-based method outperforms\nboth rule-based and heuristic-based methods.", "published": "2024-08-05 07:05:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02273v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
