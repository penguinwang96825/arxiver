{"title": "Practice in Synonym Extraction at Large Scale", "abstract": "Synonym extraction is an important task in natural language processing and\noften used as a submodule in query expansion, question answering and other\napplications. Automatic synonym extractor is highly preferred for large scale\napplications. Previous studies in synonym extraction are most limited to small\nscale datasets. In this paper, we build a large dataset with 3.4 million\nsynonym/non-synonym pairs to capture the challenges in real world scenarios. We\nproposed (1) a new cost function to accommodate the unbalanced learning\nproblem, and (2) a feature learning based deep neural network to model the\ncomplicated relationships in synonym pairs. We compare several different\napproaches based on SVMs and neural networks, and find out a novel feature\nlearning based neural network outperforms the methods with hand-assigned\nfeatures. Specifically, the best performance of our model surpasses the SVM\nbaseline with a significant 97\\% relative improvement.", "published": "2014-12-06 04:40:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2197v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
