{"title": "Suffix Stripping Problem as an Optimization Problem", "abstract": "Stemming or suffix stripping, an important part of the modern Information\nRetrieval systems, is to find the root word (stem) out of a given cluster of\nwords. Existing algorithms targeting this problem have been developed in a\nhaphazard manner. In this work, we model this problem as an optimization\nproblem. An Integer Program is being developed to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe existing approaches. The sample results of the proposed method are also\nbeing compared with an established technique in the field for English language.\nAn AMPL code for the same IP has also been given.", "published": "2013-12-24 12:06:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6802v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A Subband-Based SVM Front-End for Robust ASR", "abstract": "This work proposes a novel support vector machine (SVM) based robust\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) front-end that operates on an ensemble of\nthe subband components of high-dimensional acoustic waveforms. The key issues\nof selecting the appropriate SVM kernels for classification in frequency\nsubbands and the combination of individual subband classifiers using ensemble\nmethods are addressed. The proposed front-end is compared with state-of-the-art\nASR front-ends in terms of robustness to additive noise and linear filtering.\nExperiments performed on the TIMIT phoneme classification task demonstrate the\nbenefits of the proposed subband based SVM front-end: it outperforms the\nstandard cepstral front-end in the presence of noise and linear filtering for\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 12-dB. A combination of the proposed\nfront-end with a conventional front-end such as MFCC yields further\nimprovements over the individual front ends across the full range of noise\nlevels.", "published": "2013-12-24 08:45:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3322v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Speech Recognition Front End Without Information Loss", "abstract": "Speech representation and modelling in high-dimensional spaces of acoustic\nwaveforms, or a linear transformation thereof, is investigated with the aim of\nimproving the robustness of automatic speech recognition to additive noise. The\nmotivation behind this approach is twofold: (i) the information in acoustic\nwaveforms that is usually removed in the process of extracting low-dimensional\nfeatures might aid robust recognition by virtue of structured redundancy\nanalogous to channel coding, (ii) linear feature domains allow for exact noise\nadaptation, as opposed to representations that involve non-linear processing\nwhich makes noise adaptation challenging. Thus, we develop a generative\nframework for phoneme modelling in high-dimensional linear feature domains, and\nuse it in phoneme classification and recognition tasks. Results show that\nclassification and recognition in this framework perform better than analogous\nPLP and MFCC classifiers below 18 dB SNR. A combination of the high-dimensional\nand MFCC features at the likelihood level performs uniformly better than either\nof the individual representations across all noise levels.", "published": "2013-12-24 16:36:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6849v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
