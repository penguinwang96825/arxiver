{"title": "Well-indumatched Trees and Graphs of Bounded Girth", "abstract": "A graph G is called well-indumatched if all of its maximal induced matchings have the same size. In this paper we characterize all well-indumatched trees. We provide a linear time algorithm to decide if a tree is well-indumatched or not. Then, we characterize minimal well-indumatched graphs of girth at least 9 and show subsequently that for an odd integer g greater than or equal to 9 and different from 11, there is no well-indumatched graph of girth g. On the other hand, there are infinitely many well-indumatched unicyclic graphs of girth k, where k is in {3, 5, 7} or k is an even integer greater than 2. We also show that, although the recognition of well-indumatched graphs is known to be co-NP-complete in general, one can recognize in polynomial time well-indumatched graphs where the size of maximal induced matchings is fixed.", "published": "2019-03-07 21:57:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03197v2", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Convergence of Multi-Agent Learning with a Finite Step Size in General-Sum Games", "abstract": "Learning in a multi-agent system is challenging because agents are simultaneously learning and the environment is not stationary, undermining convergence guarantees. To address this challenge, this paper presents a new gradient-based learning algorithm, called Gradient Ascent with Shrinking Policy Prediction (GA-SPP), which augments the basic gradient ascent approach with the concept of shrinking policy prediction. The key idea behind this algorithm is that an agent adjusts its strategy in response to the forecasted strategy of the other agent, instead of its current one. GA-SPP is shown formally to have Nash convergence in larger settings than existing gradient-based multi-agent learning methods. Furthermore, unlike existing gradient-based methods, GA-SPP's theoretical guarantees do not assume the learning rate to be infinitesimal.", "published": "2019-03-07 12:23:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02868v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
