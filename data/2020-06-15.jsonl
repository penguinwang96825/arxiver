{"title": "Intelligent Decision Support System for Updating Control Plans", "abstract": "In the current competitive environment, it is crucial for manufacturers to make the best decisions in the shortest time, in order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the manufacturing systems. These decisions reach from the strategic level to tactical and operational production planning and control. In this context, elaborating intelligent decisions support systems (DSS) that are capable of integrating a wide variety of models along with data and knowledge resources has become promising. This paper proposes an intelligent DSS for quality control planning. The DSS is a recommender system (RS) that helps the decision maker to select the best control scenario using two different approaches. The first is a manual choice using a multi-criteria decision making method. The second is an automatic recommendation based on case-based reasoning (CBR) technique. Furthermore, the proposed RS makes it possible to continuously update the control plans in order to be adapted to the actual process quality situation. In so doing, CBR is used for learning the required knowledge in order to improve the decision quality. A numerical application is performed in a real case study in order to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed DSS.", "published": "2020-06-15 06:16:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08153v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
