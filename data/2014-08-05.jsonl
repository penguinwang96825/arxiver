{"title": "Speech earthquakes: scaling and universality in human voice", "abstract": "Speech is a distinctive complex feature of human capabilities. In order to\nunderstand the physics underlying speech production, in this work we\nempirically analyse the statistics of large human speech datasets ranging\nseveral languages. We first show that during speech the energy is unevenly\nreleased and power-law distributed, reporting a universal robust\nGutenberg-Richter-like law in speech. We further show that such earthquakes in\nspeech show temporal correlations, as the interevent statistics are again\npower-law distributed. Since this feature takes place in the intra-phoneme\nrange, we conjecture that the responsible for this complex phenomenon is not\ncognitive, but it resides on the physiological speech production mechanism.\nMoreover, we show that these waiting time distributions are scale invariant\nunder a renormalisation group transformation, suggesting that the process of\nspeech generation is indeed operating close to a critical point. These results\nare put in contrast with current paradigms in speech processing, which point\ntowards low dimensional deterministic chaos as the origin of nonlinear traits\nin speech fluctuations. As these latter fluctuations are indeed the aspects\nthat humanize synthetic speech, these findings may have an impact in future\nspeech synthesis technologies. Results are robust and independent of the\ncommunication language or the number of speakers, pointing towards an universal\npattern and yet another hint of complexity in human speech.", "published": "2014-08-05 14:34:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0985v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "q-bio.NC"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
