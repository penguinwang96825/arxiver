{"title": "Evaluation Evaluation a Monte Carlo study", "abstract": "Over the last decade there has been increasing concern about the biases\nembodied in traditional evaluation methods for Natural Language\nProcessing/Learning, particularly methods borrowed from Information Retrieval.\nWithout knowledge of the Bias and Prevalence of the contingency being tested,\nor equivalently the expectation due to chance, the simple conditional\nprobabilities Recall, Precision and Accuracy are not meaningful as evaluation\nmeasures, either individually or in combinations such as F-factor. The\nexistence of bias in NLP measures leads to the 'improvement' of systems by\nincreasing their bias, such as the practice of improving tagging and parsing\nscores by using most common value (e.g. water is always a Noun) rather than the\nattempting to discover the correct one. The measures Cohen Kappa and Powers\nInformedness are discussed as unbiased alternative to Recall and related to the\npsychologically significant measure DeltaP. In this paper we will analyze both\nbiased and unbiased measures theoretically, characterizing the precise\nrelationship between all these measures as well as evaluating the evaluation\nmeasures themselves empirically using a Monte Carlo simulation.", "published": "2015-04-03 14:46:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00854v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
