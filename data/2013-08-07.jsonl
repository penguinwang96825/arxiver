{"title": "Logical analysis of natural language semantics to solve the problem of\n  computer understanding", "abstract": "An object--oriented approach to create a natural language understanding\nsystem is considered. The understanding program is a formal system built on the\nbase of predicative calculus. Horn's clauses are used as well--formed formulas.\nAn inference is based on the principle of resolution. Sentences of natural\nlanguage are represented in the view of typical predicate set. These predicates\ndescribe physical objects and processes, abstract objects, categories and\nsemantic relations between objects. Predicates for concrete assertions are\nsaved in a database. To describe the semantics of classes for physical objects,\nabstract concepts and processes, a knowledge base is applied. The proposed\nrepresentation of natural language sentences is a semantic net. Nodes of such\nnet are typical predicates. This approach is perspective as, firstly, such\ntypification of nodes facilitates essentially forming of processing algorithms\nand object descriptions, secondly, the effectiveness of algorithms is increased\n(particularly for the great number of nodes), thirdly, to describe the\nsemantics of words, encyclopedic knowledge is used, and this permits\nessentially to extend the class of solved problems.", "published": "2013-08-07 09:09:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1507v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
