{"title": "Arabizi Detection and Conversion to Arabic", "abstract": "Arabizi is Arabic text that is written using Latin characters. Arabizi is\nused to present both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Arabic dialects. It is\ncommonly used in informal settings such as social networking sites and is often\nwith mixed with English. In this paper we address the problems of: identifying\nArabizi in text and converting it to Arabic characters. We used word and\nsequence-level features to identify Arabizi that is mixed with English. We\nachieved an identification accuracy of 98.5%. As for conversion, we used\ntransliteration mining with language modeling to generate equivalent Arabic\ntext. We achieved 88.7% conversion accuracy, with roughly a third of errors\nbeing spelling and morphological variants of the forms in ground truth.", "published": "2013-06-28 08:46:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6755v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
