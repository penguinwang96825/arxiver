{"title": "Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better", "abstract": "Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision\nsolely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality\ninto the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension.

We introduce a frequency\nconsistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action\nfeatures across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting\nconvergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In\naddition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal\nvariations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks.

Fingerprinting and black-box\nwatermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining\nmodel similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership\ncollisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning.\nThe latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of\nbackdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do\nnot convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires\na unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the\nsuspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost\nand the risk of detection.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box\nwatermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as\nthe ownership information without using backdoors.

{"title": "MOBODY: Model Based Off-Dynamics Offline Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the\ngoal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and\ntarget domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL\nmethods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the\ntarget domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by\nthe limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the\nlearned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.\nWe propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that\naddresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via\nlearned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target\ndomain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during\noffline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn\ndynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched\ndynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these\ndatasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that\nregularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather\nthan uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned\nfrom an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented\nsource data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics.

Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token\nflows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame\ncontexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment\ninformation via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal\noverhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we\nintroduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches\narising from different diffusion sampling steps.

Three critical design challenges need to be resolved to\nachieve this incentive loop: Matthew Effect in the consumer feedback-loop,\nunclear relation between hotel quality and performance, and conflicts between\nshort-term and long-term revenue. To address these challenges, we propose\nMERIT, a MERchant IncenTive ranking model, which can simultaneously take the\ninterests of merchants and consumers into account.

{"title": "Optimization over Sparse Support-Preserving Sets: Two-Step Projection with Global Optimality Guarantees", "abstract": "In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\\ell_0$\npseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex\nrelaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity\nconstraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been\ndeveloped to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex\nconstraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed\nconstraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of\nconvergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in\nsparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of\nsparse optimization with extra \\qw{\\textit{support-preserving}} constraints\ncommonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative\nhard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection\noperator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple\nalternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By\nintroducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,\nwe provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our\nalgorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under\nthe conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a\nfundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of\nthe classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection\noperator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an\nelegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques.

In practice,\nhowever, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,\nsurprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we\nexplain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes\nuse of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov\nprocesses: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed\nrate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in\nthe known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to.

In this work, we identify three pitfalls in\nexisting standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them\nimpacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance\nfor aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text\nstandardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR\nperformance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be\nconsistent with how users - especially those from marginalized speech\ncommunities - would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second,\naudits often display high-level demographic findings without further\nconsidering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic\nsubgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the\ninput audio.
