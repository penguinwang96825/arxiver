{"title": "Multilingual Open Relation Extraction Using Cross-lingual Projection", "abstract": "Open domain relation extraction systems identify relation and argument\nphrases in a sentence without relying on any underlying schema. However,\ncurrent state-of-the-art relation extraction systems are available only for\nEnglish because of their heavy reliance on linguistic tools such as\npart-of-speech taggers and dependency parsers. We present a cross-lingual\nannotation projection method for language independent relation extraction. We\nevaluate our method on a manually annotated test set and present results on\nthree typologically different languages. We release these manual annotations\nand extracted relations in 61 languages from Wikipedia.", "published": "2015-03-22 18:05:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06450v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
