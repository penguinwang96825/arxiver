{"title": "Verbs Taking Clausal and Non-Finite Arguments as Signals of Modality -\n  Revisiting the Issue of Meaning Grounded in Syntax", "abstract": "We revisit Levin's theory about the correspondence of verb meaning and syntax\nand infer semantic classes from a large syntactic classification of more than\n600 German verbs taking clausal and non-finite arguments. Grasping the meaning\ncomponents of Levin-classes is known to be hard. We address this challenge by\nsetting up a multi-perspective semantic characterization of the inferred\nclasses. To this end, we link the inferred classes and their English\ntranslation to independently constructed semantic classes in three different\nlexicons - the German wordnet GermaNet, VerbNet and FrameNet - and perform a\ndetailed analysis and evaluation of the resulting German-English classification\n(available at www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/modality-verbclasses/).", "published": "2015-09-11 13:05:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03488v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Parallel Corpus of Translationese", "abstract": "We describe a set of bilingual English--French and English--German parallel\ncorpora in which the direction of translation is accurately and reliably\nannotated. The corpora are diverse, consisting of parliamentary proceedings,\nliterary works, transcriptions of TED talks and political commentary. They will\nbe instrumental for research of translationese and its applications to (human\nand machine) translation; specifically, they can be used for the task of\ntranslationese identification, a research direction that enjoys a growing\ninterest in recent years. To validate the quality and reliability of the\ncorpora, we replicated previous results of supervised and unsupervised\nidentification of translationese, and further extended the experiments to\nadditional datasets and languages.", "published": "2015-09-11 19:07:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03611v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
