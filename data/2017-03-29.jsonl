{"title": "Hierarchical Classification for Spoken Arabic Dialect Identification\n  using Prosody: Case of Algerian Dialects", "abstract": "In daily communications, Arabs use local dialects which are hard to identify\nautomatically using conventional classification methods. The dialect\nidentification challenging task becomes more complicated when dealing with an\nunder-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region. In this paper, we\nstart by analyzing statistically Algerian dialects in order to capture their\nspecificities related to prosody information which are extracted at utterance\nlevel after a coarse-grained consonant/vowel segmentation. According to these\nanalysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken\nArabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID). It takes advantage from the\nfact that dialects have an inherent property of naturally structured into\nhierarchy. Within HADID, a top-down hierarchical classification is applied, in\nwhich we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) method to build a local classifier for\nevery parent node into the hierarchy dialect structure. Our framework is\nimplemented and evaluated on Algerian Arabic dialects corpus. Whereas, the\nhierarchy dialect structure is deduced from historic and linguistic knowledges.\nThe results reveal that within {\\HD}, the best classifier is DNNs compared to\nSupport Vector Machine. In addition, compared with a baseline Flat\nclassification system, our HADID gives an improvement of 63.5% in term of\nprecision. Furthermore, overall results evidence the suitability of our\nprosody-based HADID for speaker independent dialect identification while\nrequiring less than 6s test utterances.", "published": "2017-03-29 14:26:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10065v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Automatic Argumentative-Zoning Using Word2vec", "abstract": "In comparison with document summarization on the articles from social media\nand newswire, argumentative zoning (AZ) is an important task in scientific\npaper analysis. Traditional methodology to carry on this task relies on feature\nengineering from different levels. In this paper, three models of generating\nsentence vectors for the task of sentence classification were explored and\ncompared. The proposed approach builds sentence representations using learned\nembeddings based on neural network. The learned word embeddings formed a\nfeature space, to which the examined sentence is mapped to. Those features are\ninput into the classifiers for supervised classification. Using\n10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on the\nArgumentative-Zoning (AZ) annotated articles. The results showed that simply\naveraging the word vectors in a sentence works better than the paragraph to\nvector algorithm and by integrating specific cuewords into the loss function of\nthe neural network can improve the classification performance. In comparison\nwith the hand-crafted features, the word2vec method won for most of the\ncategories. However, the hand-crafted features showed their strength on\nclassifying some of the categories.", "published": "2017-03-29 17:33:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10152v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Colors in Context: A Pragmatic Neural Model for Grounded Language\n  Understanding", "abstract": "We present a model of pragmatic referring expression interpretation in a\ngrounded communication task (identifying colors from descriptions) that draws\nupon predictions from two recurrent neural network classifiers, a speaker and a\nlistener, unified by a recursive pragmatic reasoning framework. Experiments\nshow that this combined pragmatic model interprets color descriptions more\naccurately than the classifiers from which it is built, and that much of this\nimprovement results from combining the speaker and listener perspectives. We\nobserve that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the\nmodel must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately\nexpress the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of\nhuman utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic\nbehaviors. We also show that the embedded speaker model reproduces many of\nthese pragmatic behaviors.", "published": "2017-03-29 18:15:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10186v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis", "abstract": "A text-to-speech synthesis system typically consists of multiple stages, such\nas a text analysis frontend, an acoustic model and an audio synthesis module.\nBuilding these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may\ncontain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an\nend-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly\nfrom characters. Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely\nfrom scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to\nmake the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task.\nTacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English,\noutperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In\naddition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's\nsubstantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.", "published": "2017-03-29 16:55:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
