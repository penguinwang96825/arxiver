{"title": "SusGen-GPT: A Data-Centric LLM for Financial NLP and Sustainability Report Generation", "abstract": "The rapid growth of the financial sector and the rising focus on\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations highlight the need\nfor advanced NLP tools. However, open-source LLMs proficient in both finance\nand ESG domains remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce SusGen-30K, a\ncategory-balanced dataset comprising seven financial NLP tasks and ESG report\ngeneration, and propose TCFD-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating sustainability\nreport generation. Leveraging this dataset, we developed SusGen-GPT, a suite of\nmodels achieving state-of-the-art performance across six adapted and two\noff-the-shelf tasks, trailing GPT-4 by only 2% despite using 7-8B parameters\ncompared to GPT-4's 1,700B. Based on this, we propose the SusGen system,\nintegrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to assist in\nsustainability report generation. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our\napproach, advancing research in finance and ESG.", "published": "2024-12-14 17:30:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10906v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CE", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs", "abstract": "Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of\nnews on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely\nadopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities.\nHowever, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its\ndissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements.\nAdditionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and\nexplicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret\nnews. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances\nLLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news\ndissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster\nrecent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching\nprompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting\nshort-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our\napproach improves prediction accuracy by 8\\% compared to existing methods.", "published": "2024-12-14 13:04:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10823v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Continuous-time optimal investment with portfolio constraints: a reinforcement learning approach", "abstract": "In a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we study the exploratory version\nof the continuous time expected utility (EU) maximization problem with a\nportfolio constraint that includes widely-used financial regulations such as\nshort-selling constraints and borrowing prohibition. The optimal feedback\npolicy of the exploratory unconstrained classical EU problem is shown to be\nGaussian. In the case where the portfolio weight is constrained to a given\ninterval, the corresponding constrained optimal exploratory policy follows a\ntruncated Gaussian distribution. We verify that the closed form optimal\nsolution obtained for logarithmic utility and quadratic utility for both\nunconstrained and constrained situations converge to the non-exploratory\nexpected utility counterpart when the exploration weight goes to zero. Finally,\nwe establish a policy improvement theorem and devise an implementable\nreinforcement learning algorithm by casting the optimal problem in a martingale\nframework. Our numerical examples show that exploration leads to an optimal\nwealth process that is more dispersedly distributed with heavier tail compared\nto that of the case without exploration. This effect becomes less significant\nas the exploration parameter is smaller. Moreover, the numerical implementation\nalso confirms the intuitive understanding that a broader domain of investment\nopportunities necessitates a higher exploration cost. Notably, when subjected\nto both short-selling and money borrowing constraints, the exploration cost\nbecomes negligible compared to the unconstrained case.", "published": "2024-12-14 05:35:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10692v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "34D20, 60H10, 92D25, 93D05, 93D20"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}

{"title": "Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Optimal Control of Execution Costs", "abstract": "Bertsimas and Lo's seminal work laid the groundwork for addressing the\nimplementation shortfall dilemma in institutional investing, emphasizing the\nsignificance of market microstructure and price dynamics in minimizing\nexecution costs. However, the ability to derive a theoretical Optimum market\norder policy is an unrealistic assumption for many investors. This study aims\nto bridge this gap by proposing an approach that leverages stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) to derive alternative solutions for optimizing execution cost\npolicies in dynamic markets where explicit mathematical solutions may not yet\nexist. The proposed methodology assumes the existence of a mathematically\nderived optimal solution that is a function of the underlying market dynamics.\nBy iteratively refining strategies using SGD, economists can adapt their\napproaches over time based on evolving execution strategies. While these\nSGD-based solutions may not achieve optimality, they offer valuable insights\ninto optimizing policies under complex market frameworks.
