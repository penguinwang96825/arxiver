We study the applicability of quantum kernels to financial data,\nspecifically our self-curated Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSEx) Broad Index dataset.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the very first systematic research work\non this dataset on the application of quantum kernel. We report empirical\nquantum advantage in our work, using several quantum kernels and proposing the\nbest one for this dataset while verifying the Phase Space Terrain Ruggedness\nIndex metric.

{"title": "Stochastic Gradient Descent in the Optimal Control of Execution Costs", "abstract": "Bertsimas and Lo's seminal work laid the groundwork for addressing the\nimplementation shortfall dilemma in institutional investing, emphasizing the\nsignificance of market microstructure and price dynamics in minimizing\nexecution costs. However, the ability to derive a theoretical Optimum market\norder policy is an unrealistic assumption for many investors. This study aims\nto bridge this gap by proposing an approach that leverages stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) to derive alternative solutions for optimizing execution cost\npolicies in dynamic markets where explicit mathematical solutions may not yet\nexist. The proposed methodology assumes the existence of a mathematically\nderived optimal solution that is a function of the underlying market dynamics.\nBy iteratively refining strategies using SGD, economists can adapt their\napproaches over time based on evolving execution strategies. While these\nSGD-based solutions may not achieve optimality, they offer valuable insights\ninto optimizing policies under complex market frameworks. These results serve\nas a bridge for economists and mathematicians, facilitating the study of the\nOptimum policy volatile markets while offering SGD driven implementable\npolicies that closely approximate optimal outcomes within shorter time frames.", "published": "2024-12-14 19:54:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12199v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Auto-Regressive Control of Execution Costs", "abstract": "Bertsimas and Lo's seminal work established a foundational framework for\naddressing the implementation shortfall dilemma faced by large institutional\ninvestors. Their models emphasized the critical role of accurate knowledge of\nmarket microstructure and price/information dynamics in optimizing trades to\nminimize execution costs. However, this paper recognizes that perfect initial\nknowledge may not be a realistic assumption for new investors entering the\nmarket. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by proposing an approach\nthat iteratively derives OLS estimates of the market parameters from period to\nperiod. This methodology enables uninformed investors to engage in the market\ndynamically, adjusting their strategies over time based on evolving estimates,\nthus offering a practical solution for navigating the complexities of execution\ncost optimization without perfect initial knowledge.", "published": "2024-12-14 19:52:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10947v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs", "abstract": "Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of\nnews on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely\nadopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities.\nHowever, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its\ndissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements.\nAdditionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and\nexplicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret\nnews. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances\nLLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news\ndissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster\nrecent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching\nprompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting\nshort-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our\napproach improves prediction accuracy by 8\\% compared to existing methods.", "published": "2024-12-14 13:04:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10823v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
