{"title": "Boosting the Accuracy of Stock Market Prediction via Multi-Layer Hybrid MTL Structure", "abstract": "Accurate stock market prediction provides great opportunities for informed\ndecision-making, yet existing methods struggle with financial data's\nnon-linear, high-dimensional, and volatile characteristics. Advanced predictive\nmodels are needed to effectively address these complexities. This paper\nproposes a novel multi-layer hybrid multi-task learning (MTL) framework aimed\nat achieving more efficient stock market predictions. It involves a Transformer\nencoder to extract complex correspondences between various input features, a\nBidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to capture long-term temporal\nrelationships, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to enhance the learning\nprocess. Experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed learning structure\nachieves great performance, with an MAE as low as 1.078, a MAPE as low as\n0.012, and an R^2 as high as 0.98, when compared with other competitive\nnetworks.", "published": "2025-01-01 17:47:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09760v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Automated Crypto Portfolio Management", "abstract": "Cryptocurrency investment is inherently difficult due to its shorter history\ncompared to traditional assets, the need to integrate vast amounts of data from\nvarious modalities, and the requirement for complex reasoning. While deep\nlearning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their\nblack-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently,\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due\nto their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable\ndecisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive\ntasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in\ncryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in\ntheir training corpora.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal,\nmulti-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses\nspecialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks\nsuch as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making\nfor the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training\nmodule fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional\ninvestment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs\nreal-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique\nintrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by\nadjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and\nfacilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data\nfrom November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework\noutperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset\npricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.", "published": "2025-01-01 13:08:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00826v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
