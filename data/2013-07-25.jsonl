We discuss several shortcomings of their approach\nand critique: their model critically rests on inaccurate assumptions, is\nincapable of explaining key surprisal patterns in language, and is incompatible\nwith recent behavioral results. More generally, we argue that statistical\nmodels must not critically rely on assumptions that are incompatible with the\nreal system under study.", "published": "2013-07-25 12:53:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6726v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.PR", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
