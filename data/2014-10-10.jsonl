{"title": "An Ontology for Comprehensive Tutoring of Euphonic Conjunctions of\n  Sanskrit Grammar", "abstract": "Euphonic conjunctions (sandhis) form a very important aspect of Sanskrit\nmorphology and phonology. The traditional and modern methods of studying about\neuphonic conjunctions in Sanskrit follow different methodologies. The former\ninvolves a rigorous study of the Paninian system embodied in Panini's\nAshtadhyayi, while the latter usually involves the study of a few important\nsandhi rules with the use of examples. The former is not suitable for\nbeginners, and the latter, not sufficient to gain a comprehensive understanding\nof the operation of sandhi rules. This is so since there are not only numerous\nsandhi rules and exceptions, but also complex precedence rules involved. The\nneed for a new ontology for sandhi-tutoring was hence felt. This work presents\na comprehensive ontology designed to enable a student-user to learn in stages\nall about euphonic conjunctions and the relevant aphorisms of Sanskrit grammar\nand to test and evaluate the progress of the student-user. The ontology forms\nthe basis of a multimedia sandhi tutor that was given to different categories\nof users including Sanskrit scholars for extensive and rigorous testing.", "published": "2014-10-10 19:19:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2871v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Polarization Measurement of High Dimensional Social Media Messages With\n  Support Vector Machine Algorithm Using Mapreduce", "abstract": "In this article, we propose a new Support Vector Machine (SVM) training\nalgorithm based on distributed MapReduce technique. In literature, there are a\nlots of research that shows us SVM has highest generalization property among\nclassification algorithms used in machine learning area. Also, SVM classifier\nmodel is not affected by correlations of the features. But SVM uses quadratic\noptimization techniques in its training phase. The SVM algorithm is formulated\nas quadratic optimization problem. Quadratic optimization problem has $O(m^3)$\ntime and $O(m^2)$ space complexity, where m is the training set size. The\ncomputation time of SVM training is quadratic in the number of training\ninstances. In this reason, SVM is not a suitable classification algorithm for\nlarge scale dataset classification. To solve this training problem we developed\na new distributed MapReduce method developed. Accordingly, (i) SVM algorithm is\ntrained in distributed dataset individually; (ii) then merge all support\nvectors of classifier model in every trained node; and (iii) iterate these two\nsteps until the classifier model converges to the optimal classifier function.\nIn the implementation phase, large scale social media dataset is presented in\nTFxIDF matrix. The matrix is used for sentiment analysis to get polarization\nvalue. Two and three class models are created for classification method.\nConfusion matrices of each classification model are presented in tables. Social\nmedia messages corpus consists of 108 public and 66 private universities\nmessages in Turkey. Twitter is used for source of corpus. Twitter user messages\nare collected using Twitter Streaming API. Results are shown in graphics and\ntables.", "published": "2014-10-10 06:42:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2686v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Riesz Logic", "abstract": "We introduce Riesz Logic, whose models are abelian lattice ordered groups,\nwhich generalise Riesz spaces (vector lattices), and show soundness and\ncompleteness. Our motivation is to provide a logic for distributional semantics\nof natural language, where words are typically represented as elements of a\nvector space whose dimensions correspond to contexts in which words may occur.\nThis basis provides a lattice ordering on the space, and this ordering may be\ninterpreted as \"distributional entailment\". Several axioms of Riesz Logic are\nfamiliar from Basic Fuzzy Logic, and we show how the models of these two logics\nmay be related; Riesz Logic may thus be considered a new fuzzy logic. In\naddition to applications in natural language processing, there is potential for\napplying the theory to neuro-fuzzy systems.", "published": "2014-10-10 21:14:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2910v1", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LO"}
