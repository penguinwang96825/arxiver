{"title": "A fast method for pricing American options under the variance gamma model", "abstract": "We investigate methods for pricing American options under the variance gamma model. The variance gamma process is a pure jump process which is constructed by replacing the calendar time by the gamma time in a Brownian motion with drift, which makes it a time-changed Brownian motion. In general, the finite difference method and the simulation method can be used for pricing under this model, but their speed is not satisfactory. So there is a need for fast but accurate approximation methods. In the case of Black-Merton-Scholes model, there are fast approximation methods, but they cannot be utilized for the variance gamma model. We develop a new fast method inspired by the quadratic approximation method, while reducing the error by making use of a machine learning technique on pre-calculated quantities. We compare the performance of our proposed method with those of the existing methods and show that this method is efficient and accurate for practical use.", "published": "2019-03-18 15:49:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07519v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
