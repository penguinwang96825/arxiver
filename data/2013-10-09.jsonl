{"title": "Improved Bayesian Logistic Supervised Topic Models with Data\n  Augmentation", "abstract": "Supervised topic models with a logistic likelihood have two issues that\npotentially limit their practical use: 1) response variables are usually\nover-weighted by document word counts; and 2) existing variational inference\nmethods make strict mean-field assumptions. We address these issues by: 1)\nintroducing a regularization constant to better balance the two parts based on\nan optimization formulation of Bayesian inference; and 2) developing a simple\nGibbs sampling algorithm by introducing auxiliary Polya-Gamma variables and\ncollapsing out Dirichlet variables. Our augment-and-collapse sampling algorithm\nhas analytical forms of each conditional distribution without making any\nrestricting assumptions and can be easily parallelized. Empirical results\ndemonstrate significant improvements on prediction performance and time\nefficiency.", "published": "2013-10-09 09:23:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2408v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.AP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Spatio-temporal variation of conversational utterances on Twitter", "abstract": "Conversations reflect the existing norms of a language. Previously, we found\nthat utterance lengths in English fictional conversations in books and movies\nhave shortened over a period of 200 years. In this work, we show that this\nshortening occurs even for a brief period of 3 years (September 2009-December\n2012) using 229 million utterances from Twitter. Furthermore, the subset of\ngeographically-tagged tweets from the United States show an inverse proportion\nbetween utterance lengths and the state-level percentage of the Black\npopulation. We argue that shortening of utterances can be explained by the\nincreasing usage of jargon including coined words.", "published": "2013-10-09 13:38:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2479v3", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
