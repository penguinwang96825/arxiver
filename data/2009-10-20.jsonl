{"title": "Admissible Strategies in Semimartingale Portfolio Selection", "abstract": "The choice of admissible trading strategies in mathematical modelling of financial markets is a delicate issue, going back to Harrison and Kreps (1979). In the context of optimal portfolio selection with expected utility preferences this question has been a focus of considerable attention over the last twenty years. We propose a novel notion of admissibility that has many pleasant features - admissibility is characterized purely under the objective measure; each admissible strategy can be approximated by simple strategies using finite number of trading dates; the wealth of any admissible strategy is a supermartingale under all pricing measures; local boundedness of the price process is not required; neither strict monotonicity, strict concavity nor differentiability of the utility function are necessary; the definition encompasses both the classical mean-variance preferences and the monotone expected utility. For utility functions finite on the whole real line, our class represents a minimal set containing simple strategies which also contains the optimizer, under conditions that are milder than the celebrated reasonable asymptotic elasticity condition on the utility function.", "published": "2009-10-20 19:51:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.3936v5", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.OC", "math.PR", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
