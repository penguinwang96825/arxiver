{"title": "Punjabi Language Interface to Database: a brief review", "abstract": "Unlike most user-computer interfaces, a natural language interface allows\nusers to communicate fluently with a computer system with very little\npreparation. Databases are often hard to use in cooperating with the users\nbecause of their rigid interface. A good NLIDB allows a user to enter commands\nand ask questions in native language and then after interpreting respond to the\nuser in native language. For a large number of applications requiring\ninteraction between humans and the computer systems, it would be convenient to\nprovide the end-user friendly interface. Punjabi language interface to database\nwould proof fruitful to native people of Punjab, as it provides ease to them to\nuse various e-governance applications like Punjab Sewa, Suwidha, Online Public\nUtility Forms, Online Grievance Cell, Land Records Management System,legacy\nmatters, e-District, agriculture, etc. Punjabi is the mother tongue of more\nthan 110 million people all around the world. According to available\ninformation, Punjabi ranks 10th from top out of a total of 6,900 languages\nrecognized internationally by the United Nations. This paper covers a brief\noverview of the Natural language interface to database, its different\ncomponents, its advantages, disadvantages, approaches and techniques used. The\npaper ends with the work done on Punjabi language interface to database and\nfuture enhancements that can be done.", "published": "2013-06-18 11:03:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4139v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
