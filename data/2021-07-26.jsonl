{"title": "Bitcoin option pricing: A market attention approach", "abstract": "A model is proposed for Bitcoin prices that takes into account market attention. Market attention, modeled by a mean-reverting Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes, affects the volatility of Bitcoin returns, with some delay. The model is affine and tractable, with closed formulae for the conditional characteristic functions with respect to both the conventional and a delayed filtration. This leads to semi-closed formulae for European call and put prices. A maximum likelihood estimation procedure is provided, as well as a method for changing to a risk-neutral measure. The model compares very well against classical and attention-based models when tested on real data.", "published": "2021-07-26 19:25:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12447v3", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
{"title": "Inverse and Quanto Inverse Options in a Black-Scholes World", "abstract": "Over 90% of exchange trading on crypto options has always been on the Deribit platform. This centralised crypto exchange only lists inverse products because they do not accept fiat currency. Currently, fiat-based traders can only make deposits in bitcoin, although they can withdraw both bitcoin and ether to their on-chain wallets. Likewise, other major crypto options platforms only list crypto--stablecoin trading pairs in so-called direct options, which are similar to the standard crypto options listed by the CME except the U.S. dollar is replaced by a stablecoin version. Until now a clear mathematical exposition of these products has been lacking. We discuss the sources of market incompleteness in direct and inverse options and compare their pricing and hedging characteristics. Then we discuss the useful applications of currency protected \"quanto\" direct and inverse options for fiat-based traders and describe their pricing and hedging characteristics, all in the Black-Scholes setting.", "published": "2021-07-26 08:57:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12041v5", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
