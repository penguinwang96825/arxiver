{"title": "A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models", "abstract": "In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for\nreasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success\nin advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing\ncomplex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area.

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple.

In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance.

{"title": "Teamwork as Linear Interpersonal Dynamics", "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which\nindividuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time.

What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation\nthat unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We\npropose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is\nthe transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how\nmuch each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus\nevery other group member's past behaviors.

Finally, we show that our method generalizes across\nmodalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a\nsimple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the\nera of increasing synthetic data.", "published": "2025-09-10 20:06:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08972v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures", "abstract": "Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,\nwhich typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this\nchallenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting\na Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise\nrelationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection\n(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier\nDetection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between\nembedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We\nestablish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta\ndistributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed. The proposed OD\nstep complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,\ncontrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level\nsimilarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising\nand Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and\nvehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\\%),\ndemonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.\nThe implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD", "published": "2025-09-10 18:42:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "math.ST", "stat.ML", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "SFD-Mamba2Net: Structure-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation", "abstract": "Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of\ndeath worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold\nstandard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and\nstenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low\ncontrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,\nwhich pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing\nsegmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the\naccuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images\nby integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range\ndependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.\nMethods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for\nICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a\nCurvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage\nmulti-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,\nsuppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular\nregions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception\n(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively\nrefine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global\nstructures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed\nstate-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the\nhighest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.", "published": "2025-09-10 18:58:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934v2", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners", "abstract": "Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a\nhigh-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical\nsimulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the\nmain applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require\nclassical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness\nand optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in\ndemonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We\nconsider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's\nown data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation.\nConcretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related\nlinear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to\nonline-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g.\npreconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on\ntop of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its\neffectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.", "published": "2025-09-10 16:56:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765v2", "categories": ["physics.comp-ph", "cs.LG", "cs.NA", "math.NA", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "physics.comp-ph"}
{"title": "HypoGeneAgent: A Hypothesis Language Agent for Gene-Set Cluster Resolution Selection Using Perturb-seq Datasets", "abstract": "Large-scale single-cell and Perturb-seq investigations routinely involve\nclustering cells and subsequently annotating each cluster with Gene-Ontology\n(GO) terms to elucidate the underlying biological programs. However, both\nstages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently\nsubjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present\nHYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming\ncluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM\nfunctioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or\nperturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses,\naccompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every\npredicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine\nsimilarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal\nconsistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same\ncluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness,\nlow similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two\nquantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is\nmaximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity.\nWhen applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary\ntest, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit\nalignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette\nscore, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary.
