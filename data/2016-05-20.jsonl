{"title": "Phrase-based Machine Translation is State-of-the-Art for Automatic\n  Grammatical Error Correction", "abstract": "In this work, we study parameter tuning towards the M^2 metric, the standard\nmetric for automatic grammar error correction (GEC) tasks. After implementing\nM^2 as a scorer in the Moses tuning framework, we investigate interactions of\ndense and sparse features, different optimizers, and tuning strategies for the\nCoNLL-2014 shared task. We notice erratic behavior when optimizing sparse\nfeature weights with M^2 and offer partial solutions. We find that a bare-bones\nphrase-based SMT setup with task-specific parameter-tuning outperforms all\npreviously published results for the CoNLL-2014 test set by a large margin\n(46.37% M^2 over previously 41.75%, by an SMT system with neural features)\nwhile being trained on the same, publicly available data. Our newly introduced\ndense and sparse features widen that gap, and we improve the state-of-the-art\nto 49.49% M^2.", "published": "2016-05-20 13:43:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06353v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "As Cool as a Cucumber: Towards a Corpus of Contemporary Similes in\n  Serbian", "abstract": "Similes are natural language expressions used to compare unlikely things,\nwhere the comparison is not taken literally. They are often used in everyday\ncommunication and are an important part of cultural heritage. Having an\nup-to-date corpus of similes is challenging, as they are constantly coined\nand/or adapted to the contemporary times. In this paper we present a\nmethodology for semi-automated collection of similes from the world wide web\nusing text mining techniques. We expanded an existing corpus of traditional\nsimiles (containing 333 similes) by collecting 446 additional expressions. We,\nalso, explore how crowdsourcing can be used to extract and curate new similes.", "published": "2016-05-20 12:20:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06319v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Local communities obstruct global consensus: Naming game on\n  multi-local-world networks", "abstract": "Community structure is essential for social communications, where individuals\nbelonging to the same community are much more actively interacting and\ncommunicating with each other than those in different communities within the\nhuman society. Naming game, on the other hand, is a social communication model\nthat simulates the process of learning a name of an object within a community\nof humans, where the individuals can generally reach global consensus\nasymptotically through iterative pair-wise conversations. The underlying\nnetwork indicates the relationships among the individuals. In this paper, three\ntypical topologies, namely random-graph, small-world and scale-free networks,\nare employed, which are embedded with the multi-local-world community\nstructure, to study the naming game. Simulations show that 1) the convergence\nprocess to global consensus is getting slower as the community structure\nbecomes more prominent, and eventually might fail; 2) if the inter-community\nconnections are sufficiently dense, neither the number nor the size of the\ncommunities affects the convergence process; and 3) for different topologies\nwith the same average node-degree, local clustering of individuals obstruct or\nprohibit global consensus to take place. The results reveal the role of local\ncommunities in a global naming game in social network studies.", "published": "2016-05-20 11:52:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06304v2", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
