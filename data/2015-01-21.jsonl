{"title": "Phrase Based Language Model for Statistical Machine Translation:\n  Empirical Study", "abstract": "Reordering is a challenge to machine translation (MT) systems. In MT, the\nwidely used approach is to apply word based language model (LM) which considers\nthe constituent units of a sentence as words. In speech recognition (SR), some\nphrase based LM have been proposed. However, those LMs are not necessarily\nsuitable or optimal for reordering. We propose two phrase based LMs which\nconsiders the constituent units of a sentence as phrases. Experiments show that\nour phrase based LMs outperform the word based LM with the respect of\nperplexity and n-best list re-ranking.", "published": "2015-01-21 15:48:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05203v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
