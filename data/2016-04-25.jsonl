{"title": "Parsing Argumentation Structures in Persuasive Essays", "abstract": "In this article, we present a novel approach for parsing argumentation\nstructures. We identify argument components using sequence labeling at the\ntoken level and apply a new joint model for detecting argumentation structures.\nThe proposed model globally optimizes argument component types and\nargumentative relations using integer linear programming. We show that our\nmodel considerably improves the performance of base classifiers and\nsignificantly outperforms challenging heuristic baselines. Moreover, we\nintroduce a novel corpus of persuasive essays annotated with argumentation\nstructures. We show that our annotation scheme and annotation guidelines\nsuccessfully guide human annotators to substantial agreement. This corpus and\nthe annotation guidelines are freely available for ensuring reproducibility and\nto encourage future research in computational argumentation.", "published": "2016-04-25 19:19:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07370v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Towards Real-Time, Country-Level Location Classification of Worldwide\n  Tweets", "abstract": "In contrast to much previous work that has focused on location classification\nof tweets restricted to a specific country, here we undertake the task in a\nbroader context by classifying global tweets at the country level, which is so\nfar unexplored in a real-time scenario. We analyse the extent to which a\ntweet's country of origin can be determined by making use of eight\ntweet-inherent features for classification. Furthermore, we use two datasets,\ncollected a year apart from each other, to analyse the extent to which a model\ntrained from historical tweets can still be leveraged for classification of new\ntweets. With classification experiments on all 217 countries in our datasets,\nas well as on the top 25 countries, we offer some insights into the best use of\ntweet-inherent features for an accurate country-level classification of tweets.\nWe find that the use of a single feature, such as the use of tweet content\nalone -- the most widely used feature in previous work -- leaves much to be\ndesired. Choosing an appropriate combination of both tweet content and metadata\ncan actually lead to substantial improvements of between 20\\% and 50\\%. We\nobserve that tweet content, the user's self-reported location and the user's\nreal name, all of which are inherent in a tweet and available in a real-time\nscenario, are particularly useful to determine the country of origin. We also\nexperiment on the applicability of a model trained on historical tweets to\nclassify new tweets, finding that the choice of a particular combination of\nfeatures whose utility does not fade over time can actually lead to comparable\nperformance, avoiding the need to retrain. However, the difficulty of achieving\naccurate classification increases slightly for countries with multiple\ncommonalities, especially for English and Spanish speaking countries.", "published": "2016-04-25 12:50:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07236v3", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Conversational Markers of Constructive Discussions", "abstract": "Group discussions are essential for organizing every aspect of modern life,\nfrom faculty meetings to senate debates, from grant review panels to papal\nconclaves. While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group\ndiscussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to\nsolutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g.\nvoting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However,\nthis assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions\nabounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are\nunproductive.\n  We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to\ndetermine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not. We\nexploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance\nbetween the participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this\nframework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world\nexploration game developed and deployed to support this research. Using this\nsetting, we show that linguistic cues and conversational patterns extracted\nfrom the first 20 seconds of a team discussion are predictive of whether it\nwill be a wasteful or a productive one.", "published": "2016-04-25 20:00:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07407v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
