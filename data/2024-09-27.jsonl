{"title": "Volatility Forecasting in Global Financial Markets Using TimeMixer", "abstract": "Predicting volatility in financial markets, including stocks, index ETFs,\nforeign exchange, and cryptocurrencies, remains a challenging task due to the\ninherent complexity and non-linear dynamics of these time series. In this\nstudy, I apply TimeMixer, a state-of-the-art time series forecasting model, to\npredict the volatility of global financial assets. TimeMixer utilizes a\nmultiscale-mixing approach that effectively captures both short-term and\nlong-term temporal patterns by analyzing data across different scales. My\nempirical results reveal that while TimeMixer performs exceptionally well in\nshort-term volatility forecasting, its accuracy diminishes for longer-term\npredictions, particularly in highly volatile markets. These findings highlight\nTimeMixer's strength in capturing short-term volatility, making it highly\nsuitable for practical applications in financial risk management, where precise\nshort-term forecasts are critical. However, the model's limitations in\nlong-term forecasting point to potential areas for further refinement.", "published": "2024-09-27 17:35:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09062v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
