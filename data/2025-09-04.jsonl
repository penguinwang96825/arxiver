While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models.

In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other.

{"title": "ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection", "abstract": "The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an\nunderstanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate\nnegative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels\nsignificantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments.

{"title": "Why Language Models Hallucinate", "abstract": "Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes\nguess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of\nadmitting uncertainty. Such \"hallucinations\" persist even in state-of-the-art\nsystems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because\nthe training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging\nuncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the\nmodern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they\noriginate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements\ncannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language\nmodels will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that\nhallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language\nmodels are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain\nimproves test performance. This \"epidemic\" of penalizing uncertain responses\ncan only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the\nscoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,\nrather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations.

{"title": "Flexible inference of learning rules from de novo learning data using neural networks", "abstract": "Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with\ngrowing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial\nintelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric\nforms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited\nto simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new\ninput-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new\nbehaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We\ntarget this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal\ndecision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires\nmodels flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich\nexternal stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first\npropose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of\npolicy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering\nground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)\nthat captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial\nhistory. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory\ndecision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on\nheld-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct\nversus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian\nlearning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring\nbiological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,\nproviding insights to inform experimental training protocols and the\ndevelopment of behavioral digital twins.", "published": "2025-09-04 21:20:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04661v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

While conformal prediction offers\nfinite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly\nextend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,\nBayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong\ndistributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends\nsplit conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We\nfirst establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space\nusing a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees\nare lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as\nthe discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we\ndecompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and\nmisspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based\ncorrection to transfer calibration across resolutions.
