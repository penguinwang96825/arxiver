{"title": "Sentiment/Subjectivity Analysis Survey for Languages other than English", "abstract": "Subjective and sentiment analysis have gained considerable attention\nrecently. Most of the resources and systems built so far are done for English.\nThe need for designing systems for other languages is increasing. This paper\nsurveys different ways used for building systems for subjective and sentiment\nanalysis for languages other than English. There are three different types of\nsystems used for building these systems. The first (and the best) one is the\nlanguage specific systems. The second type of systems involves reusing or\ntransferring sentiment resources from English to the target language. The third\ntype of methods is based on using language independent methods. The paper\npresents a separate section devoted to Arabic sentiment analysis.", "published": "2016-01-01 15:42:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00087v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
