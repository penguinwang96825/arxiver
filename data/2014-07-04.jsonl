{"title": "Recognition of Isolated Words using Zernike and MFCC features for Audio\n  Visual Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by machine is an attractive research topic\nin signal processing domain and has attracted many researchers to contribute in\nthis area. In recent year, there have been many advances in automatic speech\nreading system with the inclusion of audio and visual speech features to\nrecognize words under noisy conditions. The objective of audio-visual speech\nrecognition system is to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we\ncomputed visual features using Zernike moments and audio feature using Mel\nFrequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) on vVISWa (Visual Vocabulary of\nIndependent Standard Words) dataset which contains collection of isolated set\nof city names of 10 speakers. The visual features were normalized and dimension\nof features set was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to\nrecognize the isolated word utterance on PCA space.The performance of\nrecognition of isolated words based on visual only and audio only features\nresults in 63.88 and 100 respectively.", "published": "2014-07-04 09:32:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1165v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
