{"title": "A Semantic Approach to Summarization", "abstract": "Sentence extraction based summarization methods has some limitations as it\ndoesn't go into the semantics of the document. Also, it lacks the capability of\nsentence generation which is intuitive to humans. Here we present a novel\nmethod to summarize text documents taking the process to semantic levels with\nthe use of WordNet and other resources, and using a technique for sentence\ngeneration. We involve semantic role labeling to get the semantic\nrepresentation of text and use of segmentation to form clusters of the related\npieces of text. Picking out the centroids and sentence generation completes the\ntask. We evaluate our system against human composed summaries and also present\nan evaluation done by humans to measure the quality attributes of our\nsummaries.", "published": "2014-06-04 20:22:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1203v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Best Templates Match Technique For Example Based Machine Translation", "abstract": "It has been proved that large scale realistic Knowledge Based Machine\nTranslation applications require acquisition of huge knowledge about language\nand about the world. This knowledge is encoded in computational grammars,\nlexicons and domain models. Another approach which avoids the need for\ncollecting and analyzing massive knowledge, is the Example Based approach,\nwhich is the topic of this paper. We show through the paper that using Example\nBased in its native form is not suitable for translating into Arabic. Therefore\na modification to the basic approach is presented to improve the accuracy of\nthe translation process. The basic idea of the new approach is to improve the\ntechnique by which template-based approaches select the appropriate templates.", "published": "2014-06-04 23:56:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1241v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Identifying Duplicate and Contradictory Information in Wikipedia", "abstract": "Our study identifies sentences in Wikipedia articles that are either\nidentical or highly similar by applying techniques for near-duplicate detection\nof web pages. This is accomplished with a MapReduce implementation of minhash\nto identify clusters of sentences with high Jaccard similarity. We show that\nthese clusters can be categorized into six different types, two of which are\nparticularly interesting: identical sentences quantify the extent to which\ncontent in Wikipedia is copied and pasted, and near-duplicate sentences that\nstate contradictory facts point to quality issues in Wikipedia.", "published": "2014-06-04 18:59:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1143v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.DL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A Geometric Method to Obtain the Generation Probability of a Sentence", "abstract": "\"How to generate a sentence\" is the most critical and difficult problem in\nall the natural language processing technologies. In this paper, we present a\nnew approach to explain the generation process of a sentence from the\nperspective of mathematics. Our method is based on the premise that in our\nbrain a sentence is a part of a word network which is formed by many word\nnodes. Experiments show that the probability of the entire sentence can be\nobtained by the probabilities of single words and the probabilities of the\nco-occurrence of word pairs, which indicate that human use the synthesis method\nto generate a sentence.", "published": "2014-06-04 23:28:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1234v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "math.ST", "stat.CO", "stat.ME", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
