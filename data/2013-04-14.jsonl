{"title": "Automatic case acquisition from texts for process-oriented case-based\n  reasoning", "abstract": "This paper introduces a method for the automatic acquisition of a rich case\nrepresentation from free text for process-oriented case-based reasoning. Case\nengineering is among the most complicated and costly tasks in implementing a\ncase-based reasoning system. This is especially so for process-oriented\ncase-based reasoning, where more expressive case representations are generally\nused and, in our opinion, actually required for satisfactory case adaptation.\nIn this context, the ability to acquire cases automatically from procedural\ntexts is a major step forward in order to reason on processes. We therefore\ndetail a methodology that makes case acquisition from processes described as\nfree text possible, with special attention given to assembly instruction texts.\nThis methodology extends the techniques we used to extract actions from cooking\nrecipes. We argue that techniques taken from natural language processing are\nrequired for this task, and that they give satisfactory results. An evaluation\nbased on our implemented prototype extracting workflows from recipe texts is\nprovided.", "published": "2013-04-14 05:52:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3879v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
