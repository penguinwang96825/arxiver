{"title": "Two are Better than One: An Ensemble of Retrieval- and Generation-Based\n  Dialog Systems", "abstract": "Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the\nfield of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog\nsystems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches,\nwhich can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and\ngeneration-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance\n(called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the\nquery. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of\ngenerating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel\nensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open\ndomain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original\nquery, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is\naware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new\ncandidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble\noutperforms each single part of it by a large margin.", "published": "2016-10-23 11:22:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07149v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
