{"title": "On Induced Online Ramsey Number of Paths, Cycles, and Trees", "abstract": "An online Ramsey game is a game between Builder and Painter, alternating in turns. They are given a graph $H$ and a graph $G$ of an infinite set of independent vertices. In each round Builder draws an edge and Painter colors it either red or blue. Builder wins if after some finite round there is a monochromatic copy of the graph $H$, otherwise Painter wins. The online Ramsey number $\\widetilde{r}(H)$ is the minimum number of rounds such that Builder can force a monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$. This is an analogy to the size-Ramsey number $\\overline{r}(H)$ defined as the minimum number such that there exists graph $G$ with $\\overline{r}(H)$ edges where for any edge two-coloring $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$.\n  In this paper, we introduce the concept of induced online Ramsey numbers: the induced online Ramsey number $\\widetilde{r}_{ind}(H)$ is the minimum number of rounds Builder can force an induced monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$. We prove asymptotically tight bounds on the induced online Ramsey numbers of paths, cycles and two families of trees. Moreover, we provide a result analogous to Conlon [On-line Ramsey Numbers, SIAM J. Discr. Math. 2009], showing that there is an infinite family of trees $T_1,T_2,\\dots$, $|T_i|<|T_{i+1}|$ for $i\\ge1$, such that \\[\n  \\lim_{i\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\widetilde{r}(T_i)}{\\overline{r}(T_i)} = 0. \\]", "published": "2019-01-11 17:47:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03671v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
