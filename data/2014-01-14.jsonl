{"title": "Learning Language from a Large (Unannotated) Corpus", "abstract": "A novel approach to the fully automated, unsupervised extraction of\ndependency grammars and associated syntax-to-semantic-relationship mappings\nfrom large text corpora is described. The suggested approach builds on the\nauthors' prior work with the Link Grammar, RelEx and OpenCog systems, as well\nas on a number of prior papers and approaches from the statistical language\nlearning literature. If successful, this approach would enable the mining of\nall the information needed to power a natural language comprehension and\ngeneration system, directly from a large, unannotated corpus.", "published": "2014-01-14 22:10:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3372v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "I.2.6; I.2.0; I.2.7; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
