{"title": "Large (and Deep) Factor Models", "abstract": "We open up the black box behind Deep Learning for portfolio optimization and prove that a sufficiently wide and arbitrarily deep neural network (DNN) trained to maximize the Sharpe ratio of the Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) is equivalent to a large factor model (LFM): A linear factor pricing model that uses many non-linear characteristics. The nature of these characteristics depends on the architecture of the DNN in an explicit, tractable fashion. This makes it possible to derive end-to-end trained DNN-based SDFs in closed form for the first time. We evaluate LFMs empirically and show how various architectural choices impact SDF performance. We document the virtue of depth complexity: With enough data, the out-of-sample performance of DNN-SDF is increasing in the NN depth, saturating at huge depths of around 100 hidden layers.", "published": "2024-01-20 14:03:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06635v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.CE", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
