{"title": "Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis of Categorical and Continuous\n  Time Series: an R package", "abstract": "This paper describes the R package crqa to perform cross-recurrence\nquantification analysis of two time series of either a categorical or\ncontinuous nature. Streams of behavioral information, from eye movements to\nlinguistic elements, unfold over time. When two people interact, such as in\nconversation, they often adapt to each other, leading these behavioral levels\nto exhibit recurrent states. In dialogue, for example, interlocutors adapt to\neach other by exchanging interactive cues: smiles, nods, gestures, choice of\nwords, and so on. In order for us to capture closely the goings-on of dynamic\ninteraction, and uncover the extent of coupling between two individuals, we\nneed to quantify how much recurrence is taking place at these levels. Methods\navailable in crqa would allow researchers in cognitive science to pose such\nquestions as how much are two people recurrent at some level of analysis, what\nis the characteristic lag time for one person to maximally match another, or\nwhether one person is leading another. First, we set the theoretical ground to\nunderstand the difference between 'correlation' and 'co-visitation' when\ncomparing two time series, using an aggregative or cross-recurrence approach.\nThen, we describe more formally the principles of cross-recurrence, and show\nwith the current package how to carry out analyses applying them. We end the\npaper by comparing computational efficiency, and results' consistency, of crqa\nR package, with the benchmark MATLAB toolbox crptoolbox. We show perfect\ncomparability between the two libraries on both levels.", "published": "2013-10-01 09:20:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0201v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
