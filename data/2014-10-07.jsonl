{"title": "Annotation as a New Paradigm in Research Archiving", "abstract": "We outline a paradigm to preserve results of digital scholarship, whether\nthey are query results, feature values, or topic assignments. This paradigm is\ncharacterized by using annotations as multifunctional carriers and making them\nportable. The testing grounds we have chosen are two significant enterprises,\none in the history of science, and one in Hebrew scholarship. The first one\n(CKCC) focuses on the results of a project where a Dutch consortium of\nuniversities, research institutes, and cultural heritage institutions\nexperimented for 4 years with language techniques and topic modeling methods\nwith the aim to analyze the emergence of scholarly debates. The data: a complex\nset of about 20.000 letters. The second one (DTHB) is a multi-year effort to\nexpress the linguistic features of the Hebrew bible in a text database, which\nis still growing in detail and sophistication. Versions of this database are\npackaged in commercial bible study software. We state that the results of these\nforms of scholarship require new knowledge management and archive practices.\nOnly when researchers can build efficiently on each other's (intermediate)\nresults, they can achieve the aggregations of quality data by which new\nquestions can be answered, and hidden patterns visualized. Archives are\nrequired to find a balance between preserving authoritative versions of sources\nand supporting collaborative efforts in digital scholarship. Annotations are\npromising vehicles for preserving and reusing research results.
