{"title": "Learning to Exploit Different Translation Resources for Cross Language\n  Information Retrieval", "abstract": "One of the important factors that affects the performance of Cross Language\nInformation Retrieval(CLIR)is the quality of translations being employed in\nCLIR. In order to improve the quality of translations, it is important to\nexploit available resources efficiently. Employing different translation\nresources with different characteristics has many challenges. In this paper, we\npropose a method for exploiting available translation resources simultaneously.\nThis method employs Learning to Rank(LTR) for exploiting different translation\nresources. To apply LTR methods for query translation, we define different\ntranslation relation based features in addition to context based features. We\nuse the contextual information contained in translation resources for\nextracting context based features.The proposed method uses LTR to construct a\ntranslation ranking model based on defined features. The constructed model is\nused for ranking translation candidates of query words. To evaluate the\nproposed method we do English-Persian CLIR, in which we employ the translation\nranking model to find translations of English queries and employ the\ntranslations to retrieve Persian documents. Experimental results show that our\napproach significantly outperforms single resource based CLIR methods.", "published": "2014-05-20 11:45:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5447v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
