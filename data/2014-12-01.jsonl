{"title": "Effective Use of Word Order for Text Categorization with Convolutional\n  Neural Networks", "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network that can make use of\nthe internal structure of data such as the 2D structure of image data. This\npaper studies CNN on text categorization to exploit the 1D structure (namely,\nword order) of text data for accurate prediction. Instead of using\nlow-dimensional word vectors as input as is often done, we directly apply CNN\nto high-dimensional text data, which leads to directly learning embedding of\nsmall text regions for use in classification. In addition to a straightforward\nadaptation of CNN from image to text, a simple but new variation which employs\nbag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer is proposed. An extension to\ncombine multiple convolution layers is also explored for higher accuracy. The\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "published": "2014-12-01 16:19:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1058v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Understanding confounding effects in linguistic coordination: an\n  information-theoretic approach", "abstract": "We suggest an information-theoretic approach for measuring stylistic\ncoordination in dialogues. The proposed measure has a simple predictive\ninterpretation and can account for various confounding factors through proper\nconditioning. We revisit some of the previous studies that reported strong\nsignatures of stylistic accommodation, and find that a significant part of the\nobserved coordination can be attributed to a simple confounding effect - length\ncoordination. Specifically, longer utterances tend to be followed by longer\nresponses, which gives rise to spurious correlations in the other stylistic\nfeatures. We propose a test to distinguish correlations in length due to\ncontextual factors (topic of conversation, user verbosity, etc.) and\nturn-by-turn coordination. We also suggest a test to identify whether stylistic\ncoordination persists even after accounting for length coordination and\ncontextual factors.", "published": "2014-12-01 21:27:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0696v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "cs.SI", "math.IT", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
