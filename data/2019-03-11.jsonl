{"title": "Bridging the Gap Between Monaural Speech Enhancement and Recognition with Distortion-Independent Acoustic Modeling", "abstract": "Monaural speech enhancement has made dramatic advances since the introduction of deep learning a few years ago. Although enhanced speech has been demonstrated to have better intelligibility and quality for human listeners, feeding it directly to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems trained with noisy speech has not produced expected improvements in ASR performance. The lack of an enhancement benefit on recognition, or the gap between monaural speech enhancement and recognition, is often attributed to speech distortions introduced in the enhancement process. In this study, we analyze the distortion problem, compare different acoustic models, and investigate a distortion-independent training scheme for monaural speech recognition. Experimental results suggest that distortion-independent acoustic modeling is able to overcome the distortion problem. Such an acoustic model can also work with speech enhancement models different from the one used during training. Moreover, the models investigated in this paper outperform the previous best system on the CHiME-2 corpus.", "published": "2019-03-11 19:51:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04567v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Scaling in Words on Twitter", "abstract": "Scaling properties of language are a useful tool for understanding generative processes in texts. We investigate the scaling relations in citywise Twitter corpora coming from the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas of the United States. We observe a slightly superlinear urban scaling with the city population for the total volume of the tweets and words created in a city. We then find that a certain core vocabulary follows the scaling relationship of that of the bulk text, but most words are sensitive to city size, exhibiting a super- or a sublinear urban scaling. For both regimes we can offer a plausible explanation based on the meaning of the words. We also show that the parameters for Zipf's law and Heaps law differ on Twitter from that of other texts, and that the exponent of Zipf's law changes with city size.", "published": "2019-03-11 14:41:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04329v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
{"title": "Redditors in Recovery: Text Mining Reddit to Investigate Transitions into Drug Addiction", "abstract": "Increasing rates of opioid drug abuse and heightened prevalence of online support communities underscore the necessity of employing data mining techniques to better understand drug addiction using these rapidly developing online resources. In this work, we obtain data from Reddit, an online collection of forums, to gather insight into drug use/misuse using text data from users themselves. Specifically, using user posts, we trained 1) a binary classifier which predicts transitions from casual drug discussion forums to drug recovery forums and 2) a Cox regression model that outputs likelihoods of such transitions. In doing so, we found that utterances of select drugs and certain linguistic features contained in one's posts can help predict these transitions. Using unfiltered drug-related posts, our research delineates drugs that are associated with higher rates of transitions from recreational drug discussion to support/recovery discussion, offers insight into modern drug culture, and provides tools with potential applications in combating the opioid crisis.", "published": "2019-03-11 00:10:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04081v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Optimal Entry and Consumption under Habit Formation", "abstract": "This paper studies a composite problem involving the decision making of the optimal entry time and dynamic consumption afterwards. In stage-1, the investor has access to full market information subjecting to some information costs and needs to choose an optimal stopping time to initiate stage-2; in stage-2, the investor terminates the costly full information acquisition and starts dynamic investment and consumption under partial observations of free public stock prices. The habit formation preference is employed, in which the past consumption affects the investor's current decisions. By using the stochastic Perron's method, the value function of the composite problem is proved to be the unique viscosity solution of some variational inequalities.", "published": "2019-03-11 12:48:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04257v6", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
