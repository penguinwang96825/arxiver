{"title": "Prosody: The Rhythms and Melodies of Speech", "abstract": "The present contribution is a tutorial on selected aspects of prosody, the\nrhythms and melodies of speech, based on a course of the same name at the\nSummer School on Contemporary Phonetics and Phonology at Tongji University,\nShanghai, China in July 2016. The tutorial is not intended as an introduction\nto experimental methodology or as an overview of the literature on the topic,\nbut as an outline of observationally accessible aspects of fundamental\nfrequency and timing patterns with the aid of computational visualisation,\nsituated in a semiotic framework of sign ranks and interpretations. After an\ninformal introduction to the basic concepts of prosody in the introduction and\na discussion of the place of prosody in the architecture of language, a\nselection of acoustic phonetic topics in phonemic tone and accent prosody, word\nprosody, phrasal prosody and discourse prosody are discussed, and a stylisation\nmethod for visualising aspects of prosody is introduced. Examples are taken\nfrom a number of typologically different languages: Anyi/Agni (Niger-Congo>Kwa,\nIvory Coast), English, Kuki-Thadou (Sino-Tibetan, North-East India and\nMyanmar), Mandarin Chinese, Tem (Niger-Congo>Gur, Togo) and Farsi. The main\nfocus is on fundamental frequency patterns, but issues of timing and rhythm are\nalso discussed. In the final section, further reading and possible future\nresearch directions are outlined.", "published": "2017-04-09 06:17:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02565v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
