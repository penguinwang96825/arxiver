{"title": "Egyptian Dialect Stopword List Generation from Social Network Data", "abstract": "This paper proposes a methodology for generating a stopword list from online\nsocial network (OSN) corpora in Egyptian Dialect(ED). The aim of the paper is\nto investigate the effect of removingED stopwords on the Sentiment Analysis\n(SA) task. The stopwords lists generated before were on Modern Standard Arabic\n(MSA) which is not the common language used in OSN. We have generated a\nstopword list of Egyptian dialect to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare\nthe efficiency of text classification when using the generated list along with\npreviously generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with\nthe MSA list. The text classification was performed using Na\\\"ive Bayes and\nDecision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigram and\nbigram. The experiments show that removing ED stopwords give better performance\nthan using lists of MSA stopwords only.", "published": "2015-04-13 15:56:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02060v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Review Mining for Feature Based Opinion Summarization and Visualization", "abstract": "The application and usage of opinion mining, especially for business\nintelligence, product recommendation, targeted marketing etc. have fascinated\nmany research attentions around the globe. Various research efforts attempted\nto mine opinions from customer reviews at different levels of granularity,\nincluding word-, sentence-, and document-level. However, development of a fully\nautomatic opinion mining and sentiment analysis system is still elusive. Though\nthe development of opinion mining and sentiment analysis systems are getting\nmomentum, most of them attempt to perform document-level sentiment analysis,\nclassifying a review document as positive, negative, or neutral. Such\ndocument-level opinion mining approaches fail to provide insight about users\nsentiment on individual features of a product or service. Therefore, it seems\nto be a great help for both customers and manufacturers, if the reviews could\nbe processed at a finer-grained level and presented in a summarized form\nthrough some visual means, highlighting individual features of a product and\nusers sentiment expressed over them. In this paper, the design of a unified\nopinion mining and sentiment analysis framework is presented at the\nintersection of both machine learning and natural language processing\napproaches. Also, design of a novel feature-level review summarization scheme\nis proposed to visualize mined features, opinions and their polarity values in\na comprehendible way.", "published": "2015-04-13 05:53:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03068v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
