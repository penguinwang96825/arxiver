{"title": "Inlining External Sources in Answer Set Programs", "abstract": "HEX-programs are an extension of answer set programs (ASP) with external sources. To this end, external atoms provide a bidirectional interface between the program and an external source. The traditional evaluation algorithm for HEX-programs is based on guessing truth values of external atoms and verifying them by explicit calls of the external source. The approach was optimized by techniques that reduce the number of necessary verification calls or speed them up, but the remaining external calls are still expensive. In this paper we present an alternative evaluation approach based on inlining of external atoms, motivated by existing but less general approaches for specialized formalisms such as DL-programs. External atoms are then compiled away such that no verification calls are necessary. The approach is implemented in the dlvhex reasoner. Experiments show a significant performance gain. Besides performance improvements, we further exploit inlining for extending previous (semantic) characterizations of program equivalence from ASP to HEX-programs, including those of strong equivalence, uniform equivalence and H, B -equivalence. Finally, based on these equivalence criteria, we characterize also inconsistency of programs wrt. extensions. Since well-known ASP extensions (such as constraint ASP) are special cases of HEX, the results are interesting beyond the particular formalism.

{"title": "Semi-blind source separation with multichannel variational autoencoder", "abstract": "This paper proposes a multichannel source separation technique called the multichannel variational autoencoder (MVAE) method, which uses a conditional VAE (CVAE) to model and estimate the power spectrograms of the sources in a mixture. By training the CVAE using the spectrograms of training examples with source-class labels, we can use the trained decoder distribution as a universal generative model capable of generating spectrograms conditioned on a specified class label. By treating the latent space variables and the class label as the unknown parameters of this generative model, we can develop a convergence-guaranteed semi-blind source separation algorithm that consists of iteratively estimating the power spectrograms of the underlying sources as well as the separation matrices. In experimental evaluations, our MVAE produced better separation performance than a baseline method.", "published": "2018-08-02 16:30:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00892v3", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Mobile Positioning in Multipath Environments: a Pseudo Maximum Likelihood approach", "abstract": "The problem of mobile position estimation in multipath scenarios is addressed. A low-complexity, fully-adaptive algorithm is proposed, based on the pseudo maximum likelihood approach. The processing is done exclusively on-board at the mobile node by exploiting narrowband downlink radio signals. The proposed algorithm is able to estimate via adaptive beamforming (with spatial smoothing) the optimal projection matrices that maximize the likelihood; in addition, it can associate the line-of-sight over the trajectory, hence achieving an integration gain. The performance assessment shows that the proposed algorithm is very effective in (even severe) multipath conditions, outperforming natural competitors also when the number of antennas and snapshots is kept at the theoretical minimum.", "published": "2018-08-02 15:30:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00857v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
