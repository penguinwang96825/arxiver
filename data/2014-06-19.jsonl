{"title": "Zipf's law holds for phrases, not words", "abstract": "With Zipf's law being originally and most famously observed for word\nfrequency, it is surprisingly limited in its applicability to human language,\nholding over no more than three to four orders of magnitude before hitting a\nclear break in scaling. Here, building on the simple observation that phrases\nof one or more words comprise the most coherent units of meaning in language,\nwe show empirically that Zipf's law for phrases extends over as many as nine\norders of rank magnitude. In doing so, we develop a principled and scalable\nstatistical mechanical method of random text partitioning, which opens up a\nrich frontier of rigorous text analysis via a rank ordering of mixed length\nphrases.", "published": "2014-06-19 20:00:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5181v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
