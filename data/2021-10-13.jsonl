{"title": "Towards a fully RL-based Market Simulator", "abstract": "We present a new financial framework where two families of RL-based agents representing the Liquidity Providers and Liquidity Takers learn simultaneously to satisfy their objective. Thanks to a parametrized reward formulation and the use of Deep RL, each group learns a shared policy able to generalize and interpolate over a wide range of behaviors. This is a step towards a fully RL-based market simulator replicating complex market conditions particularly suited to study the dynamics of the financial market under various scenarios.", "published": "2021-10-13 16:14:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06829v2", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
