{"title": "Probabilistic Cascading for Large Scale Hierarchical Classification", "abstract": "Hierarchies are frequently used for the organization of objects. Given a\nhierarchy of classes, two main approaches are used, to automatically classify\nnew instances: flat classification and cascade classification. Flat\nclassification ignores the hierarchy, while cascade classification greedily\ntraverses the hierarchy from the root to the predicted leaf. In this paper we\npropose a new approach, which extends cascade classification to predict the\nright leaf by estimating the probability of each root-to-leaf path. We provide\nexperimental results which indicate that, using the same classification\nalgorithm, one can achieve better results with our approach, compared to the\ntraditional flat and cascade classifications.", "published": "2015-05-09 09:39:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02251v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
