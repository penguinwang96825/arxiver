{"title": "Automatic Taxonomy Extraction from Query Logs with no Additional Sources\n  of Information", "abstract": "Search engine logs store detailed information on Web users interactions.\nThus, as more and more people use search engines on a daily basis, important\ntrails of users common knowledge are being recorded in those files. Previous\nresearch has shown that it is possible to extract concept taxonomies from full\ntext documents, while other scholars have proposed methods to obtain similar\nqueries from query logs. We propose a mixture of both lines of research, that\nis, mining query logs not to find related queries nor query hierarchies, but\nactual term taxonomies that could be used to improve search engine\neffectiveness and efficiency. As a result, in this study we have developed a\nmethod that combines lexical heuristics with a supervised classification model\nto successfully extract hyponymy relations from specialization search patterns\nrevealed from log missions, with no additional sources of information, and in a\nlanguage independent way.", "published": "2015-10-02 15:02:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00618v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing", "abstract": "Over the past few years, neural networks have re-emerged as powerful\nmachine-learning models, yielding state-of-the-art results in fields such as\nimage recognition and speech processing. More recently, neural network models\nstarted to be applied also to textual natural language signals, again with very\npromising results. This tutorial surveys neural network models from the\nperspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring\nnatural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques. The\ntutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward\nnetworks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as\nwell as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation.", "published": "2015-10-02 20:17:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00726v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
