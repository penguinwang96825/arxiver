{"title": "The Incidence Chromatic Number of Toroidal Grids", "abstract": "An incidence in a graph $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$ with $v \\in V(G)$ and $e \\in E(G)$, such that $v$ and $e$ are incident. Two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(w,f)$ are adjacent if $v=w$, or $e=f$, or the edge $vw$ equals $e$ or $f$. The incidence chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest $k$ for which there exists a mapping from the set of incidences of $G$ to a set of $k$ colors that assigns distinct colors to adjacent incidences. In this paper, we prove that the incidence chromatic number of the toroidal grid $T_{m,n}=C_m\\Box C_n$ equals 5 when $m,n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$ and 6 otherwise.", "published": "2009-07-22 09:08:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3801v3", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
