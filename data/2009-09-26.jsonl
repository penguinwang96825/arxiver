{"title": "Super-wavelets versus poly-Bergman spaces", "abstract": "Motivated by potential applications in multiplexing and by recent results on Gabor analysis with Hermite windows due to Gr\u00f6chenig and Lyubarskii, we investigate vector-valued wavelet transforms and vector-valued wavelet frames, which constitute special cases of super-wavelets, with a particular attention to the case when the analyzing wavelet vector is related to Fourier transforms of Laguerre functions. We construct an isometric isomorphism between $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{+},\\mathbf{C}^{n})$ and poly-Bergman spaces, with a view to relate the sampling sequences in the poly-Bergman spaces to the wavelet frames and super-frames with the windows $\u03a6_{n}$. One of the applications of the theory is a proof that $b\\ln a<2\u03c0(n+1)$ is a necessary condition for the (scalar) wavelet frame associated to the $\u03a6_{n}$ to exist. This seems to be the first known result of this type outside the setting of analytic functions (the case $n=0$, which has been completely studied by Seip in 1993).", "published": "2009-09-26 03:46:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4830v1", "categories": ["math.FA", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "math.FA"}
