{"title": "Clustering is Efficient for Approximate Maximum Inner Product Search", "abstract": "Efficient Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task that has a\nwide applicability in recommendation systems and classification with a large\nnumber of classes. Solutions based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) as well\nas tree-based solutions have been investigated in the recent literature, to\nperform approximate MIPS in sublinear time. In this paper, we compare these to\nanother extremely simple approach for solving approximate MIPS, based on\nvariants of the k-means clustering algorithm. Specifically, we propose to train\na spherical k-means, after having reduced the MIPS problem to a Maximum Cosine\nSimilarity Search (MCSS). Experiments on two standard recommendation system\nbenchmarks as well as on large vocabulary word embeddings, show that this\nsimple approach yields much higher speedups, for the same retrieval precision,\nthan current state-of-the-art hashing-based and tree-based methods. This simple\nmethod also yields more robust retrievals when the query is corrupted by noise.", "published": "2015-07-21 16:53:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05910v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
