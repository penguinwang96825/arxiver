{"title": "From Disequilibrium Markets to Equilibrium", "abstract": "The modeling of financial markets as disequilibrium models by ordinary differential equations has become a popular modeling tool. One famous example of such a model is the Beja-Goldman model(The Journal of Finance, 1980) which we consider in this paper. We study the passage from disequilibrium dynamics to equilibrium. Mathematically, this limit corresponds to an asymptotic limit also known as a Tikhonov-Fenichel reduction. Furthermore, we analyze the stability of the reduced equilibrium model and discuss the economic implications. We conduct several numerical examples to visualize and support our analysis.", "published": "2019-12-20 07:56:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09679v1", "categories": ["econ.GN", "math.DS", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "econ.GN"}
