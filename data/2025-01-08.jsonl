{"title": "FinSphere: A Conversational Stock Analysis Agent Equipped with Quantitative Tools based on Real-Time Database", "abstract": "Current financial Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with two critical\nlimitations: a lack of depth in stock analysis, which impedes their ability to\ngenerate professional-grade insights, and the absence of objective evaluation\nmetrics to assess the quality of stock analysis reports. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces FinSphere, a conversational stock analysis\nagent, along with three major contributions: (1) Stocksis, a dataset curated by\nindustry experts to enhance LLMs' stock analysis capabilities, (2) AnalyScore,\na systematic evaluation framework for assessing stock analysis quality, and (3)\nFinSphere, an AI agent that can generate high-quality stock analysis reports in\nresponse to user queries. Experiments demonstrate that FinSphere achieves\nsuperior performance compared to both general and domain-specific LLMs, as well\nas existing agent-based systems, even when they are enhanced with real-time\ndata access and few-shot guidance. The integrated framework, which combines\nreal-time data feeds, quantitative tools, and an instruction-tuned LLM, yields\nsubstantial improvements in both analytical quality and practical applicability\nfor real-world stock analysis.", "published": "2025-01-08 07:50:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12399v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
