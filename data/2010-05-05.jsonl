{"title": "Watching Systems in graphs: an extension of Identifying Codes", "abstract": "We introduce the notion of watching systems in graphs, which is a generalization of that of identifying codes. We give some basic properties of watching systems, an upper bound on the minimum size of a watching system, and results on the graphs which achieve this bound; we also study the cases of the paths and cycles, and give complexity results.", "published": "2010-05-05 14:39:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0765v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
