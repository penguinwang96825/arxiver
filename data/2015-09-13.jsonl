{"title": "The USFD Spoken Language Translation System for IWSLT 2014", "abstract": "The University of Sheffield (USFD) participated in the International Workshop\nfor Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) in 2014. In this paper, we will\nintroduce the USFD SLT system for IWSLT. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is\nachieved by two multi-pass deep neural network systems with adaptation and\nrescoring techniques. Machine translation (MT) is achieved by a phrase-based\nsystem. The USFD primary system incorporates state-of-the-art ASR and MT\ntechniques and gives a BLEU score of 23.45 and 14.75 on the English-to-French\nand English-to-German speech-to-text translation task with the IWSLT 2014 data.\nThe USFD contrastive systems explore the integration of ASR and MT by using a\nquality estimation system to rescore the ASR outputs, optimising towards better\ntranslation. This gives a further 0.54 and 0.26 BLEU improvement respectively\non the IWSLT 2012 and 2014 evaluation data.", "published": "2015-09-13 16:58:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03870v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
