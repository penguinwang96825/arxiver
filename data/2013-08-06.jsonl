{"title": "Science Fiction as a Worldwide Phenomenon: A Study of International\n  Creation, Consumption and Dissemination", "abstract": "This paper examines the international nature of science fiction. The focus of\nthis research is to determine whether science fiction is primarily English\nspeaking and Western or global; being created and consumed by people in\nnon-Western, non-English speaking countries? Science fiction's international\npresence was found in three ways, by network analysis, by examining a online\nretailer and with a survey. Condor, a program developed by GalaxyAdvisors was\nused to determine if science fiction is being talked about by non-English\nspeakers. An analysis of the international Amazon.com websites was done to\ndiscover if it was being consumed worldwide. A survey was also conducted to see\nif people had experience with science fiction. All three research methods\nrevealed similar results. Science fiction was found to be international, with\nscience fiction creators originating in different countries and writing in a\nhost of different languages. English and non-English science fiction was being\ncreated and consumed all over the world, not just in the English speaking West.", "published": "2013-08-06 14:58:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1292v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
