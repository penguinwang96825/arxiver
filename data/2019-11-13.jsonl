{"title": "Neural networks for option pricing and hedging: a literature review", "abstract": "Neural networks have been used as a nonparametric method for option pricing and hedging since the early 1990s. Far over a hundred papers have been published on this topic. This note intends to provide a comprehensive review. Papers are compared in terms of input features, output variables, benchmark models, performance measures, data partition methods, and underlying assets. Furthermore, related work and regularisation techniques are discussed.", "published": "2019-11-13 17:01:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05620v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.ST", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Quantization-based Bermudan option pricing in the $FX$ world", "abstract": "This paper proposes two numerical solution based on Product Optimal Quantization for the pricing of Foreign Echange (FX) linked long term Bermudan options e.g. Bermudan Power Reverse Dual Currency options, where we take into account stochastic domestic and foreign interest rates on top of stochastic FX rate, hence we consider a 3-factor model. For these two numerical methods, we give an estimation of the $L^2$-error induced by such approximations and we illustrate them with market-based examples that highlight the speed of such methods.", "published": "2019-11-13 13:56:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05462v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
