{"title": "UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models", "abstract": "This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark,\nan innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language\nmodels (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark\nadopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic,\ntask-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial\nscenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants,\ncollecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback,\nwe created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and\ninteractions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 11 LLMs\nservices using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant\nalignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE\ndataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the\npotential of LLMs in the financial domain but also provides a robust framework\nfor assessing their performance and user satisfaction.", "published": "2024-10-17 22:03:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14059v3", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Delegated portfolio management with random default", "abstract": "We are considering the problem of optimal portfolio delegation between an\ninvestor and a portfolio manager under a random default time. We focus on a\nnovel variation of the Principal-Agent problem adapted to this framework. We\naddress the challenge of an uncertain investment horizon caused by an exogenous\nrandom default time, after which neither the agent nor the principal can access\nthe market. This uncertainty introduces significant complexities in analyzing\nthe problem, requiring distinct mathematical approaches for two cases: when the\nrandom default time falls within the initial time frame [0,T] and when it\nextends beyond this period. We develop a theoretical framework to model the\nstochastic dynamics of the investment process, incorporating the random default\ntime. We then analyze the portfolio manager's investment decisions and\ncompensation mechanisms for both scenarios. In the first case, where the\ndefault time could be unbounded, we apply traditional results from Backward\nStochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) and control theory to address the\nagent problem. In the second case, where the default time is within the\ninterval [0,T], the problem becomes more intricate due to the degeneracy of the\nBSDE's driver. For both scenarios, we demonstrate that the contracting problem\ncan be resolved by examining the existence of solutions to integro-partial\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in both situations. We develop a\ndeep-learning algorithm to solve the problem in high-dimension with no access\nto the optimizer of the Hamiltonian function.", "published": "2024-10-17 00:27:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13103v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Competitive equilibria in trading", "abstract": "This is the third paper in a series concerning the game-theoretic aspects of\nposition-building while in competition. The first paper set forth foundations\nand laid out the essential goal, which is to minimize implementation costs in\nlight of how other traders are likely to trade. The majority of results in that\npaper center on the two traders in competition and equilibrium results are\npresented. The second paper, introduces computational methods based on Fourier\nSeries which allows the introduction of a broad range of constraints into the\noptimal strategies derived. The current paper returns to the unconstrained case\nand provides a complete solution to finding equilibrium strategies in\ncompetition and handles completely arbitrary situations. As a result we present\na detailed analysis of the value (or not) of trade centralization and we show\nthat firms who naively centralize trades do not generally benefit and\nsometimes, in fact, lose. On the other hand, firms that strategically\ncentralize their trades generally will be able to benefit.", "published": "2024-10-17 14:19:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13583v3", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Concentrated Superelliptical Market Maker", "abstract": "An automated market maker where the price can cross the zero bound into the\nnegative price domain with applications in electricity, energy, and derivatives\nmarkets is presented. A unique feature involves the ability to swap both\nnegatively and positively priced assets between one another, which unlike\ntraditional markets requires a numeraire in the form of a currency. Model\nextensions to skew and concentrate liquidity are shown. The liquidity\nfingerprint, payoff, and invariant are compared to the Black-Scholes covered\ncall and the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule invariants.", "published": "2024-10-17 06:39:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13265v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
