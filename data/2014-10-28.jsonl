{"title": "Correcting Errors in Digital Lexicographic Resources Using a Dictionary\n  Manipulation Language", "abstract": "We describe a paradigm for combining manual and automatic error correction of\nnoisy structured lexicographic data. Modifications to the structure and\nunderlying text of the lexicographic data are expressed in a simple,\ninterpreted programming language. Dictionary Manipulation Language (DML)\ncommands identify nodes by unique identifiers, and manipulations are performed\nusing simple commands such as create, move, set text, etc. Corrected lexicons\nare produced by applying sequences of DML commands to the source version of the\nlexicon. DML commands can be written manually to repair one-off errors or\ngenerated automatically to correct recurring problems. We discuss advantages of\nthe paradigm for the task of editing digital bilingual dictionaries.", "published": "2014-10-28 20:12:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7787v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
