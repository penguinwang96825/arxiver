{"title": "Interest rate derivatives in a CTMC setting: pricing, replication and Ross recovery", "abstract": "We consider a financial market in which the short rate is modeled by a\ncontinuous time Markov chain (CTMC) with a finite state space. In this setting,\nwe show how to price any financial derivative whose payoff is a function of the\nstate of the underlying CTMC at the maturity date. We also show how to\nreplicate such claims by trading only a money market account and zero-coupon\nbonds. Finally, using an extension of Ross' Recovery Theorem due to Qin and\nLinetsky, we deduce the real-world dynamics of the CTMC.", "published": "2024-09-21 16:47:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14193v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Price predictability in limit order book with deep learning model", "abstract": "This study explores the prediction of high-frequency price changes using deep\nlearning models. Although state-of-the-art methods perform well, their\ncomplexity impedes the understanding of successful predictions. We found that\nan inadequately defined target price process may render predictions meaningless\nby incorporating past information. The commonly used three-class problem in\nasset price prediction can generally be divided into volatility and directional\nprediction. When relying solely on the price process, directional prediction\nperformance is not substantial. However, volume imbalance improves directional\nprediction performance.", "published": "2024-09-21 14:40:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14157v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
