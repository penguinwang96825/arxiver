{"title": "StockTime: A Time Series Specialized Large Language Model Architecture for Stock Price Prediction", "abstract": "The stock price prediction task holds a significant role in the financial\ndomain and has been studied for a long time. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent\nfinancial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in\nfinancial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs),\nchallenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating\nthe modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these\ncapabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and\ninterpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series\ndata. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in\nfinancial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced\nwith such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based\narchitecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs,\nStockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It\nleverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating\nstock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as\nstock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock\nprices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the\nembedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts\nstock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions\nwhile reducing memory usage and runtime costs.", "published": "2024-08-25 00:50:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08281v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.CE", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
