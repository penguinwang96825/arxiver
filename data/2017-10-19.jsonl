{"title": "SLING: A framework for frame semantic parsing", "abstract": "We describe SLING, a framework for parsing natural language into semantic\nframes. SLING supports general transition-based, neural-network parsing with\nbidirectional LSTM input encoding and a Transition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU)\nfor output decoding. The parsing model is trained end-to-end using only the\ntext tokens as input. The transition system has been designed to output frame\ngraphs directly without any intervening symbolic representation. The SLING\nframework includes an efficient and scalable frame store implementation as well\nas a neural network JIT compiler for fast inference during parsing. SLING is\nimplemented in C++ and it is available for download on GitHub.", "published": "2017-10-19 08:13:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07032v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Unsupervised Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction of English and Dutch\n  Clinical Free-Text with Word and Character N-Gram Embeddings", "abstract": "We present an unsupervised context-sensitive spelling correction method for\nclinical free-text that uses word and character n-gram embeddings. Our method\ngenerates misspelling replacement candidates and ranks them according to their\nsemantic fit, by calculating a weighted cosine similarity between the\nvectorized representation of a candidate and the misspelling context. To tune\nthe parameters of this model, we generate self-induced spelling error corpora.\nWe perform our experiments for two languages. For English, we greatly\noutperform off-the-shelf spelling correction tools on a manually annotated\nMIMIC-III test set, and counter the frequency bias of a noisy channel model,\nshowing that neural embeddings can be successfully exploited to improve upon\nthe state-of-the-art. For Dutch, we also outperform an off-the-shelf spelling\ncorrection tool on manually annotated clinical records from the Antwerp\nUniversity Hospital, but can offer no empirical evidence that our method\ncounters the frequency bias of a noisy channel model in this case as well.\nHowever, both our context-sensitive model and our implementation of the noisy\nchannel model obtain high scores on the test set, establishing a\nstate-of-the-art for Dutch clinical spelling correction with the noisy channel\nmodel.", "published": "2017-10-19 09:15:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07045v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Findings of the Second Shared Task on Multimodal Machine Translation and\n  Multilingual Image Description", "abstract": "We present the results from the second shared task on multimodal machine\ntranslation and multilingual image description. Nine teams submitted 19 systems\nto two tasks. The multimodal translation task, in which the source sentence is\nsupplemented by an image, was extended with a new language (French) and two new\ntest sets. The multilingual image description task was changed such that at\ntest time, only the image is given.
