{"title": "A Comparative Predicting Stock Prices using Heston and Geometric Brownian Motion Models", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to predicting stock prices using technical analysis. By utilizing Ito's lemma and Euler-Maruyama methods, the researchers develop Heston and Geometric Brownian Motion models that take into account volatility, interest rate, and historical stock prices to generate predictions. The results of the study demonstrate that these models are effective in accurately predicting stock prices and outperform commonly used statistical indicators. The authors conclude that this technical analysis-based method offers a promising solution for stock market prediction.", "published": "2023-02-15 17:31:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07796v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "math.NA"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
