{"title": "The happiness paradox: your friends are happier than you", "abstract": "Most individuals in social networks experience a so-called Friendship\nParadox: they are less popular than their friends on average. This effect may\nexplain recent findings that widespread social network media use leads to\nreduced happiness. However the relation between popularity and happiness is\npoorly understood. A Friendship paradox does not necessarily imply a Happiness\nparadox where most individuals are less happy than their friends. Here we\nreport the first direct observation of a significant Happiness Paradox in a\nlarge-scale online social network of $39,110$ Twitter users. Our results reveal\nthat popular individuals are indeed happier and that a majority of individuals\nexperience a significant Happiness paradox. The magnitude of the latter effect\nis shaped by complex interactions between individual popularity, happiness, and\nthe fact that users cluster assortatively by level of happiness. Our results\nindicate that the topology of online social networks and the distribution of\nhappiness in some populations can cause widespread psycho-social effects that\naffect the well-being of billions of individuals.", "published": "2016-02-08 17:46:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02665v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.HC", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
