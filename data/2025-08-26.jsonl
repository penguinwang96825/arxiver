Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific\nqueries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose\nUniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems.

By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).", "published": "2025-08-26 16:04:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.MA", "cs.SC"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training.", "published": "2025-08-26 13:03:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19003v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs.

In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs\nsuggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand\nimages involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes.

To avoid penalizing valid\npredictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a\nmultiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only\nground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are\nconstructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when \"catching\" is annotated, \"throwing\"\nis not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions).

Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable\nfeedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be\ndescribed as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after\nconsuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen\nfrom the user's consumption history.

We\nrun MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse\nagent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding\nproposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First,\nagent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is\nbeing monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

{"title": "1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise", "abstract": "Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal\nacquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently\nconstrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a\ntrade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy\nconsumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit\ndepth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with\nlow-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with\nSigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,\nSDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to\nhandle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF)\naddresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware,\nresulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and\nUSF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise\nshaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited\nsignals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains.\n(2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery\nmethod for 1-Bit USF.
