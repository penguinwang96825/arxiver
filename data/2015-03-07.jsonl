{"title": "Identifying missing dictionary entries with frequency-conserving context\n  models", "abstract": "In an effort to better understand meaning from natural language texts, we\nexplore methods aimed at organizing lexical objects into contexts. A number of\nthese methods for organization fall into a family defined by word ordering.\nUnlike demographic or spatial partitions of data, these collocation models are\nof special importance for their universal applicability. While we are\ninterested here in text and have framed our treatment appropriately, our work\nis potentially applicable to other areas of research (e.g., speech, genomics,\nand mobility patterns) where one has ordered categorical data, (e.g., sounds,\ngenes, and locations). Our approach focuses on the phrase (whether word or\nlarger) as the primary meaning-bearing lexical unit and object of study. To do\nso, we employ our previously developed framework for generating word-conserving\nphrase-frequency data. Upon training our model with the Wiktionary---an\nextensive, online, collaborative, and open-source dictionary that contains over\n100,000 phrasal-definitions---we develop highly effective filters for the\nidentification of meaningful, missing phrase-entries. With our predictions we\nthen engage the editorial community of the Wiktionary and propose short lists\nof potential missing entries for definition, developing a breakthrough, lexical\nextraction technique, and expanding our knowledge of the defined English\nlexicon of phrases.", "published": "2015-03-07 02:45:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02120v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
