{"title": "Multilinear Grammar: Ranks and Interpretations", "abstract": "Multilinear Grammar provides a framework for integrating the many different\nsyntagmatic structures of language into a coherent semiotically based Rank\nInterpretation Architecture, with default linear grammars at each rank. The\narchitecture defines a Sui Generis Condition on ranks, from discourse through\nutterance and phrasal structures to the word, with its sub-ranks of morphology\nand phonology. Each rank has unique structures and its own semantic-pragmatic\nand prosodic-phonetic interpretation models. Default computational models for\neach rank are proposed, based on a Procedural Plausibility Condition:\nincremental processing in linear time with finite working memory. We suggest\nthat the Rank Interpretation Architecture and its multilinear properties\nprovide systematic design features of human languages, contrasting with\nunordered lists of key properties or single structural properties at one rank,\nsuch as recursion, which have previously been been put forward as language\ndesign features. The framework provides a realistic background for the gradual\ndevelopment of complexity in the phylogeny and ontogeny of language, and\nclarifies a range of challenges for the evaluation of realistic linguistic\ntheories and applications. The empirical objective of the paper is to\ndemonstrate unique multilinear properties at each rank and thereby motivate the\nMultilinear Grammar and Rank Interpretation Architecture framework as a\ncoherent approach to capturing the complexity of human languages in the\nsimplest possible way.", "published": "2016-09-18 16:29:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05511v5", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
