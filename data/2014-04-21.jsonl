{"title": "The Frobenius anatomy of word meanings I: subject and object relative\n  pronouns", "abstract": "This paper develops a compositional vector-based semantics of subject and\nobject relative pronouns within a categorical framework. Frobenius algebras are\nused to formalise the operations required to model the semantics of relative\npronouns, including passing information between the relative clause and the\nmodified noun phrase, as well as copying, combining, and discarding parts of\nthe relative clause. We develop two instantiations of the abstract semantics,\none based on a truth-theoretic approach and one based on corpus statistics.", "published": "2014-04-21 19:31:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5278v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
