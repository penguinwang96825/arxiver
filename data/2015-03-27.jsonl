{"title": "Normalization of Non-Standard Words in Croatian Texts", "abstract": "This paper presents text normalization which is an integral part of any\ntext-to-speech synthesis system. Text normalization is a set of methods with a\ntask to write non-standard words, like numbers, dates, times, abbreviations,\nacronyms and the most common symbols, in their full expanded form are\npresented. The whole taxonomy for classification of non-standard words in\nCroatian language together with rule-based normalization methods combined with\na lookup dictionary are proposed. Achieved token rate for normalization of\nCroatian texts is 95%, where 80% of expanded words are in correct morphological\nform.", "published": "2015-03-27 17:57:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08167v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Embedding Representations for Knowledge Inference on Imperfect\n  and Incomplete Repositories", "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of knowledge inference on large-scale\nimperfect repositories with incomplete coverage by means of embedding entities\nand relations at the first attempt. We propose IIKE (Imperfect and Incomplete\nKnowledge Embedding), a probabilistic model which measures the probability of\neach belief, i.e. $\\langle h,r,t\\rangle$, in large-scale knowledge bases such\nas NELL and Freebase, and our objective is to learn a better low-dimensional\nvector representation for each entity ($h$ and $t$) and relation ($r$) in the\nprocess of minimizing the loss of fitting the corresponding confidence given by\nmachine learning (NELL) or crowdsouring (Freebase), so that we can use $||{\\bf\nh} + {\\bf r} - {\\bf t}||$ to assess the plausibility of a belief when\nconducting inference. We use subsets of those inexact knowledge bases to train\nour model and test the performances of link prediction and triplet\nclassification on ground truth beliefs, respectively. The results of extensive\nexperiments show that IIKE achieves significant improvement compared with the\nbaseline and state-of-the-art approaches.", "published": "2015-03-27 17:13:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08155v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
