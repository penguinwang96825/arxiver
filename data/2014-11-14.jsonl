{"title": "Autonomization of Monoidal Categories", "abstract": "We show that contrary to common belief in the DisCoCat community, a monoidal\ncategory is all that is needed to define a categorical compositional model of\nnatural language. This relies on a construction which freely adds adjoints to a\nmonoidal category. In the case of distributional semantics, this broadens the\nrange of available models, to include non-linear maps and cartesian products\nfor instance. We illustrate the applications of this principle to various\ndistributional models of meaning.", "published": "2014-11-14 08:44:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3827v4", "categories": ["math.CT", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "math.CT"}
{"title": "Learning Multi-Relational Semantics Using Neural-Embedding Models", "abstract": "In this paper we present a unified framework for modeling multi-relational\nrepresentations, scoring, and learning, and conduct an empirical study of\nseveral recent multi-relational embedding models under the framework. We\ninvestigate the different choices of relation operators based on linear and\nbilinear transformations, and also the effects of entity representations by\nincorporating unsupervised vectors pre-trained on extra textual resources. Our\nresults show several interesting findings, enabling the design of a simple\nembedding model that achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on a popular\nknowledge base completion task evaluated on Freebase.", "published": "2014-11-14 22:08:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4072v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
