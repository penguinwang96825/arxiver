{"title": "Generating Music from Literature", "abstract": "We present a system, TransProse, that automatically generates musical pieces\nfrom text. TransProse uses known relations between elements of music such as\ntempo and scale, and the emotions they evoke. Further, it uses a novel\nmechanism to determine sequences of notes that capture the emotional activity\nin the text. The work has applications in information visualization, in\ncreating audio-visual e-books, and in developing music apps.", "published": "2014-03-10 01:41:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2124v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Parsing using a grammar of word association vectors", "abstract": "This paper was was first drafted in 2001 as a formalization of the system\ndescribed in U.S. patent U.S. 7,392,174. It describes a system for implementing\na parser based on a kind of cross-product over vectors of contextually similar\nwords. It is being published now in response to nascent interest in vector\ncombination models of syntax and semantics. The method used aggressive\nsubstitution of contextually similar words and word groups to enable product\nvectors to stay in the same space as their operands and make entire sentences\ncomparable syntactically, and potentially semantically. The vectors generated\nhad sufficient representational strength to generate parse trees at least\ncomparable with contemporary symbolic parsers.", "published": "2014-03-10 07:26:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2152v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
