{"title": "Group Sparse CNNs for Question Classification with Answer Sets", "abstract": "Question classification is an important task with wide applications. However,\ntraditional techniques treat questions as general sentences, ignoring the\ncorresponding answer data. In order to consider answer information into\nquestion modeling, we first introduce novel group sparse autoencoders which\nrefine question representation by utilizing group information in the answer\nset. We then propose novel group sparse CNNs which naturally learn question\nrepresentation with respect to their answers by implanting group sparse\nautoencoders into traditional CNNs. The proposed model significantly outperform\nstrong baselines on four datasets.", "published": "2017-10-07 18:30:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02717v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "OSU Multimodal Machine Translation System Report", "abstract": "This paper describes Oregon State University's submissions to the shared\nWMT'17 task \"multimodal translation task I\". In this task, all the sentence\npairs are image captions in different languages. The key difference between\nthis task and conventional machine translation is that we have corresponding\nimages as additional information for each sentence pair. In this paper, we\nintroduce a simple but effective system which takes an image shared between\ndifferent languages, feeding it into the both encoding and decoding side. We\nreport our system's performance for English-French and English-German with\nFlickr30K (in-domain) and MSCOCO (out-of-domain) datasets. Our system achieves\nthe best performance in TER for English-German for MSCOCO dataset.", "published": "2017-10-07 18:37:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02718v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multi-Document Summarization using Distributed Bag-of-Words Model", "abstract": "As the number of documents on the web is growing exponentially,\nmulti-document summarization is becoming more and more important since it can\nprovide the main ideas in a document set in short time. In this paper, we\npresent an unsupervised centroid-based document-level reconstruction framework\nusing distributed bag of words model. Specifically, our approach selects\nsummary sentences in order to minimize the reconstruction error between the\nsummary and the documents. We apply sentence selection and beam search, to\nfurther improve the performance of our model. Experimental results on two\ndifferent datasets show significant performance gains compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.", "published": "2017-10-07 20:43:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02745v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Topic Modeling based on Keywords and Context", "abstract": "Current topic models often suffer from discovering topics not matching human\nintuition, unnatural switching of topics within documents and high\ncomputational demands. We address these concerns by proposing a topic model and\nan inference algorithm based on automatically identifying characteristic\nkeywords for topics. Keywords influence topic-assignments of nearby words. Our\nalgorithm learns (key)word-topic scores and it self-regulates the number of\ntopics. Inference is simple and easily parallelizable. Qualitative analysis\nyields comparable results to state-of-the-art models (eg. LDA), but with\ndifferent strengths and weaknesses. Quantitative analysis using 9 datasets\nshows gains in terms of classification accuracy, PMI score, computational\nperformance and consistency of topic assignments within documents, while most\noften using less topics.", "published": "2017-10-07 08:18:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02650v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
