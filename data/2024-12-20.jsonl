{"title": "Correct implied volatility shapes and reliable pricing in the rough Heston model", "abstract": "We use modifications of the Adams method and very fast and accurate\nsinh-acceleration method of the Fourier inversion (iFT) (S.Boyarchenko and\nLevendorski\\u{i}, IJTAF 2019, v.22) to evaluate prices of vanilla options; for\noptions of moderate and long maturities and strikes not very far from the spot,\nthousands of prices can be calculated in several msec. with relative errors of\nthe order of 0.5\\% and smaller running Matlab on a Mac with moderate\ncharacteristics. We demonstrate that for the calibrated set of parameters in\nEuch and Rosenbaum, Math. Finance 2019, v. 29, the correct implied volatility\nsurface is significantly flatter and fits the data very poorly, hence, the\ncalibration results in op.cit. is an example of the {\\em ghost calibration}\n(M.Boyarchenko and Levendorki\\u{i}, Quantitative Finance 2015, v. 15): the\nerrors of the model and numerical method almost cancel one another. We explain\nhow calibration errors of this sort are generated by each of popular versions\nof numerical realizations of iFT (Carr-Madan, Lipton-Lewis and COS methods)\nwith prefixed parameters of a numerical method, resulting in spurious\nvolatility smiles and skews. We suggest a general {\\em Conformal Bootstrap\nprinciple} which allows one to avoid ghost calibration errors. We outline\nschemes of application of Conformal Bootstrap principle and the method of the\npaper to the design of accurate and fast calibration procedures.", "published": "2024-12-20 17:10:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16067v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.CP", "60-08, 60E10, 60G10, 60G22, 65C20, 65D30, 65G20, 91G20, 91G60"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Optimizing Fintech Marketing: A Comparative Study of Logistic Regression and XGBoost", "abstract": "As several studies have shown, predicting credit risk is still a major\nconcern for the financial services industry and is receiving a lot of scholarly\ninterest. This area of study is crucial because it aids financial organizations\nin determining the probability that borrowers would default, which has a direct\nbearing on lending choices and risk management tactics. Despite the progress\nmade in this domain, there is still a substantial knowledge gap concerning\nconsumer actions that take place prior to the filing of credit card\napplications. The objective of this study is to predict customer responses to\nmail campaigns and assess the likelihood of default among those who engage.\nThis research employs advanced machine learning techniques, specifically\nlogistic regression and XGBoost, to analyze consumer behavior and predict\nresponses to direct mail campaigns. By integrating different data preprocessing\nstrategies, including imputation and binning, we enhance the robustness and\naccuracy of our predictive models. The results indicate that XGBoost\nconsistently outperforms logistic regression across various metrics,\nparticularly in scenarios using categorical binning and custom imputation.\nThese findings suggest that XGBoost is particularly effective in handling\ncomplex data structures and provides a strong predictive capability in\nassessing credit risk.", "published": "2024-12-20 20:45:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16333v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.ST", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Differentially Private Federated Learning of Diffusion Models for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation", "abstract": "The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in finance\nnecessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold\nprivacy standards. We introduce DP-Fed-FinDiff framework, a novel integration\nof Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data.\nThis framework ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations while\nmaintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-Fed-FinDiff on\nmultiple real-world financial datasets, achieving significant improvements in\nprivacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations\nreveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations,\nand federated optimization strategies.

{"title": "Battery valuation on electricity intraday markets with liquidity costs", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a complete modelling framework to value several\nbatteries in the electricity intraday market at the trading session scale. The\nmodel consists of a stochastic model for the 24 mid-prices (one price per\ndelivery hour) combined with a deterministic model for the liquidity costs\n(representing the cost of going deeper in the order book). A stochastic\noptimisation framework based on dynamic programming is used to calculate the\nvalue of the batteries. We carry out a back test for the years 2021, 2022 and\n2023 for the German market and for the French market. We show that it is\nessential to take liquidity into account, especially when the number of\nbatteries is large: it allows much higher profits and avoids high losses using\nour liquidity model. The use of our stochastic model for the mid-price also\nsignificantly improves the results (compared to a deterministic framework where\nthe mid-price forecast is the spot price).", "published": "2024-12-20 14:52:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15959v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
