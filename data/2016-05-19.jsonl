{"title": "Stereotyping and Bias in the Flickr30K Dataset", "abstract": "An untested assumption behind the crowdsourced descriptions of the images in\nthe Flickr30K dataset (Young et al., 2014) is that they \"focus only on the\ninformation that can be obtained from the image alone\" (Hodosh et al., 2013, p.\n859). This paper presents some evidence against this assumption, and provides a\nlist of biases and unwarranted inferences that can be found in the Flickr30K\ndataset. Finally, it considers methods to find examples of these, and discusses\nhow we should deal with stereotype-driven descriptions in future applications.", "published": "2016-05-19 19:17:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06083v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Twitter as a Lifeline: Human-annotated Twitter Corpora for NLP of\n  Crisis-related Messages", "abstract": "Microblogging platforms such as Twitter provide active communication channels\nduring mass convergence and emergency events such as earthquakes, typhoons.\nDuring the sudden onset of a crisis situation, affected people post useful\ninformation on Twitter that can be used for situational awareness and other\nhumanitarian disaster response efforts, if processed timely and effectively.\nProcessing social media information pose multiple challenges such as parsing\nnoisy, brief and informal messages, learning information categories from the\nincoming stream of messages and classifying them into different classes among\nothers. One of the basic necessities of many of these tasks is the availability\nof data, in particular human-annotated data. In this paper, we present\nhuman-annotated Twitter corpora collected during 19 different crises that took\nplace between 2013 and 2015. To demonstrate the utility of the annotations, we\ntrain machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we publish first largest word2vec\nword embeddings trained on 52 million crisis-related tweets. To deal with\ntweets language issues, we present human-annotated normalized lexical resources\nfor different lexical variations.", "published": "2016-05-19 11:32:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05894v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Hierarchical Latent Variable Encoder-Decoder Model for Generating\n  Dialogues", "abstract": "Sequential data often possesses a hierarchical structure with complex\ndependencies between subsequences, such as found between the utterances in a\ndialogue. In an effort to model this kind of generative process, we propose a\nneural network-based generative architecture, with latent stochastic variables\nthat span a variable number of time steps. We apply the proposed model to the\ntask of dialogue response generation and compare it with recent neural network\narchitectures. We evaluate the model performance through automatic evaluation\nmetrics and by carrying out a human evaluation. The experiments demonstrate\nthat our model improves upon recently proposed models and that the latent\nvariables facilitate the generation of long outputs and maintain the context.", "published": "2016-05-19 17:59:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06069v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "I.5.1; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
