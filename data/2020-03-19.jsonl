{"title": "QnAMaker: Data to Bot in 2 Minutes", "abstract": "Having a bot for seamless conversations is a much-desired feature that products and services today seek for their websites and mobile apps. These bots help reduce traffic received by human support significantly by handling frequent and directly answerable known questions. Many such services have huge reference documents such as FAQ pages, which makes it hard for users to browse through this data. A conversation layer over such raw data can lower traffic to human support by a great margin. We demonstrate QnAMaker, a service that creates a conversational layer over semi-structured data such as FAQ pages, product manuals, and support documents. QnAMaker is the popular choice for Extraction and Question-Answering as a service and is used by over 15,000 bots in production. It is also used by search interfaces and not just bots.", "published": "2020-03-19 03:32:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08553v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Adjust Planning Strategies to Accommodate Reinforcement Learning Agents", "abstract": "In agent control issues, the idea of combining reinforcement learning and planning has attracted much attention. Two methods focus on micro and macro action respectively. Their advantages would show together if there is a good cooperation between them. An essential for the cooperation is to find an appropriate boundary, assigning different functions to each method. Such boundary could be represented by parameters in a planning algorithm. In this paper, we create an optimization strategy for planning parameters, through analysis to the connection of reaction and planning; we also create a non-gradient method for accelerating the optimization. The whole algorithm can find a satisfactory setting of planning parameters, making full use of reaction capability of specific agents.", "published": "2020-03-19 03:35:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08554v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Lifelong Learning with Searchable Extension Units", "abstract": "Lifelong learning remains an open problem. One of its main difficulties is catastrophic forgetting. Many dynamic expansion approaches have been proposed to address this problem, but they all use homogeneous models of predefined structure for all tasks. The common original model and expansion structures ignore the requirement of different model structures on different tasks, which leads to a less compact model for multiple tasks and causes the model size to increase rapidly as the number of tasks increases. Moreover, they can not perform best on all tasks. To solve those problems, in this paper, we propose a new lifelong learning framework named Searchable Extension Units (SEU) by introducing Neural Architecture Search into lifelong learning, which breaks down the need for a predefined original model and searches for specific extension units for different tasks, without compromising the performance of the model on different tasks. Our approach can obtain a much more compact model without catastrophic forgetting. The experimental results on the PMNIST, the split CIFAR10 dataset, the split CIFAR100 dataset, and the Mixture dataset empirically prove that our method can achieve higher accuracy with much smaller model, whose size is about 25-33 percentage of that of the state-of-the-art methods.", "published": "2020-03-19 03:45:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08559v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "HyNNA: Improved Performance for Neuromorphic Vision Sensor based Surveillance using Hybrid Neural Network Architecture", "abstract": "Applications in the Internet of Video Things (IoVT) domain have very tight constraints with respect to power and area. While neuromorphic vision sensors (NVS) may offer advantages over traditional imagers in this domain, the existing NVS systems either do not meet the power constraints or have not demonstrated end-to-end system performance. To address this, we improve on a recently proposed hybrid event-frame approach by using morphological image processing algorithms for region proposal and address the low-power requirement for object detection and classification by exploring various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Specifically, we compare the results obtained from our object detection framework against the state-of-the-art low-power NVS surveillance system and show an improved accuracy of 82.16% from 63.1%. Moreover, we show that using multiple bits does not improve accuracy, and thus, system designers can save power and area by using only single bit event polarity information. In addition, we explore the CNN architecture space for object classification and show useful insights to trade-off accuracy for lower power using lesser memory and arithmetic operations.", "published": "2020-03-19 07:18:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08603v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "End-to-End Deep Diagnosis of X-ray Images", "abstract": "In this work, we present an end-to-end deep learning framework for X-ray image diagnosis. As the first step, our system determines whether a submitted image is an X-ray or not. After it classifies the type of the X-ray, it runs the dedicated abnormality classification network. In this work, we only focus on the chest X-rays for abnormality classification. However, the system can be extended to other X-ray types easily. Our deep learning classifiers are based on DenseNet-121 architecture. The test set accuracy obtained for 'X-ray or Not', 'X-ray Type Classification', and 'Chest Abnormality Classification' tasks are 0.987, 0.976, and 0.947, respectively, resulting into an end-to-end accuracy of 0.91. For achieving better results than the state-of-the-art in the 'Chest Abnormality Classification', we utilize the new RAdam optimizer. We also use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping for visual explanation of the results. Our results show the feasibility of a generalized online projectional radiography diagnosis system.", "published": "2020-03-19 07:20:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08605v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Semi-closed form solutions for barrier and American options written on a time-dependent Ornstein Uhlenbeck process", "abstract": "In this paper we develop a semi-closed form solutions for the barrier (perhaps, time-dependent) and American options written on the underlying stock which follows a time-dependent OU process with a log-normal drift. This model is equivalent to the familiar Hull-White model in FI, or a time dependent OU model in FX. Semi-closed form means that given the time-dependent interest rate, continuous dividend and volatility functions, one need to solve numerically a linear (for the barrier option) or nonlinear (for the American option) Fredholm equation of the first kind. After that the option prices in all cases are presented as one-dimensional integrals of combination of the above solutions and Jacobi theta functions. We also demonstrate that computationally our method is more efficient than the backward finite difference method used for solving these problems, and can also be as efficient as the forward finite difference solver while providing better accuracy and stability.", "published": "2020-03-19 15:04:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08853v2", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
{"title": "Clustering with Fast, Automated and Reproducible assessment applied to longitudinal neural tracking", "abstract": "Across many areas, from neural tracking to database entity resolution, manual assessment of clusters by human experts presents a bottleneck in rapid development of scalable and specialized clustering methods. To solve this problem we develop C-FAR, a novel method for Fast, Automated and Reproducible assessment of multiple hierarchical clustering algorithms simultaneously. Our algorithm takes any number of hierarchical clustering trees as input, then strategically queries pairs for human feedback, and outputs an optimal clustering among those nominated by these trees. While it is applicable to large dataset in any domain that utilizes pairwise comparisons for assessment, our flagship application is the cluster aggregation step in spike-sorting, the task of assigning waveforms (spikes) in recordings to neurons. On simulated data of 96 neurons under adverse conditions, including drifting and 25\\% blackout, our algorithm produces near-perfect tracking relative to the ground truth. Our runtime scales linearly in the number of input trees, making it a competitive computational tool. These results indicate that C-FAR is highly suitable as a model selection and assessment tool in clustering tasks.", "published": "2020-03-19 01:33:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08533v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "q-bio.QM"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Cyclic Prefix Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Capacity Analysis", "abstract": "Cyclic Prefix Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (CP-DSSS) is a novel waveform that is proposed as a solution to massive machine type communications (mMTC) for 5G and beyond. This paper analyzes the capacity of CP-DSSS in comparison with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). We show that CP-DSSS achieves the same capacity as OFDM and can be optimized with similar precoding methods (e.g., water-filling). Because of its spread spectrum nature, CP-DSSS can operate as secondary network using the same spectrum as the primary 4G or 5G network, but transmitting at much lower power. Accordingly, the combination of primary and secondary signals in the envisioned setup may be viewed as a power NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) technique where primary signals are detected and subtracted from the received signal first before detecting the secondary signals. In order to operate at a sufficiently low interference level to the primary network, details of CP-DSSS capacity for symbol rate reduction and multi-antenna operation are developed. The capacity limits established in this paper can be used as a baseline to evaluate the performance of future CP-DSSS receiver architectures for single- and multi-user scenarios.", "published": "2020-03-19 06:50:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08599v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Multi-user Capacity of Cyclic Prefix Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum with Linear Detection and Precoding", "abstract": "Cyclic Prefix Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (CP-DSSS) is a promising solution for futuristic 6G ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine type communication (mMTC) applications. We propose that in such applications, the CP-DSSS waveform would operate as a secondary network at the same frequencies as the primary network but at much lower SNR. In this paper, we evaluate per-user capacity of CP-DSSS when simple matched filtering (MF) is performed on the uplink (UL) and time-reversal (TR) precoding is used on the downlink (DL). In this setting when operating in the low SNR regime, CP-DSSS achieves a per-user capacity that is near the optimum single-user capacity. TR precoding converges to the optimal capacity as the number of antennas at the hub/gateway increases. Using the estimated channel impulse response for MF and TR introduces little to no capacity loss. Given the near-optimal performance of MF detection and TR precoding for each of the users, CP-DSSS can be implemented with simple device transceiver structures, reducing per-unit cost for massively deployed 6G networks.", "published": "2020-03-19 07:23:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08606v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Decoding Imagined Speech from EEG", "abstract": "The recent advances in the field of deep learning have not been fully utilised for decoding imagined speech primarily because of the unavailability of sufficient training samples to train a deep network. In this paper, we present a novel architecture that employs deep neural network (DNN) for classifying the words \"in\" and \"cooperate\" from the corresponding EEG signals in the ASU imagined speech dataset. Nine EEG channels, which best capture the underlying cortical activity, are chosen using common spatial pattern (CSP) and are treated as independent data vectors. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used for feature extraction. To the best of our knowledge, so far DNN has not been employed as a classifier in decoding imagined speech. Treating the selected EEG channels corresponding to each imagined word as independent data vectors helps in providing sufficient number of samples to train a DNN. For each test trial, the final class label is obtained by applying a majority voting on the classification results of the individual channels considered in the trial. We have achieved accuracies comparable to the state-of-the-art results. The results can be further improved by using a higher-density EEG acquisition system in conjunction with other deep learning techniques such as long short-term memory.", "published": "2020-03-19 00:57:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09374v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
