{"title": "The semantic similarity ensemble", "abstract": "Computational measures of semantic similarity between geographic terms\nprovide valuable support across geographic information retrieval, data mining,\nand information integration. To date, a wide variety of approaches to\ngeo-semantic similarity have been devised. A judgment of similarity is not\nintrinsically right or wrong, but obtains a certain degree of cognitive\nplausibility, depending on how closely it mimics human behavior. Thus selecting\nthe most appropriate measure for a specific task is a significant challenge. To\naddress this issue, we make an analogy between computational similarity\nmeasures and soliciting domain expert opinions, which incorporate a subjective\nset of beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and epistemic biases. Following this\nanalogy, we define the semantic similarity ensemble (SSE) as a composition of\ndifferent similarity measures, acting as a panel of experts having to reach a\ndecision on the semantic similarity of a set of geographic terms. The approach\nis evaluated in comparison to human judgments, and results indicate that an SSE\nperforms better than the average of its parts. Although the best member tends\nto outperform the ensemble, all ensembles outperform the average performance of\neach ensemble's member. Hence, in contexts where the best measure is unknown,\nthe ensemble provides a more cognitively plausible approach.", "published": "2014-01-11 10:35:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2517v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
