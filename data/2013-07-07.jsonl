{"title": "Intelligent Hybrid Man-Machine Translation Quality Estimation", "abstract": "Inferring evaluation scores based on human judgments is invaluable compared\nto using current evaluation metrics which are not suitable for real-time\napplications e.g. post-editing. However, these judgments are much more\nexpensive to collect especially from expert translators, compared to evaluation\nbased on indicators contrasting source and translation texts. This work\nintroduces a novel approach for quality estimation by combining learnt\nconfidence scores from a probabilistic inference model based on human\njudgments, with selective linguistic features-based scores, where the proposed\ninference model infers the credibility of given human ranks to solve the\nscarcity and inconsistency issues of human judgments. Experimental results,\nusing challenging language-pairs, demonstrate improvement in correlation with\nhuman judgments over traditional evaluation metrics.", "published": "2013-07-07 15:04:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1872v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
