{"title": "Adaptive User-Oriented Direct Load-Control of Residential Flexible Devices", "abstract": "Demand Response (DR) schemes are effective tools to maintain a dynamic balance in energy markets with higher integration of fluctuating renewable energy sources. DR schemes can be used to harness residential devices' flexibility and to utilize it to achieve social and financial objectives. However, existing DR schemes suffer from low user participation as they fail at taking into account the users' requirements. First, DR schemes are highly demanding for the users, as users need to provide direct information, e.g. via surveys, on their energy consumption preferences. Second, the user utility models based on these surveys are hard-coded and do not adapt over time. Third, the existing scheduling techniques require the users to input their energy requirements on a daily basis. As an alternative, this paper proposes a DR scheme for user-oriented direct load-control of residential appliances operations. Instead of relying on user surveys to evaluate the user utility, we propose an online data-driven approach for estimating user utility functions, purely based on available load consumption data, that adaptively models the users' preference over time. Our scheme is based on a day-ahead scheduling technique that transparently prescribes the users with optimal device operation schedules that take into account both financial benefits and user-perceived quality of service. To model day-ahead user energy demand and flexibility, we propose a probabilistic approach for generating flexibility models under uncertainty. Results on both real-world and simulated datasets show that our DR scheme can provide significant financial benefits while preserving the user-perceived quality of service.", "published": "2018-05-09 12:36:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05470v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Symmetric Rendezvous With Advice: How to Rendezvous in a Disk", "abstract": "In the classic Symmetric Rendezvous problem on a Line (SRL), two robots at known distance 2 but unknown direction execute the same randomized algorithm trying to minimize the expected rendezvous time. A long standing conjecture is that the best possible rendezvous time is 4.25 with known upper and lower bounds being very close to that value. We introduce and study a geometric variation of SRL that we call Symmetric Rendezvous in a Disk (SRD) where two robots at distance 2 have a common reference point at distance $\u03c1$. We show that even when $\u03c1$ is not too small, the two robots can meet in expected time that is less than $4.25$. Part of our contribution is that we demonstrate how to adjust known, even simple and provably non-optimal, algorithms for SRL, effectively improving their performance in the presence of a reference point. Special to our algorithms for SRD is that, unlike in SRL, for every fixed $\u03c1$ the worst case distance traveled, i.e. energy that is used, in our algorithms is finite. In particular, we show that the energy of our algorithms is $O\\left(\u03c1^2\\right)$, while we also explore time-energy tradeoffs, concluding that one may be efficient both with respect to time and energy, with only a minor compromise on the optimal termination time.", "published": "2018-05-09 02:13:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03351v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
