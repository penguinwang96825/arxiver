{"title": "TEI and LMF crosswalks", "abstract": "The present paper explores various arguments in favour of making the Text\nEncoding Initia-tive (TEI) guidelines an appropriate serialisation for ISO\nstandard 24613:2008 (LMF, Lexi-cal Mark-up Framework) . It also identifies the\nissues that would have to be resolved in order to reach an appropriate\nimplementation of these ideas, in particular in terms of infor-mational\ncoverage. We show how the customisation facilities offered by the TEI\nguidelines can provide an adequate background, not only to cover missing\ncomponents within the current Dictionary chapter of the TEI guidelines, but\nalso to allow specific lexical projects to deal with local constraints. We\nexpect this proposal to be a basis for a future ISO project in the context of\nthe on going revision of LMF.", "published": "2013-01-11 10:38:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2444v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Dating medieval English charters", "abstract": "Deeds, or charters, dealing with property rights, provide a continuous\ndocumentation which can be used by historians to study the evolution of social,\neconomic and political changes. This study is concerned with charters (written\nin Latin) dating from the tenth through early fourteenth centuries in England.\nOf these, at least one million were left undated, largely due to administrative\nchanges introduced by William the Conqueror in 1066. Correctly dating such\ncharters is of vital importance in the study of English medieval history. This\npaper is concerned with computer-automated statistical methods for dating such\ndocument collections, with the goal of reducing the considerable efforts\nrequired to date them manually and of improving the accuracy of assigned dates.\nProposed methods are based on such data as the variation over time of word and\nphrase usage, and on measures of distance between documents. The extensive (and\ndated) Documents of Early England Data Set (DEEDS) maintained at the University\nof Toronto was used for this purpose.", "published": "2013-01-11 07:46:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2405v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
