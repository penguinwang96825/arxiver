{"title": "Collaborative Optimization in Financial Data Mining Through Deep Learning and ResNeXt", "abstract": "This study proposes a multi-task learning framework based on ResNeXt, aiming\nto solve the problem of feature extraction and task collaborative optimization\nin financial data mining. Financial data usually has the complex\ncharacteristics of high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and time series, and is\naccompanied by potential correlations between multiple tasks, making it\ndifficult for traditional methods to meet the needs of data mining. This study\nintroduces the ResNeXt model into the multi-task learning framework and makes\nfull use of its group convolution mechanism to achieve efficient extraction of\nlocal patterns and global features of financial data. At the same time, through\nthe design of task sharing layers and dedicated layers, it is established\nbetween multiple related tasks. Deep collaborative optimization relationships.\nThrough flexible multi-task loss weight design, the model can effectively\nbalance the learning needs of different tasks and improve overall performance.\nExperiments are conducted on a real S&P 500 financial data set, verifying the\nsignificant advantages of the proposed framework in classification and\nregression tasks. The results indicate that, when compared to other\nconventional deep learning models, the proposed method delivers superior\nperformance in terms of accuracy, F1 score, root mean square error, and other\nmetrics, highlighting its outstanding effectiveness and robustness in handling\ncomplex financial data. This research provides an efficient and adaptable\nsolution for financial data mining, and at the same time opens up a new\nresearch direction for the combination of multi-task learning and deep\nlearning, which has important theoretical significance and practical\napplication value.", "published": "2024-12-23 06:14:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17314v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Broker-Trader Partial Information Nash-Equilibria", "abstract": "We study partial information Nash equilibrium between a broker and an\ninformed trader. In this setting, the informed trader, who possesses knowledge\nof a trading signal, trades multiple assets with the broker in a dealer market.\nSimultaneously, the broker offloads these assets in a lit exchange where their\nactions impact the asset prices. The broker, however, only observes aggregate\nprices and cannot distinguish between underlying trends and volatility. Both\nthe broker and the informed trader aim to maximize their penalized expected\nwealth. Using convex analysis, we characterize the Nash equilibrium and\ndemonstrate its existence and uniqueness. Furthermore, we establish that this\nequilibrium corresponds to the solution of a nonstandard system of\nforward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) that involves the\ntwo differing filtrations. For short enough time horizons, we prove that a\nunique solution of this system exists. Finally, under quite general\nassumptions, we show that the solution to the FBSDE system admits a polynomial\napproximation in the strength of the transient impact to arbitrary order, and\nprove that the error is controlled.", "published": "2024-12-23 16:45:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17712v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}

{"title": "Time Series Feature Redundancy Paradox: An Empirical Study Based on Mortgage Default Prediction", "abstract": "With the widespread application of machine learning in financial risk\nmanagement, conventional wisdom suggests that longer training periods and more\nfeature variables contribute to improved model performance. This paper,\nfocusing on mortgage default prediction, empirically discovers a phenomenon\nthat contradicts traditional knowledge: in time series prediction, increased\ntraining data timespan and additional non-critical features actually lead to\nsignificant deterioration in prediction effectiveness. Using Fannie Mae's\nmortgage data, the study compares predictive performance across different time\nwindow lengths (2012-2022) and feature combinations, revealing that shorter\ntime windows (such as single-year periods) paired with carefully selected key\nfeatures yield superior prediction results. The experimental results indicate\nthat extended time spans may introduce noise from historical data and outdated\nmarket patterns, while excessive non-critical features interfere with the\nmodel's learning of core default factors. This research not only challenges the\ntraditional \"more is better\" approach in data modeling but also provides new\ninsights and practical guidance for feature selection and time window\noptimization in financial risk prediction.", "published": "2024-12-23 21:28:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00034v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
