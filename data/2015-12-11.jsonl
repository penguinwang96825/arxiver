{"title": "Words are not Equal: Graded Weighting Model for building Composite\n  Document Vectors", "abstract": "Despite the success of distributional semantics, composing phrases from word\nvectors remains an important challenge. Several methods have been tried for\nbenchmark tasks such as sentiment classification, including word vector\naveraging, matrix-vector approaches based on parsing, and on-the-fly learning\nof paragraph vectors. Most models usually omit stop words from the composition.\nInstead of such an yes-no decision, we consider several graded schemes where\nwords are weighted according to their discriminatory relevance with respect to\nits use in the document (e.g., idf). Some of these methods (particularly\ntf-idf) are seen to result in a significant improvement in performance over\nprior state of the art. Further, combining such approaches into an ensemble\nbased on alternate classifiers such as the RNN model, results in an 1.6%\nperformance improvement on the standard IMDB movie review dataset, and a 7.01%\nimprovement on Amazon product reviews. Since these are language free models and\ncan be obtained in an unsupervised manner, they are of interest also for\nunder-resourced languages such as Hindi as well and many more languages. We\ndemonstrate the language free aspects by showing a gain of 12% for two review\ndatasets over earlier results, and also release a new larger dataset for future\ntesting (Singh,2015).", "published": "2015-12-11 08:44:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03549v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
