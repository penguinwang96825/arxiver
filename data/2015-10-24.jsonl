{"title": "Combine CRF and MMSEG to Boost Chinese Word Segmentation in Social Media", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a joint algorithm for the word segmentation on\nChinese social media. Previous work mainly focus on word segmentation for plain\nChinese text, in order to develop a Chinese social media processing tool, we\nneed to take the main features of social media into account, whose grammatical\nstructure is not rigorous, and the tendency of using colloquial and Internet\nterms makes the existing Chinese-processing tools inefficient to obtain good\nperformance on social media.\n  In our approach, we combine CRF and MMSEG algorithm and extend features of\ntraditional CRF algorithm to train the model for word segmentation, We use\nInternet lexicon in order to improve the performance of our model on Chinese\nsocial media. Our experimental result on Sina Weibo shows that our approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art model.", "published": "2015-10-24 02:24:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07099v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
