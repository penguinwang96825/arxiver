{"title": "Formality Style Transfer with Hybrid Textual Annotations", "abstract": "Formality style transformation is the task of modifying the formality of a\ngiven sentence without changing its content. Its challenge is the lack of\nlarge-scale sentence-aligned parallel data. In this paper, we propose an\nomnivorous model that takes parallel data and formality-classified data jointly\nto alleviate the data sparsity issue. We empirically demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach by achieving the state-of-art performance on a\nrecently proposed benchmark dataset of formality transfer. Furthermore, our\nmodel can be readily adapted to other unsupervised text style transfer tasks\nlike unsupervised sentiment transfer and achieve competitive results on three\nwidely recognized benchmarks.", "published": "2019-03-15 04:08:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06353v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Studying the Inductive Biases of RNNs with Synthetic Variations of\n  Natural Languages", "abstract": "How do typological properties such as word order and morphological case\nmarking affect the ability of neural sequence models to acquire the syntax of a\nlanguage? Cross-linguistic comparisons of RNNs' syntactic performance (e.g., on\nsubject-verb agreement prediction) are complicated by the fact that any two\nlanguages differ in multiple typological properties, as well as by differences\nin training corpus. We propose a paradigm that addresses these issues: we\ncreate synthetic versions of English, which differ from English in one or more\ntypological parameters, and generate corpora for those languages based on a\nparsed English corpus. We report a series of experiments in which RNNs were\ntrained to predict agreement features for verbs in each of those synthetic\nlanguages. Among other findings, (1) performance was higher in\nsubject-verb-object order (as in English) than in subject-object-verb order (as\nin Japanese), suggesting that RNNs have a recency bias; (2) predicting\nagreement with both subject and object (polypersonal agreement) improves over\npredicting each separately, suggesting that underlying syntactic knowledge\ntransfers across the two tasks; and (3) overt morphological case makes\nagreement prediction significantly easier, regardless of word order.", "published": "2019-03-15 08:06:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06400v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Content Differences in Syntactic and Semantic Representations", "abstract": "Syntactic analysis plays an important role in semantic parsing, but the\nnature of this role remains a topic of ongoing debate. The debate has been\nconstrained by the scarcity of empirical comparative studies between syntactic\nand semantic schemes, which hinders the development of parsing methods informed\nby the details of target schemes and constructions. We target this gap, and\ntake Universal Dependencies (UD) and UCCA as a test case. After abstracting\naway from differences of convention or formalism, we find that most content\ndivergences can be ascribed to: (1) UCCA's distinction between a Scene and a\nnon-Scene; (2) UCCA's distinction between primary relations, secondary ones and\nparticipants; (3) different treatment of multi-word expressions, and (4)\ndifferent treatment of inter-clause linkage. We further discuss the long tail\nof cases where the two schemes take markedly different approaches. Finally, we\nshow that the proposed comparison methodology can be used for fine-grained\nevaluation of UCCA parsing, highlighting both challenges and potential sources\nfor improvement. The substantial differences between the schemes suggest that\nsemantic parsers are likely to benefit downstream text understanding\napplications beyond their syntactic counterparts.", "published": "2019-03-15 12:44:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06494v5", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "On Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbations for Sequence-to-Sequence\n  Models", "abstract": "Adversarial examples --- perturbations to the input of a model that elicit\nlarge changes in the output --- have been shown to be an effective way of\nassessing the robustness of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. However,\nthese perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change\nthe input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the\nexpected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the\ngrowing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on\nmachine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial\nattacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and\npost-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that\nexisting methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the\naforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in\nchanges in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate\nthat adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial\nperturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change\nthe output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial\ntraining with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of\nadversarial robustness, without hurting test performance.

{"title": "A Context-Aware Citation Recommendation Model with BERT and Graph\n  Convolutional Networks", "abstract": "With the tremendous growth in the number of scientific papers being\npublished, searching for references while writing a scientific paper is a\ntime-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference citation at the\nappropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective,\ncontext-aware citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two\ndecades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context\nsentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target\npaper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of\nwell-organized benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high\nperformance has made the research difficult.\n  In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model and well-organized\ndataset for context-aware paper citation recommendation. Our model comprises a\ndocument encoder and a context encoder, which uses Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCN) layer and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT),\nwhich is a pre-trained model of textual data. By modifying the related PeerRead\ndataset, we propose a new dataset called FullTextPeerRead containing context\nsentences to cited references and paper metadata. To the best of our knowledge,\nThis dataset is the first well-organized dataset for context-aware paper\nrecommendation. The results indicate that the proposed model with the proposed\ndatasets can attain state-of-the-art performance and achieve a more than 28%\nimprovement in mean average precision (MAP) and recall@k.", "published": "2019-03-15 11:13:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06464v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Sound and ear\nrecognition rates were obtained using classical (hand-crafted) and deep\nlearning algorithms.
