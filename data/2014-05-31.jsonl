{"title": "Bridging the gap between Legal Practitioners and Knowledge Engineers\n  using semi-formal KR", "abstract": "The use of Structured English as a computation independent knowledge\nrepresentation format for non-technical users in business rules representation\nhas been proposed in OMGs Semantics and Business Vocabulary Representation\n(SBVR). In the legal domain we face a similar problem. Formal representation\nlanguages, such as OASIS LegalRuleML and legal ontologies (LKIF, legal OWL2\nontologies etc.) support the technical knowledge engineer and the automated\nreasoning. But, they can be hardly used directly by the legal domain experts\nwho do not have a computer science background. In this paper we adapt the SBVR\nStructured English approach for the legal domain and implement a\nproof-of-concept, called KR4IPLaw, which enables legal domain experts to\nrepresent their knowledge in Structured English in a computational independent\nand hence, for them, more usable way. The benefit of this approach is that the\nunderlying pre-defined semantics of the Structured English approach makes\ntransformations into formal languages such as OASIS LegalRuleML and OWL2\nontologies possible. We exemplify our approach in the domain of patent law.", "published": "2014-05-31 14:16:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0079v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "K.6.3; D.2.5; F.4.1"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
