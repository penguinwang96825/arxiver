{"title": "Modelling Agents Endowed with Social Practices: Static Aspects", "abstract": "To understand societal phenomena through simulation, we need computational variants of socio-cognitive theories. Social Practice Theory has provided a unique understanding of social phenomena regarding the routinized, social and interconnected aspects of behaviour. This paper provides the Social Practice Agent (SoPrA) model that enables the use of Social Practice Theory (SPT) for agent-based simulations. We extract requirements from SPT, construct a computational model in the Unified Modelling Language, verify its implementation in Netlogo and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and show how SoPrA maps on a use case of commuting. The next step is to model the dynamic aspect of SPT and validate SoPrA's ability to provide understanding in different scenario's. This paper provides the groundwork with a computational model that is a correct depiction of SPT, computational feasible and can be directly mapped to the habitual, social and interconnected aspects of a target scenario.", "published": "2018-11-27 13:49:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10981v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Lagged correlation-based deep learning for directional trend change prediction in financial time series", "abstract": "Trend change prediction in complex systems with a large number of noisy time series is a problem with many applications for real-world phenomena, with stock markets as a notoriously difficult to predict example of such systems. We approach predictions of directional trend changes via complex lagged correlations between them, excluding any information about the target series from the respective inputs to achieve predictions purely based on such correlations with other series. We propose the use of deep neural networks that employ step-wise linear regressions with exponential smoothing in the preparatory feature engineering for this task, with regression slopes as trend strength indicators for a given time interval. We apply this method to historical stock market data from 2011 to 2016 as a use case example of lagged correlations between large numbers of time series that are heavily influenced by externally arising new information as a random factor. The results demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, with state-of-the-art accuracies and accounting for the statistical significance of the results for additional validation, as well as important implications for modern financial economics.", "published": "2018-11-27 22:03:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11287v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Simulation of Stylized Facts in Agent-Based Computational Economic Market Models", "abstract": "We study the qualitative and quantitative appearance of stylized facts in several agent-based computational economic market (ABCEM) models. We perform our simulations with the SABCEMM (Simulator for Agent-Based Computational Economic Market Models) tool recently introduced by the authors (Trimborn et al. 2019). Furthermore, we present novel ABCEM models created by recombining existing models and study them with respect to stylized facts as well. This can be efficiently performed by the SABCEMM tool thanks to its object-oriented software design. The code is available on GitHub (Trimborn et al. 2018), such that all results can be reproduced by the reader.", "published": "2018-11-27 22:07:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02726v2", "categories": ["econ.GN", "econ.EM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "econ.GN"}
