{"title": "Inferring Informational Goals from Free-Text Queries: A Bayesian\n  Approach", "abstract": "People using consumer software applications typically do not use technical\njargon when querying an online database of help topics. Rather, they attempt to\ncommunicate their goals with common words and phrases that describe software\nfunctionality in terms of structure and objects they understand. We describe a\nBayesian approach to modeling the relationship between words in a user's query\nfor assistance and the informational goals of the user. After reviewing the\ngeneral method, we describe several extensions that center on integrating\nadditional distinctions and structure about language usage and user goals into\nthe Bayesian models.", "published": "2013-01-30 15:04:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7382v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
