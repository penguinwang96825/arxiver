{"title": "The risks of mixing dependency lengths from sequences of different\n  length", "abstract": "Mixing dependency lengths from sequences of different length is a common\npractice in language research. However, the empirical distribution of\ndependency lengths of sentences of the same length differs from that of\nsentences of varying length and the distribution of dependency lengths depends\non sentence length for real sentences and also under the null hypothesis that\ndependencies connect vertices located in random positions of the sequence. This\nsuggests that certain results, such as the distribution of syntactic dependency\nlengths mixing dependencies from sentences of varying length, could be a mere\nconsequence of that mixing. Furthermore, differences in the global averages of\ndependency length (mixing lengths from sentences of varying length) for two\ndifferent languages do not simply imply a priori that one language optimizes\ndependency lengths better than the other because those differences could be due\nto differences in the distribution of sentence lengths and other factors.", "published": "2013-04-13 20:19:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3841v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
