To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning\nCompression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing\nthe accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory.

To address the\npersistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource\nlinguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy\npseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings.

We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect\nhigh-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing\npotential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues.

In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task.

A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end.

Recently, motivated by\nthe importance of high-frequency accuracy, a refiner model called PDERefiner\nutilizes diffusion models to refine outputs for every time step, since the\ndenoising process could increase the correctness of modeling high frequency\npart. For 1-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, refiner models can degrade the\namplitude of high frequency part better than not doing refinement process.\nHowever, for some other cases, the spectrum might be more complicated. For\nexample, for a harder PDE like Navior-Stokes equation, diffusion models could\nover-degrade the higher frequency part. This motivates us to release the\nconstraint that each frequency weighs the same. We enhance our refiner model\nwith doing adjustments on spectral space, which recovers Blurring diffusion\nmodels. We developed a new v-prediction technique for Blurring diffusion\nmodels, recovering the MSE training objective on the first refinement step.

{"title": "Automotive Radar Online Channel Imbalance Estimation via NLMS", "abstract": "Automotive radars are one of the essential enablers of advanced driver\nassistance systems (ADASs). Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation. In\nthis work, a novel method for online estimation of automotive radar channel\nimbalances is proposed. The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets. This property in\ncombination with low computational complexity of the NLMS, makes the proposed\nmethod suitable for online channel imbalance estimation, in parallel to the\nnormal operation of the radar. Furthermore, it features reduced dependency on\nspecific targets of interest and faster update rates of the channel imbalance\nestimation compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods.

We then extend\nthis space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,\nthereby characterizing NAHT.

We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE.\nResults show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in\ncomparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive\ndecoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in\nlarge-scale models.", "published": "2025-06-12 16:02:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12097v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CR", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Discrete Audio Tokens: More Than a Survey!", "abstract": "Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve\nperceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while\nenabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance\nacross diverse downstream tasks. They provide a practical alternative to\ncontinuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern\nlarge language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing\ngrows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have\nreviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often\nfocus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various\nbenchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete\naudio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We\npropose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,\nquantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application\ndomains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,\ndownstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs\nthrough controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,\npractical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance\nfor future research in this rapidly evolving area.
