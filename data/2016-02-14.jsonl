{"title": "Exploiting Lists of Names for Named Entity Identification of Financial\n  Institutions from Unstructured Documents", "abstract": "There is a wealth of information about financial systems that is embedded in\ndocument collections. In this paper, we focus on a specialized text extraction\ntask for this domain. The objective is to extract mentions of names of\nfinancial institutions, or FI names, from financial prospectus documents, and\nto identify the corresponding real world entities, e.g., by matching against a\ncorpus of such entities. The tasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and\nEntity Resolution (ER); both are well studied in the literature. Our\ncontribution is to develop a rule-based approach that will exploit lists of FI\nnames for both tasks; our solution is labeled Dict-based NER and Rank-based ER.\nSince the FI names are typically represented by a root, and a suffix that\nmodifies the root, we use these lists of FI names to create specialized root\nand suffix dictionaries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our specialized\nsolution for extracting FI names, we compare Dict-based NER with a general\npurpose rule-based NER solution, ORG NER. Our evaluation highlights the\nbenefits and limitations of specialized versus general purpose approaches, and\npresents additional suggestions for tuning and customization for FI name\nextraction. To our knowledge, our proposed solutions, Dict-based NER and\nRank-based ER, and the root and suffix dictionaries, are the first attempt to\nexploit specialized knowledge, i.e., lists of FI names, for rule-based NER and\nER.", "published": "2016-02-14 07:31:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04427v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
