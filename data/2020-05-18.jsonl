{"title": "Approaches to Improving Recognition of Underrepresented Named Entities in Hybrid ASR Systems", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a series of complementary approaches to improve the recognition of underrepresented named entities (NE) in hybrid ASR systems without compromising overall word error rate performance. The underrepresented words correspond to rare or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in the training data, and thereby can't be modeled reliably. We begin with graphemic lexicon which allows to drop the necessity of phonetic models in hybrid ASR. We study it under different settings and demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with underrepresented NEs. Next, we study the impact of neural language model (LM) with letter-based features derived to handle infrequent words. After that, we attempt to enrich representations of underrepresented NEs in pretrained neural LM by borrowing the embedding representations of rich-represented words. This let us gain significant performance improvement on underrepresented NE recognition. Finally, we boost the likelihood scores of utterances containing NEs in the word lattices rescored by neural LMs and gain further performance improvement. The combination of the aforementioned approaches improves NE recognition by up to 42% relatively.", "published": "2020-05-18 14:11:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08742v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Building BROOK: A Multi-modal and Facial Video Database for Human-Vehicle Interaction Research", "abstract": "With the growing popularity of Autonomous Vehicles, more opportunities have bloomed in the context of Human-Vehicle Interactions. However, the lack of comprehensive and concrete database support for such specific use case limits relevant studies in the whole design spaces. In this paper, we present our work-in-progress BROOK, a public multi-modal database with facial video records, which could be used to characterize drivers' affective states and driving styles. We first explain how we over-engineer such database in details, and what we have gained through a ten-month study. Then we showcase a Neural Network-based predictor, leveraging BROOK, which supports multi-modal prediction (including physiological data of heart rate and skin conductance and driving status data of speed)through facial videos. Finally, we discuss related issues when building such a database and our future directions in the context of BROOK. We believe BROOK is an essential building block for future Human-Vehicle Interaction Research.", "published": "2020-05-18 12:20:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08637v2", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
