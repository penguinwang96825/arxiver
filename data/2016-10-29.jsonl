{"title": "Finding Street Gang Members on Twitter", "abstract": "Most street gang members use Twitter to intimidate others, to present\noutrageous images and statements to the world, and to share recent illegal\nactivities. Their tweets may thus be useful to law enforcement agencies to\ndiscover clues about recent crimes or to anticipate ones that may occur.\nFinding these posts, however, requires a method to discover gang member Twitter\nprofiles. This is a challenging task since gang members represent a very small\npopulation of the 320 million Twitter users. This paper studies the problem of\nautomatically finding gang members on Twitter. It outlines a process to curate\none of the largest sets of verifiable gang member profiles that have ever been\nstudied. A review of these profiles establishes differences in the language,\nimages, YouTube links, and emojis gang members use compared to the rest of the\nTwitter population. Features from this review are used to train a series of\nsupervised classifiers. Our classifier achieves a promising F1 score with a low\nfalse positive rate.", "published": "2016-10-29 14:30:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09516v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
