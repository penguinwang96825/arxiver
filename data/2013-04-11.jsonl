{"title": "Extension of hidden markov model for recognizing large vocabulary of\n  sign language", "abstract": "Computers still have a long way to go before they can interact with users in\na truly natural fashion. From a users perspective, the most natural way to\ninteract with a computer would be through a speech and gesture interface.\nAlthough speech recognition has made significant advances in the past ten\nyears, gesture recognition has been lagging behind. Sign Languages (SL) are the\nmost accomplished forms of gestural communication. Therefore, their automatic\nanalysis is a real challenge, which is interestingly implied to their lexical\nand syntactic organization levels. Statements dealing with sign language occupy\na significant interest in the Automatic Natural Language Processing (ANLP)\ndomain. In this work, we are dealing with sign language recognition, in\nparticular of French Sign Language (FSL). FSL has its own specificities, such\nas the simultaneity of several parameters, the important role of the facial\nexpression or movement and the use of space for the proper utterance\norganization. Unlike speech recognition, Frensh sign language (FSL) events\noccur both sequentially and simultaneously. Thus, the computational processing\nof FSL is too complex than the spoken languages. We present a novel approach\nbased on HMM to reduce the recognition complexity.", "published": "2013-04-11 11:56:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3265v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
