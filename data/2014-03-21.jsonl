{"title": "An efficiency dependency parser using hybrid approach for tamil language", "abstract": "Natural language processing is a prompt research area across the country.\nParsing is one of the very crucial tool in language analysis system which aims\nto forecast the structural relationship among the words in a given sentence.\nMany researchers have already developed so many language tools but the accuracy\nis not meet out the human expectation level, thus the research is still exists.\nMachine translation is one of the major application area under Natural Language\nProcessing. While translation between one language to another language, the\nstructure identification of a sentence play a key role. This paper introduces\nthe hybrid way to solve the identification of relationship among the given\nwords in a sentence. In existing system is implemented using rule based\napproach, which is not suited in huge amount of data. The machine learning\napproaches is suitable for handle larger amount of data and also to get better\naccuracy via learning and training the system. The proposed approach takes a\nTamil sentence as an input and produce the result of a dependency relation as a\ntree like structure using hybrid approach. This proposed tool is very helpful\nfor researchers and act as an odd-on improve the quality of existing\napproaches.", "published": "2014-03-21 04:54:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6381v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
