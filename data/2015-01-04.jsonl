{"title": "Cross-language Wikipedia Editing of Okinawa, Japan", "abstract": "This article analyzes users who edit Wikipedia articles about Okinawa, Japan,\nin English and Japanese. It finds these users are among the most active and\ndedicated users in their primary languages, where they make many large,\nhigh-quality edits. However, when these users edit in their non-primary\nlanguages, they tend to make edits of a different type that are overall smaller\nin size and more often restricted to the narrow set of articles that exist in\nboth languages. Design changes to motivate wider contributions from users in\ntheir non-primary languages and to encourage multilingual users to transfer\nmore information across language divides are presented.", "published": "2015-01-04 10:10:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00657v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL", "cs.SI", "H.5.4, H.5.3"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
