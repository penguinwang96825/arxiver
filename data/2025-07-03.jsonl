In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm.

To\naddress this, we introduce \\textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for\nautoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local\ntokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.\nBesides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the\nAR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic\ntokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal\nattention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the\nde-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module\nto control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive\nexperiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and\noutperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \\textbf{2.59 FID}\nand \\textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the\nholistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image\nproperties such as textures, materials, and shapes.

We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations.

{"title": "Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization", "abstract": "Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of\nperforming effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling.

{"title": "Pinching-Antenna-Assisted Index Modulation: Channel Modeling, Transceiver Design, and Performance Analysis", "abstract": "In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)\nscheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the\nhardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the\nconventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by\nthe indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full\npotential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver\ndesign, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and\nperformance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel\nmodel is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the\ndeterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of\nwireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.\nNext, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is\ndesigned, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML\nperformance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)\nis derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding\nmethod is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by\njointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the\nwaveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all\nreceived signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its\nconventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna\nsystem is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.", "published": "2025-07-03 14:07:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02641v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
