{"title": "Distant IE by Bootstrapping Using Lists and Document Structure", "abstract": "Distant labeling for information extraction (IE) suffers from noisy training\ndata. We describe a way of reducing the noise associated with distant IE by\nidentifying coupling constraints between potential instance labels. As one\nexample of coupling, items in a list are likely to have the same label. A\nsecond example of coupling comes from analysis of document structure: in some\ncorpora, sections can be identified such that items in the same section are\nlikely to have the same label. Such sections do not exist in all corpora, but\nwe show that augmenting a large corpus with coupling constraints from even a\nsmall, well-structured corpus can improve performance substantially, doubling\nF1 on one task.", "published": "2016-01-04 19:46:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00620v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

We introduce an alternative objective function\nfor neural MT that maximizes the mutual information between the source and\ntarget sentences, modeling the bi-directional dependency of sources and\ntargets. We implement the model with a simple re-ranking method, and also\nintroduce a decoding algorithm that increases diversity in the N-best list\nproduced by the first pass. Applied to the WMT German/English and\nFrench/English tasks, the proposed models offers a consistent performance boost\non both standard LSTM and attention-based neural MT architectures.", "published": "2016-01-04 03:04:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00372v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
