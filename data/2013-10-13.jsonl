{"title": "Forecasting of Events by Tweet Data Mining", "abstract": "This paper describes the analysis of quantitative characteristics of frequent\nsets and association rules in the posts of Twitter microblogs related to\ndifferent event discussions. For the analysis, we used a theory of frequent\nsets, association rules and a theory of formal concept analysis. We revealed\nthe frequent sets and association rules which characterize the semantic\nrelations between the concepts of analyzed subjects. The support of some\nfrequent sets reaches its global maximum before the expected event but with\nsome time delay. Such frequent sets may be considered as predictive markers\nthat characterize the significance of expected events for blogosphere users. We\nshowed that the time dynamics of confidence in some revealed association rules\ncan also have predictive characteristics. Exceeding a certain threshold may be\na signal for corresponding reaction in the society within the time interval\nbetween the maximum and the probable coming of an event. In this paper, we\nconsidered two types of events: the Olympic tennis tournament final in London,\n2012 and the prediction of Eurovision 2013 winner.", "published": "2013-10-13 18:17:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3499v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Can Twitter Predict Royal Baby's Name ?", "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the existence of possible correlation between\npublic opinion of twitter users and the decision-making of persons who are\ninfluential in the society. We carry out this analysis on the example of the\ndiscussion of probable name of the British crown baby, born in July, 2013. In\nour study, we use the methods of quantitative processing of natural language,\nthe theory of frequent sets, the algorithms of visual displaying of users'\ncommunities. We also analyzed the time dynamics of keyword frequencies. The\nanalysis showed that the main predictable name was dominating in the spectrum\nof names before the official announcement. Using the theories of frequent sets,\nwe showed that the full name consisting of three component names was the part\nof top 5 by the value of support. It was revealed that the structure of\ndynamically formed users' communities participating in the discussion is\ndetermined by only a few leaders who influence significantly the viewpoints of\nother users.", "published": "2013-10-13 18:22:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3500v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
