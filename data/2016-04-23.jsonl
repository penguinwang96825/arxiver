{"title": "Why and How to Pay Different Attention to Phrase Alignments of Different\n  Intensities", "abstract": "This work studies comparatively two typical sentence pair classification\ntasks: textual entailment (TE) and answer selection (AS), observing that phrase\nalignments of different intensities contribute differently in these tasks. We\naddress the problems of identifying phrase alignments of flexible granularity\nand pooling alignments of different intensities for these tasks. Examples for\nflexible granularity are alignments between two single words, between a single\nword and a phrase and between a short phrase and a long phrase. By intensity we\nroughly mean the degree of match, it ranges from identity over surface-form\nco-occurrence, rephrasing and other semantic relatedness to unrelated words as\nin lots of parenthesis text. Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase\ngeneration and representation, or (ii) conducts alignment at word and phrase\nlevels by handcrafted features or (iii) utilizes a single attention mechanism\nover alignment intensities without considering the characteristics of specific\ntasks, which limits the system's effectiveness across tasks. We propose an\narchitecture based on Gated Recurrent Unit that supports (i) representation\nlearning of phrases of arbitrary granularity and (ii) task-specific focusing of\nphrase alignments between two sentences by attention pooling. Experimental\nresults on TE and AS match our observation and are state-of-the-art.", "published": "2016-04-23 11:53:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06896v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Visualization of Jacques Lacan's Registers of the Psychoanalytic Field,\n  and Discovery of Metaphor and of Metonymy. Analytical Case Study of Edgar\n  Allan Poe's \"The Purloined Letter\"", "abstract": "We start with a description of Lacan's work that we then take into our\nanalytics methodology. In a first investigation, a Lacan-motivated template of\nthe Poe story is fitted to the data. A segmentation of the storyline is used in\norder to map out the diachrony. Based on this, it will be shown how synchronous\naspects, potentially related to Lacanian registers, can be sought. This\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of an approach based on a model template of the\nstoryline narrative. In a second and more comprehensive investigation, we\ndevelop an approach for revealing, that is, uncovering, Lacanian register\nrelationships. Objectives of this work include the wide and general application\nof our methodology. This methodology is strongly based on the \"letting the data\nspeak\" Correspondence Analysis analytics platform of Jean-Paul Benz\\'ecri, that\nis also the geometric data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative\nanalytics, developed by Pierre Bourdieu.", "published": "2016-04-23 20:48:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06952v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML", "62H25, 62H30", "I.5.3; I.5.4; I.2; G.2.2; G.3"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
