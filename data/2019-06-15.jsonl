{"title": "A formal approach for customization of schema.org based on SHACL", "abstract": "Schema.org is a widely adopted vocabulary for semantic annotation of content and data. However, its generic nature makes it complicated for data publishers to pick right types and properties for a specific domain and task. In this paper we propose a formal approach, a domain specification process that generates domain specific patterns by applying operators implemented in SHACL to the schema.org vocabulary. These patterns can support knowledge generation and assessment processes for specific domains and tasks. We demonstrated our approach with use cases in tourism domain.", "published": "2019-06-15 08:09:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06492v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.DB"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Relevance Feedback with Latent Variables in Riemann spaces", "abstract": "In this paper we develop and evaluate two methods for relevance feedback based on endowing a suitable \"semantic query space\" with a Riemann metric derived from the probability distribution of the positive samples of the feedback. The first method uses a Gaussian distribution to model the data, while the second uses a more complex Latent Semantic variable model. A mixed (discrete-continuous) version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed for this model.\n  We motivate the need for the semantic query space by analyzing in some depth three well-known relevance feedback methods, and we develop a new experimental methodology to evaluate these methods and compare their performance in a neutral way, that is, without making assumptions on the system in which they will be embedded.", "published": "2019-06-15 11:07:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06526v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.MM", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
