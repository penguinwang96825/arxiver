{"title": "Simplifying the Bible and Wikipedia Using Statistical Machine\n  Translation", "abstract": "I started this work with the hope of generating a text synthesizer (like a\nmusical synthesizer) that can imitate certain linguistic styles. Most of the\nreport focuses on text simplification using statistical machine translation\n(SMT) techniques. I applied MOSES to a parallel corpus of the Bible (King James\nVersion and Easy-to-Read Version) and that of Wikipedia articles (normal and\nsimplified). I report the importance of the three main components of\nSMT---phrase translation, language model, and recording---by changing their\nweights and comparing the resulting quality of simplified text in terms of\nMETEOR and BLEU. Toward the end of the report will be presented some examples\nof text \"synthesized\" into the King James style.", "published": "2017-03-25 04:25:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08646v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Morphological Analysis for the Maltese Language: The Challenges of a\n  Hybrid System", "abstract": "Maltese is a morphologically rich language with a hybrid morphological system\nwhich features both concatenative and non-concatenative processes. This paper\nanalyses the impact of this hybridity on the performance of machine learning\ntechniques for morphological labelling and clustering. In particular, we\nanalyse a dataset of morphologically related word clusters to evaluate the\ndifference in results for concatenative and nonconcatenative clusters. We also\ndescribe research carried out in morphological labelling, with a particular\nfocus on the verb category. Two evaluations were carried out, one using an\nunseen dataset, and another one using a gold standard dataset which was\nmanually labelled. The gold standard dataset was split into concatenative and\nnon-concatenative to analyse the difference in results between the two\nmorphological systems.", "published": "2017-03-25 14:56:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08701v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Comparing Rule-Based and Deep Learning Models for Patient Phenotyping", "abstract": "Objective: We investigate whether deep learning techniques for natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) can be used efficiently for patient phenotyping.\nPatient phenotyping is a classification task for determining whether a patient\nhas a medical condition, and is a crucial part of secondary analysis of\nhealthcare data. We assess the performance of deep learning algorithms and\ncompare them with classical NLP approaches.\n  Materials and Methods: We compare convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nn-gram models, and approaches based on cTAKES that extract pre-defined medical\nconcepts from clinical notes and use them to predict patient phenotypes. The\nperformance is tested on 10 different phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge\nsummaries extracted from the MIMIC-III database.\n  Results: CNNs outperform other phenotyping algorithms in all 10 tasks. The\naverage F1-score of our model is 76 (PPV of 83, and sensitivity of 71) with our\nmodel having an F1-score up to 37 points higher than alternative approaches. We\nadditionally assess the interpretability of our model by presenting a method\nthat extracts the most salient phrases for a particular prediction.\n  Conclusion: We show that NLP methods based on deep learning improve the\nperformance of patient phenotyping. Our CNN-based algorithm automatically\nlearns the phrases associated with each patient phenotype. As such, it reduces\nthe annotation complexity for clinical domain experts, who are normally\nrequired to develop task-specific annotation rules and identify relevant\nphrases. Our method performs well in terms of both performance and\ninterpretability, which indicates that deep learning is an effective approach\nto patient phenotyping based on clinicians' notes.", "published": "2017-03-25 15:37:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08705v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
