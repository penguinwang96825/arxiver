This paper addresses the problem of distilling word embeddings for NLP\ntasks. We propose an encoding approach to distill task-specific knowledge from\na set of high-dimensional embeddings, which can reduce model complexity by a\nlarge margin as well as retain high accuracy, showing a good compromise between\nefficiency and performance. Experiments in two tasks reveal the phenomenon that\ndistilling knowledge from cumbersome embeddings is better than directly\ntraining neural networks with small embeddings.", "published": "2015-06-15 06:30:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04488v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal: A Case Study on an Online Strategy\n  Game", "abstract": "Interpersonal relations are fickle, with close friendships often dissolving\ninto enmity. In this work, we explore linguistic cues that presage such\ntransitions by studying dyadic interactions in an online strategy game where\nplayers form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal. We\ncharacterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal\npatterns that foretell betrayal.\n  We reveal that subtle signs of imminent betrayal are encoded in the\nconversational patterns of the dyad, even if the victim is not aware of the\nrelationship's fate. In particular, we find that lasting friendships exhibit a\nform of balance that manifests itself through language. In contrast, sudden\nchanges in the balance of certain conversational attributes---such as positive\nsentiment, politeness, or focus on future planning---signal impending betrayal.", "published": "2015-06-15 20:00:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04744v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
