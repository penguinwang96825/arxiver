{"title": "Adversarial Impacts on Autonomous Decentralized Lightweight Swarms", "abstract": "The decreased size and cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) has enabled the use of swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles to accomplish a variety of tasks. By utilizing swarming behaviors, it is possible to efficiently accomplish coordinated tasks while minimizing per-drone computational requirements. Some drones rely on decentralized protocols that exhibit emergent behavior across the swarm. While fully decentralized algorithms remove obvious attack vectors their susceptibility to external influence is less understood. This work investigates the influences that can compromise the functionality of an autonomous swarm leading to hazardous situations and cascading vulnerabilities. When a swarm is tasked with missions involving the safety or health of humans, external influences could have serious consequences. The adversarial swarm in this work utilizes an attack vector embedded within the decentralized movement algorithm of a previously defined autonomous swarm designed to create a perimeter sentry swarm. Various simulations confirm the adversarial swarm's ability to capture significant portions (6-23%) of the perimeter.", "published": "2020-02-21 03:31:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09109v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
