{"title": "Effects of Word-frequency based Pre- and Post- Processings for Audio Captioning", "abstract": "The system we used for Task 6 (Automated Audio Captioning)of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events(DCASE) 2020 Challenge combines three elements, namely, dataaugmentation, multi-task learning, and post-processing, for audiocaptioning. The system received the highest evaluation scores, butwhich of the individual elements most fully contributed to its perfor-mance has not yet been clarified. Here, to asses their contributions,we first conducted an element-wise ablation study on our systemto estimate to what extent each element is effective. We then con-ducted a detailed module-wise ablation study to further clarify thekey processing modules for improving accuracy. The results showthat data augmentation and post-processing significantly improvethe score in our system. In particular, mix-up data augmentationand beam search in post-processing improve SPIDEr by 0.8 and 1.6points, respectively.", "published": "2020-09-24 01:07:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11436v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "A New Dataset for Amateur Vocal Percussion Analysis", "abstract": "The imitation of percussive instruments via the human voice is a natural way for us to communicate rhythmic ideas and, for this reason, it attracts the interest of music makers. Specifically, the automatic mapping of these vocal imitations to their emulated instruments would allow creators to realistically prototype rhythms in a faster way. The contribution of this study is two-fold. Firstly, a new Amateur Vocal Percussion (AVP) dataset is introduced to investigate how people with little or no experience in beatboxing approach the task of vocal percussion. The end-goal of this analysis is that of helping mapping algorithms to better generalise between subjects and achieve higher performances. The dataset comprises a total of 9780 utterances recorded by 28 participants with fully annotated onsets and labels (kick drum, snare drum, closed hi-hat and opened hi-hat). Lastly, we conducted baseline experiments on audio onset detection with the recorded dataset, comparing the performance of four state-of-the-art algorithms in a vocal percussion context.", "published": "2020-09-24 14:57:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11737v1", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
