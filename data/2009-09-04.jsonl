{"title": "A Monte Carlo AIXI Approximation", "abstract": "This paper introduces a principled approach for the design of a scalable general reinforcement learning agent. Our approach is based on a direct approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a new Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension to the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a variety of stochastic and partially observable domains. We conclude by proposing a number of directions for future research.", "published": "2009-09-04 03:13:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0801v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.IT", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Ternary Codes Associated with O^-(2n,q) and Power Moments of Kloosterman Sums with Square Arguments", "abstract": "In this paper, we construct three ternary linear codes associated with the orthogonal group O^-(2,q) and the special orthogonal groups SO^-(2,q) and SO^-(4,q). Here q is a power of three. Then we obtain recursive formulas for the power moments of Kloosterman sums with square arguments and for the even power moments of those in terms of the frequencies of weights in the codes. This is done via Pless power moment identity and by utilizing the explicit expressions of \"Gauss sums\" for the orthogonal and special orthogonal groups O^-(2n,q) and SO^-(2n,q).", "published": "2009-09-04 05:18:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0811v1", "categories": ["math.NT", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "math.NT"}
