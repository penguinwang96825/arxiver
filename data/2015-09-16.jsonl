{"title": "amLite: Amharic Transliteration Using Key Map Dictionary", "abstract": "amLite is a framework developed to map ASCII transliterated Amharic texts\nback to the original Amharic letter texts. The aim of such a framework is to\nmake existing Amharic linguistic data consistent and interoperable among\nresearchers. For achieving the objective, a key map dictionary is constructed\nusing the possible ASCII combinations actively in use for transliterating\nAmharic letters; and a mapping of the combinations to the corresponding Amharic\nletters is done. The mapping is then used to replace the Amharic linguistic\ntext back to form the original Amharic letters text. The framework indicated\n97.7, 99.7 and 98.4 percentage accuracy on converting the three sample random\ntest data. It is; however, possible to improve the accuracy of the framework by\nadding an exception to the implementation of the algorithm, or by preprocessing\nthe input text prior to conversion. This paper outlined the rationales behind\nthe need for developing the framework and the processes undertaken in the\ndevelopment.", "published": "2015-09-16 05:00:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04811v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
