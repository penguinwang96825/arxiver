{"title": "Neural Operators Can Play Dynamic Stackelberg Games", "abstract": "Dynamic Stackelberg games are a broad class of two-player games in which the\nleader acts first, and the follower chooses a response strategy to the leader's\nstrategy. Unfortunately, only stylized Stackelberg games are explicitly\nsolvable since the follower's best-response operator (as a function of the\ncontrol of the leader) is typically analytically intractable. This paper\naddresses this issue by showing that the \\textit{follower's best-response\noperator} can be approximately implemented by an \\textit{attention-based neural\noperator}, uniformly on compact subsets of adapted open-loop controls for the\nleader. We further show that the value of the Stackelberg game where the\nfollower uses the approximate best-response operator approximates the value of\nthe original Stackelberg game. Our main result is obtained using our universal\napproximation theorem for attention-based neural operators between spaces of\nsquare-integrable adapted stochastic processes, as well as stability results\nfor a general class of Stackelberg games.", "published": "2024-11-14 18:12:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09644v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.LG", "cs.NA", "math.NA", "math.PR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
