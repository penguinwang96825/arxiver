{"title": "Evaluation of YTEX and MetaMap for clinical concept recognition", "abstract": "We used MetaMap and YTEX as a basis for the construc- tion of two separate\nsystems to participate in the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Task 1[9], the\nrecognition of clinical concepts. No modifications were directly made to these\nsystems, but output concepts were filtered using stop concepts, stop concept\ntext and UMLS semantic type. Con- cept boundaries were also adjusted using a\nsmall collection of rules to increase precision on the strict task. Overall\nMetaMap had better per- formance than YTEX on the strict task, primarily due to\na 20% perfor- mance improvement in precision. In the relaxed task YTEX had\nbetter performance in both precision and recall giving it an overall F-Score\n4.6% higher than MetaMap on the test data. Our results also indicated a 1.3%\nhigher accuracy for YTEX in UMLS CUI mapping.", "published": "2014-02-07 15:33:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1668v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "68"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
