{"title": "Restricted CSPs and F-free Digraph Algorithmics", "abstract": "In recent years, much attention has been placed on the complexity of graph\nhomomorphism problems when the input is restricted to ${\\mathbb P}_k$-free and\n${\\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free graphs. We consider the directed version of this\nresearch line, by addressing the questions, is it true that digraph\nhomomorphism problems CSP$({\\mathbb H})$ have a P versus NP-complete dichotomy\nwhen the input is restricted to $\\vec{\\mathbb P}_k$-free (resp.\\ $\\vec{\\mathbb\nP}_k$-subgraph-free) digraphs? Our main contribution in this direction shows\nthat if CSP$({\\mathbb H})$ is NP-complete, then there is a positive integer $N$\nsuch that CSP$({\\mathbb H})$ remains NP-hard even for $\\vec{\\mathbb\nP}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs. Moreover, it remains NP-hard for acyclic\n$\\vec{\\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs, and becomes polynomial-time\nsolvable for $\\vec{\\mathbb P}_{N-1}$-subgraph-free acyclic digraphs. We then\nverify the questions above for digraphs on three vertices and a family of\nsmooth tournaments. We prove these results by establishing a connection between\n$\\mathbb F$-(subgraph)-free algorithmics and constraint satisfaction theory. On\nthe way, we introduce restricted CSPs, i.e., problems of the form CSP$({\\mathbb\nH})$ restricted to yes-instances of CSP$({\\mathbb H}')$ -- these were called\nrestricted homomorphism problems by Hell and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il. Another main\nresult of this paper presents a P versus NP-complete dichotomy for these\nproblems. Moreover, this complexity dichotomy is accompanied by an algebraic\ndichotomy in the spirit of the finite domain CSP dichotomy.", "published": "2025-02-24 19:27:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17596v1", "categories": ["cs.CC", "cs.DM", "cs.LO", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.CC"}
{"title": "Optimal placement of mobile distance-limited devices for line routing\\", "abstract": "A segment (barrier) is specified on the plane, as well as depots, where the\nmobile devices (drones) can be placed. Each drone departs from its depot to the\nbarrier, moves along the barrier and returns to its depot, traveling a path of\na limited length. The part of the barrier along which the drone moved is\n\\emph{covered} by this sensor. It is required to place a limited quantity of\ndrones in the depots and determine the trajectory of each drone in such a way\nthat the barrier is covered, and the total length of the paths traveled by the\ndrones is minimal.\n  Previously, this problem was considered for an unlimited number of drones. If\neach drone covers a segment of length at least 1, then the time complexity of\nthe proposed algorithm was $O(mL^3)$, where $m$ is the number of depots and $L$\nis the length of the barrier. In this paper, we generalize the problem by\nintroducing an upper bound $n$ on the number of drones, and propose a new\nalgorithm with time complexity equals $O(mnL^2)$. Since each drone covers a\nsegment of length at least 1, then $n\\leq L$ and $O(mnL^2)\\leq O(mL^3)$.\nAssuming an unlimited number of drones, as investigated in our prior work, we\npresent an $O(mL^2)$-time algorithm, achieving an $L$-fold reduction compared\nto previous methods. Here, the algorithm has a time complexity that equals\n$O(L^2)$, and the most time-consuming is preprocessing.", "published": "2025-02-24 05:03:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16844v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Event-Based Limit Order Book Simulation under a Neural Hawkes Process: Application in Market-Making", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an event-driven Limit Order Book (LOB) model that\ncaptures twelve of the most observed LOB events in exchange-based financial\nmarkets. To model these events, we propose using the state-of-the-art Neural\nHawkes process, a more robust alternative to traditional Hawkes process models.\nMore specifically, this model captures the dynamic relationships between\ndifferent event types, particularly their long- and short-term interactions,\nusing a Long Short-Term Memory neural network. Using this framework, we\nconstruct a midprice process that captures the event-driven behavior of the LOB\nby simulating high-frequency dynamics like how they appear in real financial\nmarkets. The empirical results show that our model captures many of the broader\ncharacteristics of the price fluctuations, particularly in terms of their\noverall volatility. We apply this LOB simulation model within a Deep\nReinforcement Learning Market-Making framework, where the trading agent can now\ncomplete trade order fills in a manner that closely resembles real-market trade\nexecution. Here, we also compare the results of the simulated model with those\nfrom real data, highlighting how the overall performance and the distribution\nof trade order fills closely align with the same analysis on real data.", "published": "2025-02-24 18:50:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17417v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Decoding Financial Health in Kenyas' Medical Insurance Sector: A Data-Driven Cluster Analysis", "abstract": "This study examines insurance companies' financial performance and reporting\ntrends within the medical sector using advanced clustering techniques to\nidentify distinct patterns. Four clusters were identified by analyzing\nfinancial ratios and time series data, each representing unique financial\nperformance and reporting consistency combinations. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nand KMeans clustering were employed to capture temporal variations and uncover\nkey insights into company behaviors. The findings reveal that resilient\nperformers consistently report and have financial stability, making them\nreliable options for policyholders. In contrast, clusters of underperforming\ncompanies and those with reporting gaps highlight operational challenges and\nissues related to data consistency. These insights emphasize the importance of\ntransparency and timely reporting to ensure the sector's resilience. This study\ncontributes to the literature by integrating time series analysis into\nfinancial clustering, offering practical recommendations for improving data\ngovernance and financial stability in the insurance sector. Future research\ncould further investigate non-financial indicators and explore alternative\nclustering methods to provide a deeper understanding of performance dynamics.", "published": "2025-02-24 11:36:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17072v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Predicting Liquidity-Aware Bond Yields using Causal GANs and Deep Reinforcement Learning with LLM Evaluation", "abstract": "Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity,\nnonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative\nAdversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four\nmajor bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key\nmacroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential\nmarket properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into\nactionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM)\nQwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments,\nand volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of\nwhich demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over\nexisting methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE\nevaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation\n(3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement\nlearning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute\nError of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond\nmarket dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also\nprovides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk &\nvolatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a\nbridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and\nlanguage model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.", "published": "2025-02-24 09:46:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17011v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CE", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

{"title": "A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk", "abstract": "Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for\nfinancial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production\nnetworks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of\nothers and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of\nthe economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates\ninto financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion\nleads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial\nstress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that\nfeatures a national firm level supply chain network in combination with\ninterbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set\nincluding about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm\nloans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we\nimplement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows\nus to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to\ninterbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this\namplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these\ncontagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when\nproduction network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic\nrisk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of\nthe interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic\nrisk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of\nthe real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven\nunderstanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and\nfinancial systems.", "published": "2025-02-24 10:52:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
