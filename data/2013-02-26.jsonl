{"title": "Non-simplifying Graph Rewriting Termination", "abstract": "So far, a very large amount of work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) rely\non trees as the core mathematical structure to represent linguistic\ninformations (e.g. in Chomsky's work). However, some linguistic phenomena do\nnot cope properly with trees. In a former paper, we showed the benefit of\nencoding linguistic structures by graphs and of using graph rewriting rules to\ncompute on those structures. Justified by some linguistic considerations, graph\nrewriting is characterized by two features: first, there is no node creation\nalong computations and second, there are non-local edge modifications. Under\nthese hypotheses, we show that uniform termination is undecidable and that\nnon-uniform termination is decidable. We describe two termination techniques\nbased on weights and we give complexity bound on the derivation length for\nthese rewriting system.", "published": "2013-02-26 06:50:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6334v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CC", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
