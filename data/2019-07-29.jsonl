{"title": "Algorithmic market making for options", "abstract": "In this article, we tackle the problem of a market maker in charge of a book of options on a single liquid underlying asset. By using an approximation of the portfolio in terms of its vega, we show that the seemingly high-dimensional stochastic optimal control problem of an option market maker is in fact tractable. More precisely, when volatility is modeled using a classical stochastic volatility model -- e.g. the Heston model -- the problem faced by an option market maker is characterized by a low-dimensional functional equation that can be solved numerically using a Euler scheme along with interpolation techniques, even for large portfolios. In order to illustrate our findings, numerical examples are provided.", "published": "2019-07-29 13:53:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12433v7", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
