{"title": "Investigating the influence Brexit had on Financial Markets, in particular the GBP/EUR exchange rate", "abstract": "On 23rd June 2016, 51.9% of British voters voted to leave the European Union, triggering a process and events that have led to the United Kingdom leaving the EU, an event that has become known as 'Brexit'. In this piece of research, we investigate the effects of this entire process on the currency markets, specifically the GBP/EUR exchange rate. Financial markets are known to be sensitive to news articles and media, and the aim of this research is to evaluate the magnitude of impact of relevant events, as well as whether the impact was positive or negative for the GBP.", "published": "2020-03-03 22:05:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05895v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Towards Real-time Mispronunciation Detection in Kids' Speech", "abstract": "Modern mispronunciation detection and diagnosis systems have seen significant gains in accuracy due to the introduction of deep learning. However, these systems have not been evaluated for the ability to be run in real-time, an important factor in applications that provide rapid feedback. In particular, the state-of-the-art uses bi-directional recurrent networks, where a uni-directional network may be more appropriate. Teacher-student learning is a natural approach to use to improve a uni-directional model, but when using a CTC objective, this is limited by poor alignment of outputs to evidence. We address this limitation by trying two loss terms for improving the alignments of our models. One loss is an \"alignment loss\" term that encourages outputs only when features do not resemble silence. The other loss term uses a uni-directional model as teacher model to align the bi-directional model. Our proposed model uses these aligned bi-directional models as teacher models. Experiments on the CSLU kids' corpus show that these changes decrease the latency of the outputs, and improve the detection rates, with a trade-off between these goals.", "published": "2020-03-03 19:58:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01765v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Discover Your Social Identity from What You Tweet: a Content Based Approach", "abstract": "An identity denotes the role an individual or a group plays in highly differentiated contemporary societies. In this paper, our goal is to classify Twitter users based on their role identities. We first collect a coarse-grained public figure dataset automatically, then manually label a more fine-grained identity dataset. We propose a hierarchical self-attention neural network for Twitter user role identity classification. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms multiple baselines. We further propose a transfer learning scheme that improves our model's performance by a large margin. Such transfer learning also greatly reduces the need for a large amount of human labeled data.", "published": "2020-03-03 21:13:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01797v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
