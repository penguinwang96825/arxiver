{"title": "Method of Moments Estimation for Affine Stochastic Volatility Models", "abstract": "We develop moment estimators for the parameters of affine stochastic\nvolatility models. We first address the challenge of calculating moments for\nthe models by introducing a recursive equation for deriving closed-form\nexpressions for moments of any order. Consequently, we propose our moment\nestimators. We then establish a central limit theorem for our estimators and\nderive the explicit formulas for the asymptotic covariance matrix. Finally, we\nprovide numerical results to validate our method.", "published": "2024-08-17 12:29:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09185v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "econ.EM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
