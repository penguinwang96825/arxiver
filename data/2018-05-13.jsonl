{"title": "General solutions for nonlinear differential equations: a rule-based self-learning approach using deep reinforcement learning", "abstract": "A universal rule-based self-learning approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for the first time to solve nonlinear ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. The solver consists of a deep neural network-structured actor that outputs candidate solutions, and a critic derived only from physical rules (governing equations and boundary and initial conditions). Solutions in discretized time are treated as multiple tasks sharing the same governing equation, and the current step parameters provide an ideal initialization for the next owing to the temporal continuity of the solutions, which shows a transfer learning characteristic and indicates that the DRL solver has captured the intrinsic nature of the equation. The approach is verified through solving the Schr\u00f6dinger, Navier-Stokes, Burgers', Van der Pol, and Lorenz equations and an equation of motion. The results indicate that the approach gives solutions with high accuracy, and the solution process promises to get faster.", "published": "2018-05-13 15:16:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07297v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "math.NA", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Lehmer Transform and its Theoretical Properties", "abstract": "We propose a new class of transforms that we call {\\it Lehmer Transform} which is motivated by the {\\it Lehmer mean function}. The proposed {\\it Lehmer transform} decomposes a function of a sample into their constituting statistical moments. Theoretical properties of the proposed transform are presented. This transform could be very useful to provide an alternative method in analyzing non-stationary signals such as brain wave EEG.", "published": "2018-05-13 19:04:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04927v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
