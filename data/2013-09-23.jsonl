{"title": "Sentiment Analysis: How to Derive Prior Polarities from SentiWordNet", "abstract": "Assigning a positive or negative score to a word out of context (i.e. a\nword's prior polarity) is a challenging task for sentiment analysis. In the\nliterature, various approaches based on SentiWordNet have been proposed. In\nthis paper, we compare the most often used techniques together with newly\nproposed ones and incorporate all of them in a learning framework to see\nwhether blending them can further improve the estimation of prior polarity\nscores. Using two different versions of SentiWordNet and testing regression and\nclassification models across tasks and datasets, our learning approach\nconsistently outperforms the single metrics, providing a new state-of-the-art\napproach in computing words' prior polarity for sentiment analysis. We conclude\nour investigation showing interesting biases in calculated prior polarity\nscores when word Part of Speech and annotator gender are considered.", "published": "2013-09-23 15:26:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5843v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "From Once Upon a Time to Happily Ever After: Tracking Emotions in Novels\n  and Fairy Tales", "abstract": "Today we have access to unprecedented amounts of literary texts. However,\nsearch still relies heavily on key words. In this paper, we show how sentiment\nanalysis can be used in tandem with effective visualizations to quantify and\ntrack emotions in both individual books and across very large collections. We\nintroduce the concept of emotion word density, and using the Brothers Grimm\nfairy tales as example, we show how collections of text can be organized for\nbetter search. Using the Google Books Corpus we show how to determine an\nentity's emotion associations from co-occurring words. Finally, we compare\nemotion words in fairy tales and novels, to show that fairy tales have a much\nwider range of emotion word densities than novels.", "published": "2013-09-23 18:43:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5909v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Feature Learning with Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Robust\n  Speech Recognition", "abstract": "In this paper, we first present a new variant of Gaussian restricted\nBoltzmann machine (GRBM) called multivariate Gaussian restricted Boltzmann\nmachine (MGRBM), with its definition and learning algorithm. Then we propose\nusing a learned GRBM or MGRBM to extract better features for robust speech\nrecognition. Our experiments on Aurora2 show that both GRBM-extracted and\nMGRBM-extracted feature performs much better than Mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefficient (MFCC) with either HMM-GMM or hybrid HMM-deep neural network (DNN)\nacoustic model, and MGRBM-extracted feature is slightly better.", "published": "2013-09-23 13:51:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6176v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
