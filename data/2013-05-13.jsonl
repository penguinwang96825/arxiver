{"title": "A study for the effect of the Emphaticness and language and dialect for\n  Voice Onset Time (VOT) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)", "abstract": "The signal sound contains many different features, including Voice Onset Time\n(VOT), which is a very important feature of stop sounds in many languages. The\nonly application of VOT values is stopping phoneme subsets. This subset of\nconsonant sounds is stop phonemes exist in the Arabic language, and in fact,\nall languages. The pronunciation of these sounds is hard and unique especially\nfor less-educated Arabs and non-native Arabic speakers. VOT can be utilized by\nthe human auditory system to distinguish between voiced and unvoiced stops such\nas /p/ and /b/ in English.This search focuses on computing and analyzing VOT of\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA), within the Arabic language, for all pairs of\nnon-emphatic (namely, /d/ and /t/) and emphatic pairs (namely, /d?/ and /t?/)\ndepending on carrier words. This research uses a database built by ourselves,\nand uses the carrier words syllable structure: CV-CV-CV. One of the main\noutcomes always found is the emphatic sounds (/d?/, /t?/) are less than 50% of\nnon-emphatic (counter-part) sounds ( /d/, /t/).Also, VOT can be used to\nclassify or detect for a dialect ina language.", "published": "2013-05-13 06:38:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2680v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
