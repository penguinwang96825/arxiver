{"title": "Compact packings of the plane with three sizes of discs", "abstract": "A compact packing is a set of non-overlapping discs where all the holes between discs are curvilinear triangles. There is only one compact packing by discs of size $1$. There are exactly $9$ values of $r$ which allow a compact packing by discs of sizes $1$ and $r$. We prove here that there are exactly $164$ pairs $(r,s)$ allowing a compact packing by discs of sizes $1$, $r$ and $s$.", "published": "2018-09-26 07:46:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02231v4", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
