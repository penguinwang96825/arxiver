{"title": "Joint Modeling of Content and Discourse Relations in Dialogues", "abstract": "We present a joint modeling approach to identify salient discussion points in\nspoken meetings as well as to label the discourse relations between speaker\nturns. A variation of our model is also discussed when discourse relations are\ntreated as latent variables. Experimental results on two popular meeting\ncorpora show that our joint model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches\nfor both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction\ntasks. We also evaluate our model on predicting the consistency among team\nmembers' understanding of their group decisions. Classifiers trained with\nfeatures constructed from our model achieve significant better predictive\nperformance than the state-of-the-art.", "published": "2017-05-14 23:45:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05039v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
