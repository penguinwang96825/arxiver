{"title": "Improving the Quality of MT Output using Novel Name Entity Translation\n  Scheme", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to machine translation by combining the\nstate of art name entity translation scheme. Improper translation of name\nentities lapse the quality of machine translated output. In this work, name\nentities are transliterated by using statistical rule based approach. This\npaper describes the translation and transliteration of name entities from\nEnglish to Punjabi. We have experimented on four types of name entities which\nare: Proper names, Location names, Organization names and miscellaneous.\nVarious rules for the purpose of syllabification have been constructed.\nTransliteration of name entities is accomplished with the help of Probability\ncalculation. N-Gram probabilities for the extracted syllables have been\ncalculated using statistical machine translation toolkit MOSES.", "published": "2013-10-02 05:58:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0573v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Development of Marathi Part of Speech Tagger Using Statistical Approach", "abstract": "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a process of assigning the words in a text\ncorresponding to a particular part of speech. A fundamental version of POS\ntagging is the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. For\nprocessing natural languages, Part of Speech tagging is a prominent tool. It is\none of the simplest as well as most constant and statistical model for many NLP\napplications. POS Tagging is an initial stage of linguistics, text analysis\nlike information retrieval, machine translator, text to speech synthesis,\ninformation extraction etc. In POS Tagging we assign a Part of Speech tag to\neach word in a sentence and literature. Various approaches have been proposed\nto implement POS taggers. In this paper we present a Marathi part of speech\ntagger. It is morphologically rich language. Marathi is spoken by the native\npeople of Maharashtra. The general approach used for development of tagger is\nstatistical using Unigram, Bigram, Trigram and HMM Methods. It presents a clear\nidea about all the algorithms with suitable examples. It also introduces a tag\nset for Marathi which can be used for tagging Marathi text. In this paper we\nhave shown the development of the tagger as well as compared to check the\naccuracy of taggers output. The three Marathi POS taggers viz. Unigram, Bigram,\nTrigram and HMM gives the accuracy of 77.38%, 90.30%, 91.46% and 93.82%\nrespectively.", "published": "2013-10-02 06:04:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0575v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Subjective and Objective Evaluation of English to Urdu Machine\n  Translation", "abstract": "Machine translation is research based area where evaluation is very important\nphenomenon for checking the quality of MT output. The work is based on the\nevaluation of English to Urdu Machine translation. In this research work we\nhave evaluated the translation quality of Urdu language which has been\ntranslated by using different Machine Translation systems like Google, Babylon\nand Ijunoon. The evaluation process is done by using two approaches - Human\nevaluation and Automatic evaluation. We have worked for both the approaches\nwhere in human evaluation emphasis is given to scales and parameters while in\nautomatic evaluation emphasis is given to some automatic metric such as BLEU,\nGTM, METEOR and ATEC.", "published": "2013-10-02 06:10:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0578v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Rule Based Stemmer in Urdu", "abstract": "Urdu is a combination of several languages like Arabic, Hindi, English,\nTurkish, Sanskrit etc. It has a complex and rich morphology. This is the reason\nwhy not much work has been done in Urdu language processing. Stemming is used\nto convert a word into its respective root form. In stemming, we separate the\nsuffix and prefix from the word. It is useful in search engines, natural\nlanguage processing and word processing, spell checkers, word parsing, word\nfrequency and count studies. This paper presents a rule based stemmer for Urdu.\nThe stemmer that we have discussed here is used in information retrieval. We\nhave also evaluated our results by verifying it with a human expert.", "published": "2013-10-02 06:15:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0581v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Stemmers for Tamil Language: Performance Analysis", "abstract": "Stemming is the process of extracting root word from the given inflection\nword and also plays significant role in numerous application of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP).
