{"title": "The placement of the head that minimizes online memory: a complex\n  systems approach", "abstract": "It is well known that the length of a syntactic dependency determines its\nonline memory cost. Thus, the problem of the placement of a head and its\ndependents (complements or modifiers) that minimizes online memory is\nequivalent to the problem of the minimum linear arrangement of a star tree.\nHowever, how that length is translated into cognitive cost is not known. This\nstudy shows that the online memory cost is minimized when the head is placed at\nthe center, regardless of the function that transforms length into cost,\nprovided only that this function is strictly monotonically increasing. Online\nmemory defines a quasi-convex adaptive landscape with a single central minimum\nif the number of elements is odd and two central minima if that number is even.\nWe discuss various aspects of the dynamics of word order of subject (S), verb\n(V) and object (O) from a complex systems perspective and suggest that word\norders tend to evolve by swapping adjacent constituents from an initial or\nearly SOV configuration that is attracted towards a central word order by\nonline memory minimization. We also suggest that the stability of SVO is due to\nat least two factors, the quasi-convex shape of the adaptive landscape in the\nonline memory dimension and online memory adaptations that avoid regression to\nSOV. Although OVS is also optimal for placing the verb at the center, its low\nfrequency is explained by its long distance to the seminal SOV in the\npermutation space.", "published": "2013-09-08 08:31:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1939v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "nlin.AO", "physics.data-an", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
