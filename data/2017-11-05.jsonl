{"title": "Learning Word Embeddings from Speech", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture,\nSequence-to-Sequence Audio2Vec, for unsupervised learning of fixed-length\nvector representations of audio segments excised from a speech corpus, where\nthe vectors contain semantic information pertaining to the segments, and are\nclose to other vectors in the embedding space if their corresponding segments\nare semantically similar. The design of the proposed model is based on the RNN\nEncoder-Decoder framework, and borrows the methodology of continuous skip-grams\nfor training. The learned vector representations are evaluated on 13 widely\nused word similarity benchmarks, and achieved competitive results to that of\nGloVe. The biggest advantage of the proposed model is its capability of\nextracting semantic information of audio segments taken directly from raw\nspeech, without relying on any other modalities such as text or images, which\nare challenging and expensive to collect and annotate.", "published": "2017-11-05 01:36:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01515v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multi-label Dataless Text Classification with Topic Modeling", "abstract": "Manually labeling documents is tedious and expensive, but it is essential for\ntraining a traditional text classifier. In recent years, a few dataless text\nclassification techniques have been proposed to address this problem. However,\nexisting works mainly center on single-label classification problems, that is,\neach document is restricted to belonging to a single category. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Seed-guided Multi-label Topic Model, named SMTM. With a few\nseed words relevant to each category, SMTM conducts multi-label classification\nfor a collection of documents without any labeled document. In SMTM, each\ncategory is associated with a single category-topic which covers the meaning of\nthe category. To accommodate with multi-labeled documents, we explicitly model\nthe category sparsity in SMTM by using spike and slab prior and weak smoothing\nprior. That is, without using any threshold tuning, SMTM automatically selects\nthe relevant categories for each document. To incorporate the supervision of\nthe seed words, we propose a seed-guided biased GPU (i.e., generalized Polya\nurn) sampling procedure to guide the topic inference of SMTM. Experiments on\ntwo public datasets show that SMTM achieves better classification accuracy than\nstate-of-the-art alternatives and even outperforms supervised solutions in some\nscenarios.", "published": "2017-11-05 11:34:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01563v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Robust Speech Recognition Using Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "This paper describes a general, scalable, end-to-end framework that uses the\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) objective to enable robust speech\nrecognition. Encoders trained with the proposed approach enjoy improved\ninvariance by learning to map noisy audio to the same embedding space as that\nof clean audio. Unlike previous methods, the new framework does not rely on\ndomain expertise or simplifying assumptions as are often needed in signal\nprocessing, and directly encourages robustness in a data-driven way. We show\nthe new approach improves simulated far-field speech recognition of vanilla\nsequence-to-sequence models without specialized front-ends or preprocessing.", "published": "2017-11-05 12:00:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01567v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Robust Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for DOA Estimation of Acoustic\n  Sources in the Spherical Harmonic Domain", "abstract": "The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of sound sources has been a popular\nsignal processing research topic due to its widespread applications. Using\nspherical microphone arrays (SMA), DOA estimation can be applied in the\nspherical harmonic (SH) domain without any spatial ambiguity. However, the\nenvironment reverberation and noise can degrade the estimation performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a new expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for\ndeterministic maximum likelihood (ML) DOA estimation of L sound sources in the\npresence of spatially nonuniform noise in the SH domain. Furthermore a new\nclosed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the deterministic ML DOA estimation is\nderived for the signal model in the SH domain. The main idea of the proposed\nalgorithm is considering the general model of the received signal in the SH\ndomain, we reduce the complexity of the ML estimation by breaking it down into\ntwo steps: expectation and maximization steps. The proposed algorithm reduces\nthe complexity from 2L-dimensional space to L 2-dimensional space. Simulation\nresults indicate that the proposed algorithm shows at least an improvement of\n6dB in robustness in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). Moreover, the RMSE\nof the proposed algorithm is very close to the CRB compared to the recent\nmethods in reverberant and noisy environments in the large range of signal to\nnoise ratio.", "published": "2017-11-05 13:25:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01583v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
