{"title": "Data Efficacy for Language Model Training", "abstract": "Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement.

Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the\nfailure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due\nto the underlying LM not representing this concept.

To address these limitations, we introduce a\nmodification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK\nactivation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states\nequivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods.

{"title": "Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?", "abstract": "There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language\nmodel (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via\nfine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model\nchanges. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more\neffective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and\ndraw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can\nmodels be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper\ndescribes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the\neffects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from\ngradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as\ntargets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient\ndescent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model\nperformance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and\nanswering questions about text passages after a single gradient update.

We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement\non diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely\ndependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,\nenabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and\ntest.

However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive\nprocess, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and\nafter perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and\nunperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt\nto forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent\nrelationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In\nthis work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges\n(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively\naddressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework\nas a form of data augmentation.

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge.

Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual\ncues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,\ncollecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.\nThis paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER\n(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher\nmodels built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers\nknowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher\nmodels to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark\ndatasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence\non extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.", "published": "2025-06-26 04:13:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00055v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.HC", "cs.MM", "eess.AS", "eess.IV", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
