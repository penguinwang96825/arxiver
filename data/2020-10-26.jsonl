{"title": "Designing learning experiences for online teaching and learning", "abstract": "Teaching is about constantly innovating strategies, ways and means to engage diverse students in active and meaningful learning. In line with this, SUTD adopts various student-centric teaching and learning teaching methods and approaches. This means that our graduate/undergraduate instructors have to be ready to teach using these student student-centric teaching and learning pedagogies. In this article, I share my experiences of redesigning this teaching course that is typically conducted face-to-face to a synchronous online course and also invite one of the participant in this course to reflect on his experience as a student.", "published": "2020-10-26 07:03:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15602v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Improving pronunciation assessment via ordinal regression with anchored reference samples", "abstract": "Sentence level pronunciation assessment is important for Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Traditional speech pronunciation assessment, based on the Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) algorithm, has some weakness in assessing a speech utterance: 1) Phoneme GOP scores cannot be easily translated into a sentence score with a simple average for effective assessment; 2) The rank ordering information has not been well exploited in GOP scoring for delivering a robust assessment and correlate well with a human rater's evaluations. In this paper, we propose two new statistical features, average GOP (aGOP) and confusion GOP (cGOP) and use them to train a binary classifier in Ordinal Regression with Anchored Reference Samples (ORARS). When the proposed approach is tested on Microsoft mTutor ESL Dataset, a relative improvement of Pearson correlation coefficient of 26.9% is obtained over the conventional GOP-based one. The performance is at a human-parity level or better than human raters.", "published": "2020-10-26 04:53:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13339v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
