{"title": "Multi-Task Cross-Lingual Sequence Tagging from Scratch", "abstract": "We present a deep hierarchical recurrent neural network for sequence tagging.\nGiven a sequence of words, our model employs deep gated recurrent units on both\ncharacter and word levels to encode morphology and context information, and\napplies a conditional random field layer to predict the tags. Our model is task\nindependent, language independent, and feature engineering free. We further\nextend our model to multi-task and cross-lingual joint training by sharing the\narchitecture and parameters. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in\nmultiple languages on several benchmark tasks including POS tagging, chunking,\nand NER. We also demonstrate that multi-task and cross-lingual joint training\ncan improve the performance in various cases.", "published": "2016-03-20 21:15:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06270v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
