{"title": "Termhood-based Comparability Metrics of Comparable Corpus in Special\n  Domain", "abstract": "Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation (MT)\nresources, such as dictionaries and parallel corpora, are scarce and hard to\ncome by for special domains. Besides, these resources are just limited to a few\nlanguages, such as English, French, and Spanish and so on. So, obtaining\ncomparable corpora automatically for such domains could be an answer to this\nproblem effectively. Comparable corpora, that the subcorpora are not\ntranslations of each other, can be easily obtained from web. Therefore,\nbuilding and using comparable corpora is often a more feasible option in\nmultilingual information processing. Comparability metrics is one of key issues\nin the field of building and using comparable corpus. Currently, there is no\nwidely accepted definition or metrics method of corpus comparability. In fact,\nDifferent definitions or metrics methods of comparability might be given to\nsuit various tasks about natural language processing. A new comparability,\nnamely, termhood-based metrics, oriented to the task of bilingual terminology\nextraction, is proposed in this paper. In this method, words are ranked by\ntermhood not frequency, and then the cosine similarities, calculated based on\nthe ranking lists of word termhood, is used as comparability. Experiments\nresults show that termhood-based metrics performs better than traditional\nfrequency-based metrics.", "published": "2013-02-19 00:30:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4489v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Bilingual Terminology Extraction Using Multi-level Termhood", "abstract": "Purpose: Terminology is the set of technical words or expressions used in\nspecific contexts, which denotes the core concept in a formal discipline and is\nusually applied in the fields of machine translation, information retrieval,\ninformation extraction and text categorization, etc. Bilingual terminology\nextraction plays an important role in the application of bilingual dictionary\ncompilation, bilingual Ontology construction, machine translation and\ncross-language information retrieval etc. This paper addresses the issues of\nmonolingual terminology extraction and bilingual term alignment based on\nmulti-level termhood.\n  Design/methodology/approach: A method based on multi-level termhood is\nproposed. The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as\nwell as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the\ncorpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have differently\ndistribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance\nthe performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel\ncorpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints\nis presented.\n  Findings: Experiment results show multi-level termhood can get better\nperformance than existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is\nused as constrain factor, the performance of bilingual term alignment can be\nimproved.", "published": "2013-02-19 00:37:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4492v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Complex networks analysis of language complexity", "abstract": "Methods from statistical physics, such as those involving complex networks,\nhave been increasingly used in quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena.\nIn this paper, we represented pieces of text with different levels of\nsimplification in co-occurrence networks and found that topological regularity\ncorrelated negatively with textual complexity. Furthermore, in less complex\ntexts the distance between concepts, represented as nodes, tended to decrease.\nThe complex networks metrics were treated with multivariate pattern recognition\ntechniques, which allowed us to distinguish between original texts and their\nsimplified versions. For each original text, two simplified versions were\ngenerated manually with increasing number of simplification operations. As\nexpected, distinction was easier for the strongly simplified versions, where\nthe most relevant metrics were node strength, shortest paths and diversity.\nAlso, the discrimination of complex texts was improved with higher hierarchical\nnetwork metrics, thus pointing to the usefulness of considering wider contexts\naround the concepts. Though the accuracy rate in the distinction was not as\nhigh as in methods using deep linguistic knowledge, the complex network\napproach is still useful for a rapid screening of texts whenever assessing\ncomplexity is essential to guarantee accessibility to readers with limited\nreading ability", "published": "2013-02-19 00:32:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4490v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
