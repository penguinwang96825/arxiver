By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the\ndocuments, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire\nresearch workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived\nfrom an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two\ndecades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition\nfrom feature engineering to ablation studies.

{"title": "Safe Reinforcement Learning using Action Projection: Safeguard the Policy or the Environment?", "abstract": "Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them\nto the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints\nin reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly\nconsidered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part\nof the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the\npolicy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical\nrelevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their\ndifferences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of\nSE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected\nby action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected\nto the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In\nSE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it\nmanifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through\nthe safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of\nSE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical\nanalysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role\nof action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,\nincluding a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with\nestablished SE-RL practices.

{"title": "Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection", "abstract": "We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural\narchitecture designed for MIMO detection.

Recent\nTransformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the\nMIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT\naddresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes\ncontextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with\ngraph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across\nsubgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors,\nproducing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency.\nExperiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a\nflexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft\npriors.", "published": "2025-09-16 05:42:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v2", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "EMC Limit Level Guidelines for In-System Interference with GPS Receivers", "abstract": "Because GPS signals are weak, electronic systems and components that are\nplaced near GPS receivers can easily cause disruptive electromagnetic\ninterference through their unintended radiated emissions. In this paper, EMC\nlimit level guidelines are presented for electronics that are intended to be\nplaced near to GPS receivers, as often happens in automotive and other\napplications. One of the challenges of defining limit-levels for systems\nintended to be integrated with GPS receivers is that the impact of noise at the\ninput of the receiver may vary substantially depending on the form of the noise\ndue to the correlator function implemented by GPS receiver. The quality of the\ncorrelated signal is typically represented using the carrier-to-noise ratio ($C\n/ N_0$).

To tackle the non-convexity, the problem is decoupled into two\nsubproblems: the first subproblem optimizes STAR-RIS phase shift vectors and\nbeamforming matrices across all WPT-FL phases using block coordinate descent\nover either semi-definite programming or Rayleigh quotient problems, while the\nsecond one allocates time, power, and computation frequency via the\none-dimensional search algorithms or the bisection algorithm.", "published": "2025-09-16 18:17:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13441v1", "categories": ["cs.IT", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}

However, existing\nmethods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent\ncharacteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among\nagents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive\nDiversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that\nincorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage\npolicy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing\ninspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of\nmoderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we\ndesign an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce\ncompetitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and\ndistributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance\nbetween competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized\ncentralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the\nconstrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task\nobjectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the\nSMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon\nachieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively\npromoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.", "published": "2025-09-16 07:26:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14276v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
