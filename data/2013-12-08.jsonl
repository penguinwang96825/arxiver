{"title": "Time-dependent Hierarchical Dirichlet Model for Timeline Generation", "abstract": "Timeline Generation aims at summarizing news from different epochs and\ntelling readers how an event evolves. It is a new challenge that combines\nsalience ranking with novelty detection. For long-term public events, the main\ntopic usually includes various aspects across different epochs and each aspect\nhas its own evolving pattern. Existing approaches neglect such hierarchical\ntopic structure involved in the news corpus in timeline generation. In this\npaper, we develop a novel time-dependent Hierarchical Dirichlet Model (HDM) for\ntimeline generation. Our model can aptly detect different levels of topic\ninformation across corpus and such structure is further used for sentence\nselection. Based on the topic mined fro HDM, sentences are selected by\nconsidering different aspects such as relevance, coherence and coverage. We\ndevelop experimental systems to evaluate 8 long-term events that public\nconcern. Performance comparison between different systems demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our model in terms of ROUGE metrics.", "published": "2013-12-08 19:15:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2244v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
