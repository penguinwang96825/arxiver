{"title": "Deep Learning for Answer Sentence Selection", "abstract": "Answer sentence selection is the task of identifying sentences that contain\nthe answer to a given question. This is an important problem in its own right\nas well as in the larger context of open domain question answering. We propose\na novel approach to solving this task via means of distributed representations,\nand learn to match questions with answers by considering their semantic\nencoding. This contrasts prior work on this task, which typically relies on\nclassifiers with large numbers of hand-crafted syntactic and semantic features\nand various external resources. Our approach does not require any feature\nengineering nor does it involve specialist linguistic data, making this model\neasily applicable to a wide range of domains and languages. Experimental\nresults on a standard benchmark dataset from TREC demonstrate that---despite\nits simplicity---our model matches state of the art performance on the answer\nsentence selection task.", "published": "2014-12-04 11:53:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1632v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
