{"title": "Using Ontology-Based Context in the Portuguese-English Translation of\n  Homographs in Textual Dialogues", "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the existing gap on message\ntranslations in dialogue systems. Currently, submitted messages to the dialogue\nsystems are considered as isolated sentences. Thus, missing context information\nimpede the disambiguation of homographs words in ambiguous sentences. Our\napproach solves this disambiguation problem by using concepts over existing\nontologies.", "published": "2015-10-07 10:50:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01886v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Assisting Composition of Email Responses: a Topic Prediction Approach", "abstract": "We propose an approach for helping agents compose email replies to customer\nrequests. To enable that, we use LDA to extract latent topics from a collection\nof email exchanges. We then use these latent topics to label our data,\nobtaining a so-called \"silver standard\" topic labelling. We exploit this\nlabelled set to train a classifier to: (i) predict the topic distribution of\nthe entire agent's email response, based on features of the customer's email;\nand (ii) predict the topic distribution of the next sentence in the agent's\nreply, based on the customer's email features and on features of the agent's\ncurrent sentence. The experimental results on a large email collection from a\ncontact center in the tele- com domain show that the proposed ap- proach is\neffective in predicting the best topic of the agent's next sentence. In 80% of\nthe cases, the correct topic is present among the top five recommended topics\n(out of fifty possible ones). This shows the potential of this method to be\napplied in an interactive setting, where the agent is presented a small list of\nlikely topics to choose from for the next sentence.", "published": "2015-10-07 18:08:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02049v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Resolving References to Objects in Photographs using the\n  Words-As-Classifiers Model", "abstract": "A common use of language is to refer to visually present objects. Modelling\nit in computers requires modelling the link between language and perception.\nThe \"words as classifiers\" model of grounded semantics views words as\nclassifiers of perceptual contexts, and composes the meaning of a phrase\nthrough composition of the denotations of its component words. It was recently\nshown to perform well in a game-playing scenario with a small number of object\ntypes. We apply it to two large sets of real-world photographs that contain a\nmuch larger variety of types and for which referring expressions are available.\nUsing a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract image features, and\naugmenting these with in-picture positional information, we show that the model\nachieves performance competitive with the state of the art in a reference\nresolution task (given expression, find bounding box of its referent), while,\nas we argue, being conceptually simpler and more flexible.", "published": "2015-10-07 20:52:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02125v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Helping Domain Experts Build Speech Translation Systems", "abstract": "We present a new platform, \"Regulus Lite\", which supports rapid development\nand web deployment of several types of phrasal speech translation systems using\na minimal formalism. A distinguishing feature is that most development work can\nbe performed directly by domain experts. We motivate the need for platforms of\nthis type and discuss three specific cases: medical speech translation,\nspeech-to-sign-language translation and voice questionnaires.

{"title": "Hierarchical Representation of Prosody for Statistical Speech Synthesis", "abstract": "Prominences and boundaries are the essential constituents of prosodic\nstructure in speech. They provide for means to chunk the speech stream into\nlinguistically relevant units by providing them with relative saliences and\ndemarcating them within coherent utterance structures. Prominences and\nboundaries have both been widely used in both basic research on prosody as well\nas in text-to-speech synthesis. However, there are no representation schemes\nthat would provide for both estimating and modelling them in a unified fashion.\nHere we present an unsupervised unified account for estimating and representing\nprosodic prominences and boundaries using a scale-space analysis based on\ncontinuous wavelet transform. The methods are evaluated and compared to earlier\nwork using the Boston University Radio News corpus. The results show that the\nproposed method is comparable with the best published supervised annotation\nmethods.", "published": "2015-10-07 14:08:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01949v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
