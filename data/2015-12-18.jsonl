{"title": "A Planning based Framework for Essay Generation", "abstract": "Generating an article automatically with computer program is a challenging\ntask in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. In this paper,\nwe target at essay generation, which takes as input a topic word in mind and\ngenerates an organized article under the theme of the topic. We follow the idea\nof text planning \\cite{Reiter1997} and develop an essay generation framework.\nThe framework consists of three components, including topic understanding,\nsentence extraction and sentence reordering. For each component, we studied\nseveral statistical algorithms and empirically compared between them in terms\nof qualitative or quantitative analysis. Although we run experiments on Chinese\ncorpus, the method is language independent and can be easily adapted to other\nlanguage. We lay out the remaining challenges and suggest avenues for future\nresearch.", "published": "2015-12-18 12:10:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05919v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Morphological Inflection Generation Using Character Sequence to Sequence\n  Learning", "abstract": "Morphological inflection generation is the task of generating the inflected\nform of a given lemma corresponding to a particular linguistic transformation.\nWe model the problem of inflection generation as a character sequence to\nsequence learning problem and present a variant of the neural encoder-decoder\nmodel for solving it. Our model is language independent and can be trained in\nboth supervised and semi-supervised settings. We evaluate our system on seven\ndatasets of morphologically rich languages and achieve either better or\ncomparable results to existing state-of-the-art models of inflection\ngeneration.", "published": "2015-12-18 20:48:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06110v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
