{"title": "CAN: Constrained Attention Networks for Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "Aspect level sentiment classification is a fine-grained sentiment analysis\ntask. To detect the sentiment towards a particular aspect in a sentence,\nprevious studies have developed various attention-based methods for generating\naspect-specific sentence representations. However, the attention may inherently\nintroduce noise and downgrade the performance. In this paper, we propose\nconstrained attention networks (CAN), a simple yet effective solution, to\nregularize the attention for multi-aspect sentiment analysis, which alleviates\nthe drawback of the attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce orthogonal\nregularization on multiple aspects and sparse regularization on each single\naspect. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach. We further extend our approach to multi-task\nsettings and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.", "published": "2018-12-27 14:49:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10735v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Cross-relation Cross-bag Attention for Distantly-supervised Relation\n  Extraction", "abstract": "Distant supervision leverages knowledge bases to automatically label\ninstances, thus allowing us to train relation extractor without human\nannotations. However, the generated training data typically contain massive\nnoise, and may result in poor performances with the vanilla supervised\nlearning. In this paper, we propose to conduct multi-instance learning with a\nnovel Cross-relation Cross-bag Selective Attention (C$^2$SA), which leads to\nnoise-robust training for distant supervised relation extractor. Specifically,\nwe employ the sentence-level selective attention to reduce the effect of noisy\nor mismatched sentences, while the correlation among relations were captured to\nimprove the quality of attention weights. Moreover, instead of treating all\nentity-pairs equally, we try to pay more attention to entity-pairs with a\nhigher quality. Similarly, we adopt the selective attention mechanism to\nachieve this goal. Experiments with two types of relation extractor demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art, while\nfurther ablation studies verify our intuitions and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed two techniques.", "published": "2018-12-27 03:03:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10604v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Intent Detection and Slots Prompt in a Closed-Domain Chatbot", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a methodology for predicting intent and slots of\na query for a chatbot that answers career-related queries. We take a\nmulti-staged approach where both the processes (intent-classification and\nslot-tagging) inform each other's decision-making in different stages. The\nmodel breaks down the problem into stages, solving one problem at a time and\npassing on relevant results of the current stage to the next, thereby reducing\nsearch space for subsequent stages, and eventually making classification and\ntagging more viable after each stage. We also observe that relaxing rules for a\nfuzzy entity-matching in slot-tagging after each stage (by maintaining a\nseparate Named Entity Tagger per stage) helps us improve performance, although\nat a slight cost of false-positives. Our model has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance with F1-score of 77.63% for intent-classification and 82.24% for\nslot-tagging on our dataset that we would publicly release along with the\npaper.", "published": "2018-12-27 05:14:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10628v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "QRFA: A Data-Driven Model of Information-Seeking Dialogues", "abstract": "Understanding the structure of interaction processes helps us to improve\ninformation-seeking dialogue systems. Analyzing an interaction process boils\ndown to discovering patterns in sequences of alternating utterances exchanged\nbetween a user and an agent. Process mining techniques have been successfully\napplied to analyze structured event logs, discovering the underlying process\nmodels or evaluating whether the observed behavior is in conformance with the\nknown process. In this paper, we apply process mining techniques to discover\npatterns in conversational transcripts and extract a new model of\ninformation-seeking dialogues, QRFA, for Query, Request, Feedback, Answer. Our\nresults are grounded in an empirical evaluation across multiple conversational\ndatasets from different domains, which was never attempted before. We show that\nthe QRFA model better reflects conversation flows observed in real\ninformation-seeking conversations than models proposed previously. Moreover,\nQRFA allows us to identify malfunctioning in dialogue system transcripts as\ndeviations from the expected conversation flow described by the model via\nconformance analysis.", "published": "2018-12-27 13:36:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10720v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Advancing the State of the Art in Open Domain Dialog Systems through the\n  Alexa Prize", "abstract": "Building open domain conversational systems that allow users to have engaging\nconversations on topics of their choice is a challenging task. Alexa Prize was\nlaunched in 2016 to tackle the problem of achieving natural, sustained,\ncoherent and engaging open-domain dialogs. In the second iteration of the\ncompetition in 2018, university teams advanced the state of the art by using\ncontext in dialog models, leveraging knowledge graphs for language\nunderstanding, handling complex utterances, building statistical and\nhierarchical dialog managers, and leveraging model-driven signals from user\nresponses. The 2018 competition also included the provision of a suite of tools\nand models to the competitors including the CoBot (conversational bot) toolkit,\ntopic and dialog act detection models, conversation evaluators, and a sensitive\ncontent detection model so that the competing teams could focus on building\nknowledge-rich, coherent and engaging multi-turn dialog systems. This paper\noutlines the advances developed by the university teams as well as the Alexa\nPrize team to achieve the common goal of advancing the science of\nConversational AI. We address several key open-ended problems such as\nconversational speech recognition, open domain natural language understanding,\ncommonsense reasoning, statistical dialog management, and dialog evaluation.\nThese collaborative efforts have driven improved experiences by Alexa users to\nan average rating of 3.61, the median duration of 2 mins 18 seconds, and\naverage turns to 14.6, increases of 14%, 92%, 54% respectively since the launch\nof the 2018 competition. For conversational speech recognition, we have\nimproved our relative Word Error Rate by 55% and our relative Entity Error Rate\nby 34% since the launch of the Alexa Prize. Socialbots improved in quality\nsignificantly more rapidly in 2018, in part due to the release of the CoBot\ntoolkit.", "published": "2018-12-27 16:17:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10757v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Tied Hidden Factors in Neural Networks for End-to-End Speaker\n  Recognition", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a method to model speaker and session variability\nand able to generate likelihood ratios using neural networks in an end-to-end\nphrase dependent speaker verification system. As in Joint Factor Analysis, the\nmodel uses tied hidden variables to model speaker and session variability and a\nMAP adaptation of some of the parameters of the model. In the training\nprocedure our method jointly estimates the network parameters and the values of\nthe speaker and channel hidden variables. This is done in a two-step\nbackpropagation algorithm, first the network weights and factor loading\nmatrices are updated and then the hidden variables, whose gradients are\ncalculated by aggregating the corresponding speaker or session frames, since\nthese hidden variables are tied. The last layer of the network is defined as a\nlinear regression probabilistic model whose inputs are the previous layer\noutputs. This choice has the advantage that it produces likelihoods and\nadditionally it can be adapted during the enrolment using MAP without the need\nof a gradient optimization. The decisions are made based on the ratio of the\noutput likelihoods of two neural network models, speaker adapted and universal\nbackground model. The method was evaluated on the RSR2015 database.", "published": "2018-12-27 17:07:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11946v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
