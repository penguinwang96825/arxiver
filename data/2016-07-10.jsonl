{"title": "Charagram: Embedding Words and Sentences via Character n-grams", "abstract": "We present Charagram embeddings, a simple approach for learning\ncharacter-based compositional models to embed textual sequences. A word or\nsentence is represented using a character n-gram count vector, followed by a\nsingle nonlinear transformation to yield a low-dimensional embedding. We use\nthree tasks for evaluation: word similarity, sentence similarity, and\npart-of-speech tagging. We demonstrate that Charagram embeddings outperform\nmore complex architectures based on character-level recurrent and convolutional\nneural networks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on several\nsimilarity tasks.", "published": "2016-07-10 21:59:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02789v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Syntactic Phylogenetic Trees", "abstract": "In this paper we identify several serious problems that arise in the use of\nsyntactic data from the SSWL database for the purpose of computational\nphylogenetic reconstruction. We show that the most naive approach fails to\nproduce reliable linguistic phylogenetic trees. We identify some of the sources\nof the observed problems and we discuss how they may be, at least partly,\ncorrected by using additional information, such as prior subdivision into\nlanguage families and subfamilies, and a better use of the information about\nancient languages. We also describe how the use of phylogenetic algebraic\ngeometry can help in estimating to what extent the probability distribution at\nthe leaves of the phylogenetic tree obtained from the SSWL data can be\nconsidered reliable, by testing it on phylogenetic trees established by other\nforms of linguistic analysis. In simple examples, we find that, after\nrestricting to smaller language subfamilies and considering only those SSWL\nparameters that are fully mapped for the whole subfamily, the SSWL data match\nextremely well reliable phylogenetic trees, according to the evaluation of\nphylogenetic invariants. This is a promising sign for the use of SSWL data for\nlinguistic phylogenetics.", "published": "2016-07-10 22:25:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02791v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "91F20, 13P10"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Annotation Methodologies for Vision and Language Dataset Creation", "abstract": "Annotated datasets are commonly used in the training and evaluation of tasks\ninvolving natural language and vision (image description generation, action\nrecognition and visual question answering). However, many of the existing\ndatasets reflect problems that emerge in the process of data selection and\nannotation. Here we point out some of the difficulties and problems one\nconfronts when creating and validating annotated vision and language datasets.", "published": "2016-07-10 18:11:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02769v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Open Information Extraction", "abstract": "Open Information Extraction (Open IE) systems aim to obtain relation tuples\nwith highly scalable extraction in portable across domain by identifying a\nvariety of relation phrases and their arguments in arbitrary sentences. The\nfirst generation of Open IE learns linear chain models based on unlexicalized\nfeatures such as Part-of-Speech (POS) or shallow tags to label the intermediate\nwords between pair of potential arguments for identifying extractable\nrelations. Open IE currently is developed in the second generation that is able\nto extract instances of the most frequently observed relation types such as\nVerb, Noun and Prep, Verb and Prep, and Infinitive with deep linguistic\nanalysis. They expose simple yet principled ways in which verbs express\nrelationships in linguistics such as verb phrase-based extraction or\nclause-based extraction. They obtain a significantly higher performance over\nprevious systems in the first generation. In this paper, we describe an\noverview of two Open IE generations including strengths, weaknesses and\napplication areas.", "published": "2016-07-10 20:39:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02784v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
