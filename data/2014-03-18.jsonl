{"title": "A hybrid formalism to parse Sign Languages", "abstract": "Sign Language (SL) linguistic is dependent on the expensive task of\nannotating. Some automation is already available for low-level information (eg.\nbody part tracking) and the lexical level has shown significant progresses. The\nsyntactic level lacks annotated corpora as well as complete and consistent\nmodels. This article presents a solution for the automatic annotation of SL\nsyntactic elements. It exposes a formalism able to represent both\nconstituency-based and dependency-based models. The first enable the\nrepresentation the structures one may want to annotate, the second aims at\nfulfilling the holes of the first. A parser is presented and used to conduct\ntwo experiments on the solution. One experiment is on a real corpus, the other\nis on a synthetic corpus.", "published": "2014-03-18 14:16:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4467v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Sign Language Gibberish for syntactic parsing evaluation", "abstract": "Sign Language (SL) automatic processing slowly progresses bottom-up. The\nfield has seen proposition to handle the video signal, to recognize and\nsynthesize sublexical and lexical units. It starts to see the development of\nsupra-lexical processing. But the recognition, at this level, lacks data. The\nsyntax of SL appears very specific as it uses massively the multiplicity of\narticulators and its access to the spatial dimensions. Therefore new parsing\ntechniques are developed. However these need to be evaluated. The shortage on\nreal data restrains the corpus-based models to small sizes. We propose here a\nsolution to produce data-sets for the evaluation of parsers on the specific\nproperties of SL. The article first describes the general model used to\ngenerates dependency grammars and the phrase generation from these lasts. It\nthen discusses the limits of approach. The solution shows to be of particular\ninterest to evaluate the scalability of the techniques on big models.", "published": "2014-03-18 14:31:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4473v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
