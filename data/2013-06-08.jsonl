{"title": "Learning About Meetings", "abstract": "Most people participate in meetings almost every day, multiple times a day.\nThe study of meetings is important, but also challenging, as it requires an\nunderstanding of social signals and complex interpersonal dynamics. Our aim\nthis work is to use a data-driven approach to the science of meetings. We\nprovide tentative evidence that: i) it is possible to automatically detect when\nduring the meeting a key decision is taking place, from analyzing only the\nlocal dialogue acts, ii) there are common patterns in the way social dialogue\nacts are interspersed throughout a meeting, iii) at the time key decisions are\nmade, the amount of time left in the meeting can be predicted from the amount\nof time that has passed, iv) it is often possible to predict whether a proposal\nduring a meeting will be accepted or rejected based entirely on the language\n(the set of persuasive words) used by the speaker.", "published": "2013-06-08 14:59:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1927v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
