{"title": "Data Mining of the Concept \"End of the World\" in Twitter Microblogs", "abstract": "This paper describes the analysis of quantitative characteristics of frequent\nsets and association rules in the posts of Twitter microblogs, related to the\ndiscussion of \"end of the world\", which was allegedly predicted on December 21,\n2012 due to the Mayan calendar. Discovered frequent sets and association rules\ncharacterize semantic relations between the concepts of analyzed subjects.The\nsupport for some fequent sets reaches the global maximum before the expected\nevent with some time delay. Such frequent sets may be considered as predictive\nmarkers that characterize the significance of expected events for blogosphere\nusers. It was shown that time dynamics of confidence of some revealed\nassociation rules can also have predictive characteristics. Exceeding a certain\nthreshold, it may be a signal for the corresponding reaction in the society\nduring the time interval between the maximum and probable coming of an event.", "published": "2013-02-08 19:56:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2131v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
