{"title": "Boundary identification of events in clinical named entity recognition", "abstract": "The problem of named entity recognition in the medical/clinical domain has\ngained increasing attention do to its vital role in a wide range of clinical\ndecision support applications. The identification of complete and correct term\nspan is vital for further knowledge synthesis (e.g., coding/mapping concepts\nthesauruses and classification standards). This paper investigates boundary\nadjustment by sequence labeling representations models and post-processing\ntechniques in the problem of clinical named entity recognition (recognition of\nclinical events). Using current state-of-the-art sequence labeling algorithm\n(conditional random fields), we show experimentally that sequence labeling\nrepresentation and post-processing can be significantly helpful in strict\nboundary identification of clinical events.", "published": "2013-08-05 15:14:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1004v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Context Specific Event Model For News Articles", "abstract": "We present a new context based event indexing and event ranking model for\nNews Articles. The context event clusters formed from the UNL Graphs uses the\nmodified scoring scheme for segmenting events which is followed by clustering\nof events. From the context clusters obtained three models are developed-\nIdentification of Main and Sub events; Event Indexing and Event Ranking. Based\non the properties considered from the UNL Graphs for the modified scoring main\nevents and sub events associated with main-events are identified. The temporal\ndetails obtained from the context cluster are stored using hashmap data\nstructure. The temporal details are place-where the event took; person-who\ninvolved in that event; time-when the event took place. Based on the\ninformation collected from the context clusters three indices are generated-\nTime index, Person index, and Place index. This index gives complete details\nabout every event obtained from context clusters. A new scoring scheme is\nintroduced for ranking the events. The scoring scheme for event ranking gives\nweight-age based on the priority level of the events. The priority level\nincludes the occurrence of the event in the title of the document, event\nfrequency, and inverse document frequency of the events.", "published": "2013-08-05 07:22:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0897v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
