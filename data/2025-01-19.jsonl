{"title": "A statistical technique for cleaning option price data", "abstract": "Recorded option pricing datasets are not always freely available.\nAdditionally, these datasets often contain numerous prices which are either\nhigher or lower than can reasonably be expected. Various reasons for these\nunexpected observations are possible, including human error in the recording of\nthe details associated with the option in question. In order for the analyses\nperformed on these datasets to be reliable, it is necessary to identify and\nremove these options from the dataset. In this paper, we list three distinct\nproblems often found in recorded option price datasets alongside means of\naddressing these. The methods used are justified using sound statistical\nreasoning and remove option prices violating the standard assumption of no\narbitrage. An attractive aspect of the proposed technique is that no option\npricing model-based assumptions are used. Although the discussion is restricted\nto European options, the procedure is easily modified for use with exotic\noptions as well. As a final contribution, the paper contains a link to six\noption pricing datasets which have already been cleaned using the proposed\nmethods and can be freely used by researchers.", "published": "2025-01-19 20:39:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11164v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
