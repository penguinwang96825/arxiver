{"title": "Sentiment Analysis based on User Tag for Traditional Chinese Medicine in\n  Weibo", "abstract": "With the acceptance of Western culture and science, Traditional Chinese\nMedicine (TCM) has become a controversial issue in China. So, it's important to\nstudy the public's sentiment and opinion on TCM. The rapid development of\nonline social network, such as twitter, make it convenient and efficient to\nsample hundreds of millions of people for the aforementioned sentiment study.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt that\napplies sentiment analysis to the domain of TCM on Sina Weibo (a twitter-like\nmicroblogging service in China). In our work, firstly we collect tweets topic\nabout TCM from Sina Weibo, and label the tweets as supporting TCM and opposing\nTCM automatically based on user tag. Then, a support vector machine classifier\nhas been built to predict the sentiment of TCM tweets without labels. Finally,\nwe present a method to adjust the classifier result. The performance of\nF-measure attained with our method is 97%.", "published": "2014-10-13 11:37:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3460v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
