{"title": "Robustification of Segmentation Models Against Adversarial Perturbations In Medical Imaging", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel yet efficient defense framework for segmentation models against adversarial attacks in medical imaging. In contrary to the defense methods against adversarial attacks for classification models which widely are investigated, such defense methods for segmentation models has been less explored. Our proposed method can be used for any deep learning models without revising the target deep learning models, as well as can be independent of adversarial attacks. Our framework consists of a frequency domain converter, a detector, and a reformer. The frequency domain converter helps the detector detects adversarial examples by using a frame domain of an image. The reformer helps target models to predict more precisely. We have experiments to empirically show that our proposed method has a better performance compared to the existing defense method.", "published": "2020-09-23 12:18:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11090v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Fuzzy Simplicial Networks: A Topology-Inspired Model to Improve Task Generalization in Few-shot Learning", "abstract": "Deep learning has shown great success in settings with massive amounts of data but has struggled when data is limited. Few-shot learning algorithms, which seek to address this limitation, are designed to generalize well to new tasks with limited data. Typically, models are evaluated on unseen classes and datasets that are defined by the same fundamental task as they are trained for (e.g. category membership). One can also ask how well a model can generalize to fundamentally different tasks within a fixed dataset (for example: moving from category membership to tasks that involve detecting object orientation or quantity). To formalize this kind of shift we define a notion of \"independence of tasks\" and identify three new sets of labels for established computer vision datasets that test a model's ability to generalize to tasks which draw on orthogonal attributes in the data. We use these datasets to investigate the failure modes of metric-based few-shot models. Based on our findings, we introduce a new few-shot model called Fuzzy Simplicial Networks (FSN) which leverages a construction from topology to more flexibly represent each class from limited data. In particular, FSN models can not only form multiple representations for a given class but can also begin to capture the low-dimensional structure which characterizes class manifolds in the encoded space of deep networks. We show that FSN outperforms state-of-the-art models on the challenging tasks we introduce in this paper while remaining competitive on standard few-shot benchmarks.", "published": "2020-09-23 17:01:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11253v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "math.GN", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Generative Modelling of 3D in-silico Spongiosa with Controllable Micro-Structural Parameters", "abstract": "Research in vertebral bone micro-structure generally requires costly procedures to obtain physical scans of real bone with a specific pathology under study, since no methods are available yet to generate realistic bone structures in-silico. Here we propose to apply recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to develop such a method. We adapted style-transfer techniques, which have been largely used in other contexts, in order to transfer style between image pairs while preserving its informational content. In a first step, we trained a volumetric generative model in a progressive manner using a Wasserstein objective and gradient penalty (PWGAN-GP) to create patches of realistic bone structure in-silico. The training set contained 7660 purely spongeous bone samples from twelve human vertebrae (T12 or L1) with isotropic resolution of 164um and scanned with a high resolution peripheral quantitative CT (Scanco XCT). After training, we generated new samples with tailored micro-structure properties by optimizing a vector z in the learned latent space. To solve this optimization problem, we formulated a differentiable goal function that leads to valid samples while compromising the appearance (content) with target 3D properties (style). Properties of the learned latent space effectively matched the data distribution. Furthermore, we were able to simulate the resulting bone structure after deterioration or treatment effects of osteoporosis therapies based only on expected changes of micro-structural parameters. Our method allows to generate a virtually infinite number of patches of realistic bone micro-structure, and thereby likely serves for the development of bone-biomarkers and to simulate bone therapies in advance.", "published": "2020-09-23 18:11:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11327v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "The Quotient in Preorder Theories", "abstract": "Seeking the largest solution to an expression of the form A x <= B is a common task in several domains of engineering and computer science. This largest solution is commonly called quotient. Across domains, the meanings of the binary operation and the preorder are quite different, yet the syntax for computing the largest solution is remarkably similar. This paper is about finding a common framework to reason about quotients. We only assume we operate on a preorder endowed with an abstract monotonic multiplication and an involution. We provide a condition, called admissibility, which guarantees the existence of the quotient, and which yields its closed form. We call preordered heaps those structures satisfying the admissibility condition. We show that many existing theories in computer science are preordered heaps, and we are thus able to derive a quotient for them, subsuming existing solutions when available in the literature. We introduce the concept of sieved heaps to deal with structures which are given over multiple domains of definition. We show that sieved heaps also have well-defined quotients.", "published": "2020-09-23 01:27:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10886v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.FL", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "A Deep Learning Algorithm for Objective Assessment of Hypernasality in Children with Cleft Palate", "abstract": "Objectives: Evaluation of hypernasality requires extensive perceptual training by clinicians and extending this training on a large scale internationally is untenable; this compounds the health disparities that already exist among children with cleft. In this work, we present the objective hypernasality measure (OHM), a speech analytics algorithm that automatically measures hypernasality in speech, and validate it relative to a group of trained clinicians. Methods: We trained a deep neural network (DNN) on approximately 100 hours of a publicly-available healthy speech corpus to detect the presence of nasal acoustic cues generated through the production of nasal consonants and nasalized phonemes in speech. Importantly, this model does not require any clinical data for training. The posterior probabilities of the deep learning model were aggregated at the sentence and speaker-levels to compute the OHM.\n  Results: The results showed that the OHM was significantly correlated with the perceptual hypernasality ratings in the Americleft database ( r=0.797, ~p$<$0.001), and with the New Mexico Cleft Palate Center (NMCPC) database (r=0.713,p<$0.001). In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the OHM and articulation errors; the sensitivity of the OHM in detecting the presence of very mild hypernasality; and establishing the internal reliability of the metric. Further, the performance of OHM was compared with a DNN regression algorithm directly trained on the hypernasal speech samples. Significance: The results indicate that the OHM is able to rate the severity of hypernasality on par with Americleft-trained clinicians on this dataset.", "published": "2020-09-23 19:53:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11354v1", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
