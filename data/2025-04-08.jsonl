{"title": "A Mean-Reverting Model of Exchange Rate Risk Premium Using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Dynamics", "abstract": "This paper examines the empirical failure of uncovered interest parity (UIP)\nand proposes a structural explanation based on a mean-reverting risk premium.\nWe define a realized premium as the deviation between observed exchange rate\nreturns and the interest rate differential, and demonstrate its strong\nmean-reverting behavior across multiple horizons. Motivated by this pattern, we\nmodel the risk premium using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process embedded within\na stochastic differential equation for the exchange rate.\n  Our model yields closed-form approximations for future exchange rate\ndistributions, which we evaluate using coverage-based backtesting. Applied to\nUSD/KRW data from 2010 to 2025, the model shows strong predictive performance\nat both short-term and long-term horizons, while underperforming at\nintermediate (3-month) horizons and showing conservative behavior in the tails\nof long-term forecasts. These results suggest that exchange rate deviations\nfrom UIP may reflect structured, forecastable dynamics rather than pure noise,\nand point to future modeling improvements via regime-switching or time-varying\nvolatility.", "published": "2025-04-08 13:33:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06028v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.ST", "91G80, 60J60"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Are Generative AI Agents Effective Personalized Financial Advisors?", "abstract": "Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a\nlow-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as\nmovie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes\ndomains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial\nrisk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance\ndomain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences\nwhen users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized\nguidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor\npersonality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study\nwith 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor\nperformance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve\nconflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to\npositively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our\nresults show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the\nLLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward\nunsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of\nadvice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed,\nusers reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional\ntrust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents\nprovided worse advice.", "published": "2025-04-08 09:41:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.IR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Local signature-based expansions", "abstract": "We study the local (in time) expansion of a continuous-time process and its\nconditional moments, including the process' characteristic function. The\nexpansions are conducted by using the properties of the (time-extended) Ito\nsignature, a tractable basis composed of iterated integrals of the driving\ndeterministic and stochastic signals: time, multiple correlated Brownian\nmotions and multiple correlated compound Poisson processes. We show that these\nproperties are conducive to automated expansions to any order with explicit\ncoefficients and, therefore, to stochastic representations in which asymptotics\ncan be conducted for a shrinking time (t to 0), as in the extant\ncontinuous-time econometrics literature, but, also, for a fixed time (such that\nt smaller than 1) with a diverging expansion order. The latter design opens up\nnovel opportunities for identifying deep characteristics of the assumed\nprocess.", "published": "2025-04-08 18:01:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06351v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}

This research utilizes centered log-ratios\nto transform financial ratios for compositional data analysis. The dataset\ncomprises financial information from 1197 firms in Spain's agricultural and\nfood sectors over the period 2021-2023. The analysis reveals distinct clusters\nof firms with varying financial performance, characterized by metrics of\nsolvency and profitability.
