The main\nhypothesis is that the concealer approach could provide better results than a\nmasker approach in terms of perceived pleasantness. Mixtures of two noise\nsources (ventilation) and five masking sounds (water sounds) were generated\nusing both approaches at various levels. The evaluation of the perceived\npleasantness of these mixtures showed that the masker approach remains more\neffective than the concealer approach, regardless of the noise source, water\nsound, or level used.", "published": "2025-04-08 09:27:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05847v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "Mass-Spring Models for Passive Keyword Spotting: A Springtronics Approach", "abstract": "Mechanical systems played a foundational role in computing history, and have\nregained interest due to their unique properties, such as low damping and the\nability to process mechanical signals without transduction. However, recent\nefforts have primarily focused on elementary computations, implemented in\nsystems based on pre-defined reservoirs, or in periodic systems such as arrays\nof buckling beams. Here, we numerically demonstrate a passive mechanical system\n-- in the form of a nonlinear mass-spring model -- that tackles a real-world\nbenchmark for keyword spotting in speech signals. The model is organized in a\nhierarchical architecture combining feature extraction and continuous-time\nconvolution, with each individual stage tailored to the physics of the\nconsidered mass-spring systems. For each step in the computation, a subsystem\nis designed by combining a small set of low-order polynomial potentials. These\npotentials act as fundamental components that interconnect a network of masses.\nIn analogy to electronic circuit design, where complex functional circuits are\nconstructed by combining basic components into hierarchical designs, we refer\nto this framework as springtronics. We introduce springtronic systems with\nhundreds of degrees of freedom, achieving speech classification accuracy\ncomparable to existing sub-mW electronic systems.", "published": "2025-04-08 08:31:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05802v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "STAGE: Stemmed Accompaniment Generation through Prefix-Based Conditioning", "abstract": "Recent advances in generative models have made it possible to create\nhigh-quality, coherent music, with some systems delivering production-level\noutput. Yet, most existing models focus solely on generating music from\nscratch, limiting their usefulness for musicians who want to integrate such\nmodels into a human, iterative composition workflow. In this paper we introduce\nSTAGE, our STemmed Accompaniment GEneration model, fine-tuned from the\nstate-of-the-art MusicGen to generate single-stem instrumental accompaniments\nconditioned on a given mixture. Inspired by instruction-tuning methods for\nlanguage models, we extend the transformer's embedding matrix with a context\ntoken, enabling the model to attend to a musical context through prefix-based\nconditioning. Compared to the baselines, STAGE yields accompaniments that\nexhibit stronger coherence with the input mixture, higher audio quality, and\ncloser alignment with textual prompts. Moreover, by conditioning on a\nmetronome-like track, our framework naturally supports tempo-constrained\ngeneration, achieving state-of-the-art alignment with the target rhythmic\nstructure--all without requiring any additional tempo-specific module. As a\nresult, STAGE offers a practical, versatile tool for interactive music creation\nthat can be readily adopted by musicians in real-world workflows.", "published": "2025-04-08 05:24:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05690v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "kNN-SVC: Robust Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion with Additive Synthesis and Concatenation Smoothness Optimization", "abstract": "Robustness is critical in zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC). This\npaper introduces two novel methods to strengthen the robustness of the kNN-VC\nframework for SVC. First, kNN-VC's core representation, WavLM, lacks harmonic\nemphasis, resulting in dull sounds and ringing artifacts. To address this, we\nleverage the bijection between WavLM, pitch contours, and spectrograms to\nperform additive synthesis, integrating the resulting waveform into the model\nto mitigate these issues. Second, kNN-VC overlooks concatenative smoothness, a\nkey perceptual factor in SVC. To enhance smoothness, we propose a new distance\nmetric that filters out unsuitable kNN candidates and optimize the summing\nweights of the candidates during inference. Although our techniques are built\non the kNN-VC framework for implementation convenience, they are broadly\napplicable to general concatenative neural synthesis models. Experimental\nresults validate the effectiveness of these modifications in achieving robust\nSVC.

{"title": "Nes2Net: A Lightweight Nested Architecture for Foundation Model Driven Speech Anti-spoofing", "abstract": "Speech foundation models have significantly advanced various speech-related\ntasks by providing exceptional representation capabilities. However, their\nhigh-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task\nmodels, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is\nto apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases\nparameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information.\nTo address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight\nback-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features\nwithout DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature\nextraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional\ninformation. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake\ndetection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end\ncomputational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally,\nextensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5,\nPartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial\nattacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights\nNes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.
