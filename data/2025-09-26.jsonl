We investigate the\nrelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542\nexpert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality\nvia close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram\nnovelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of\ntop-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,\ncautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone.

{"title": "Transformers Can Learn Connectivity in Some Graphs but Not Others", "abstract": "Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the\nresponses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust\nreasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as\ncausal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

We introduce a\nnew work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary\nclassification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which\nnot only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its\ngenerator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the\nmitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the\nboundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper\nwill address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more\nmeaningful way.", "published": "2025-09-26 10:05:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22147v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query.

To address this gap, we introduce\nSceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a\nharmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach\nmanipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential\nvideo outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful\nconstraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually\ncorresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their\nsequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an\nunsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a\nharmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene\nmanipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe\nregion. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns\nfurther improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness.

However, traditional methods for creating these scenes\nrely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which\nare limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this\npaper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene\ngeneration, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap\nbetween high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support\nresearch on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale\ndataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually\ncrafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object\nrelations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial\nReasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,\nspatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D\nlayout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this\nreasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate\nphysically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task\ndescriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of\nMesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes\nwith realistic layouts.

Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct\ntrigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction\nbetween retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships\nbetween target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert\ninfluence on content generation.\n  This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness\nvulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the\npre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group\nwith the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the\npost-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases\nto reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining\nundetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures\nprecise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and\nresilience.

GR performs globally\nnormalized maximum-likelihood optimization and encodes corpus and relevance\ninformation directly in the model parameters, whereas DR adopts locally\nnormalized objectives and represents the corpus with external embeddings before\ncomputing similarity via a bilinear interaction. Our analysis suggests that,\nunder scaling, GR can overcome the inherent limitations of DR, yielding two\nmajor benefits. First, with larger corpora, GR avoids the sharp performance\ndegradation caused by the optimization drift induced by DR's local\nnormalization. Second, with larger models, GR's representational capacity\nscales with parameter size, unconstrained by the global low-rank structure that\nlimits DR.

Conventional\nframeworks, rooted in the Cranfield paradigm and label-based metrics, fail in\nsuch cases because they cannot assess how robustly a system performs under\nuncertain interpretations. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation\nframework that measures both effectiveness and robustness without requiring\nground truth. Given a query or input, VB-Score enumerates plausible\ninterpretations, assigns probabilities, and evaluates output by expected\nsuccess penalized by variance, rewarding consistent performance across intents.\nWe provide a formal analysis of VB-Score, establishing range, monotonicity, and\nstability properties, and relate it to risk-sensitive measures such as\nmean-variance utility. Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric\nretrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by\nconventional metrics. By enabling reproducible, label-free evaluation, VB-Score\noffers a principled foundation for benchmarking machine learning systems in\nambiguous or label-scarce domains.", "published": "2025-09-26 07:54:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22751v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
