{"title": "Does network complexity help organize Babel's library?", "abstract": "In this work, we study properties of texts from the perspective of complex\nnetwork theory. Words in given texts are linked by co-occurrence and\ntransformed into networks, and we observe that these display topological\nproperties common to other complex systems. However, there are some properties\nthat seem to be exclusive to texts; many of these properties depend on the\nfrequency of words in the text, while others seem to be strictly determined by\nthe grammar. Precisely, these properties allow for a categorization of texts as\neither with a sense and others encoded or senseless.", "published": "2014-09-23 16:36:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7336v2", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "nlin.AO", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
