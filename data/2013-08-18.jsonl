{"title": "Consensus Sequence Segmentation", "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a method to detect words or phrases in a given\nsequence of alphabets without knowing the lexicon. Our linear time unsupervised\nalgorithm relies entirely on statistical relationships among alphabets in the\ninput sequence to detect location of word boundaries. We compare our algorithm\nto previous approaches from unsupervised sequence segmentation literature and\nprovide superior segmentation over number of benchmarks.", "published": "2013-08-18 07:09:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3839v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T10"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Natural Language Web Interface for Database (NLWIDB)", "abstract": "It is a long term desire of the computer users to minimize the communication\ngap between the computer and a human. On the other hand, almost all ICT\napplications store information in to databases and retrieve from them.\nRetrieving information from the database requires knowledge of technical\nlanguages such as Structured Query Language. However majority of the computer\nusers who interact with the databases do not have a technical background and\nare intimidated by the idea of using languages such as SQL. For above reasons,\na Natural Language Web Interface for Database (NLWIDB) has been developed. The\nNLWIDB allows the user to query the database in a language more like English,\nthrough a convenient interface over the Internet.", "published": "2013-08-18 04:22:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3830v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DB", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
