{"title": "Part of Speech Tagging of Marathi Text Using Trigram Method", "abstract": "In this paper we present a Marathi part of speech tagger. It is a\nmorphologically rich language. It is spoken by the native people of\nMaharashtra. The general approach used for development of tagger is statistical\nusing trigram Method. The main concept of trigram is to explore the most likely\nPOS for a token based on given information of previous two tags by calculating\nprobabilities to determine which is the best sequence of a tag. In this paper\nwe show the development of the tagger. Moreover we have also shown the\nevaluation done.", "published": "2013-07-15 15:59:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4299v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Rule Based Transliteration Scheme for English to Punjabi", "abstract": "Machine Transliteration has come out to be an emerging and a very important\nresearch area in the field of machine translation. Transliteration basically\naims to preserve the phonological structure of words. Proper transliteration of\nname entities plays a very significant role in improving the quality of machine\ntranslation. In this paper we are doing machine transliteration for\nEnglish-Punjabi language pair using rule based approach. We have constructed\nsome rules for syllabification. Syllabification is the process to extract or\nseparate the syllable from the words. In this we are calculating the\nprobabilities for name entities (Proper names and location). For those words\nwhich do not come under the category of name entities, separate probabilities\nare being calculated by using relative frequency through a statistical machine\ntranslation toolkit known as MOSES. Using these probabilities we are\ntransliterating our input text from English to Punjabi.", "published": "2013-07-15 15:54:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4300v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An alternative Gospel of structure: order, composition, processes", "abstract": "We survey some basic mathematical structures, which arguably are more\nprimitive than the structures taught at school. These structures are orders,\nwith or without composition, and (symmetric) monoidal categories. We list\nseveral `real life' incarnations of each of these. This paper also serves as an\nintroduction to these structures and their current and potentially future uses\nin linguistics, physics and knowledge representation.", "published": "2013-07-15 18:21:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4038v1", "categories": ["math.CT", "cs.CL", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "math.CT"}
