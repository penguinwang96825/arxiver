{"title": "Text Segmentation based on Semantic Word Embeddings", "abstract": "We explore the use of semantic word embeddings in text segmentation\nalgorithms, including the C99 segmentation algorithm and new algorithms\ninspired by the distributed word vector representation. By developing a general\nframework for discussing a class of segmentation objectives, we study the\neffectiveness of greedy versus exact optimization approaches and suggest a new\niterative refinement technique for improving the performance of greedy\nstrategies. We compare our results to known benchmarks, using known metrics. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance for an untrained method with our\nContent Vector Segmentation (CVS) on the Choi test set. Finally, we apply the\nsegmentation procedure to an in-the-wild dataset consisting of text extracted\nfrom scholarly articles in the arXiv.org database.", "published": "2015-03-18 19:44:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05543v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning to Search for Dependencies", "abstract": "We demonstrate that a dependency parser can be built using a credit\nassignment compiler which removes the burden of worrying about low-level\nmachine learning details from the parser implementation. The result is a simple\nparser which robustly applies to many languages that provides similar\nstatistical and computational performance with best-to-date transition-based\nparsing approaches, while avoiding various downsides including randomization,\nextra feature requirements, and custom learning algorithms.", "published": "2015-03-18 23:33:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05615v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
