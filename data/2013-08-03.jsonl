{"title": "Exploring The Contribution of Unlabeled Data in Financial Sentiment\n  Analysis", "abstract": "With the proliferation of its applications in various industries, sentiment\nanalysis by using publicly available web data has become an active research\narea in text classification during these years. It is argued by researchers\nthat semi-supervised learning is an effective approach to this problem since it\nis capable to mitigate the manual labeling effort which is usually expensive\nand time-consuming. However, there was a long-term debate on the effectiveness\nof unlabeled data in text classification. This was partially caused by the fact\nthat many assumptions in theoretic analysis often do not hold in practice. We\nargue that this problem may be further understood by adding an additional\ndimension in the experiment. This allows us to address this problem in the\nperspective of bias and variance in a broader view. We show that the well-known\nperformance degradation issue caused by unlabeled data can be reproduced as a\nsubset of the whole scenario. We argue that if the bias-variance trade-off is\nto be better balanced by a more effective feature selection method unlabeled\ndata is very likely to boost the classification performance. We then propose a\nfeature selection framework in which labeled and unlabeled training samples are\nboth considered. We discuss its potential in achieving such a balance. Besides,\nthe application in financial sentiment analysis is chosen because it not only\nexemplifies an important application, the data possesses better illustrative\npower as well. The implications of this study in text classification and\nfinancial sentiment analysis are both discussed.", "published": "2013-08-03 04:20:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0658v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Comparison of Named Entity Recognition Tools Applied to Biographical\n  Texts", "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a popular domain of natural language\nprocessing. For this reason, many tools exist to perform this task. Amongst\nother points, they differ in the processing method they rely upon, the entity\ntypes they can detect, the nature of the text they can handle, and their\ninput/output formats. This makes it difficult for a user to select an\nappropriate NER tool for a specific situation. In this article, we try to\nanswer this question in the context of biographic texts. For this matter, we\nfirst constitute a new corpus by annotating Wikipedia articles. We then select\npublicly available, well known and free for research NER tools for comparison:\nStanford NER, Illinois NET, OpenCalais NER WS and Alias-i LingPipe. We apply\nthem to our corpus, assess their performances and compare them. When\nconsidering overall performances, a clear hierarchy emerges: Stanford has the\nbest results, followed by LingPipe, Illionois and OpenCalais. However, a more\ndetailed evaluation performed relatively to entity types and article categories\nhighlights the fact their performances are diversely influenced by those\nfactors. This complementarity opens an interesting perspective regarding the\ncombination of these individual tools in order to improve performance.", "published": "2013-08-03 05:57:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0661v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Ontology Enrichment by Extracting Hidden Assertional Knowledge from Text", "abstract": "In this position paper we present a new approach for discovering some special\nclasses of assertional knowledge in the text by using large RDF repositories,\nresulting in the extraction of new non-taxonomic ontological relations. Also we\nuse inductive reasoning beside our approach to make it outperform. Then, we\nprepare a case study by applying our approach on sample data and illustrate the\nsoundness of our proposed approach. Moreover in our point of view current LOD\ncloud is not a suitable base for our proposal in all informational domains.\nTherefore we figure out some directions based on prior works to enrich datasets\nof Linked Data by using web mining. The result of such enrichment can be reused\nfor further relation extraction and ontology enrichment from unstructured free\ntext documents.", "published": "2013-08-03 14:30:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0701v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "68Txx", "I.2.6"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
