In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a\nbenchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human\nlisteners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12\nemotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used\nsix state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of\n111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a\n9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce\nmusic perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend\nto perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under\nhigh-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a\nbias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective\ncontrollability.

Existing\nstylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning,\nwhich complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist\nnames are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers\nsampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for\nstylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish\n(vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use\nfifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions:\nbaseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts\nare generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and\nCLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including\na new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the\nstrongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors\nrecover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as\nthe restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully\nprevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that\ndescriptors encode targeted stylistic cues.
