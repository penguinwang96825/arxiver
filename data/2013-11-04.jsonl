{"title": "A Comparative Study on Linguistic Feature Selection in Sentiment\n  Polarity Classification", "abstract": "Sentiment polarity classification is perhaps the most widely studied topic.\nIt classifies an opinionated document as expressing a positive or negative\nopinion. In this paper, using movie review dataset, we perform a comparative\nstudy with different single kind linguistic features and the combinations of\nthese features. We find that the classic topic-based classifier(Naive Bayes and\nSupport Vector Machine) do not perform as well on sentiment polarity\nclassification. And we find that with some combination of different linguistic\nfeatures, the classification accuracy can be boosted a lot. We give some\nreasonable explanations about these boosting outcomes.", "published": "2013-11-04 20:11:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0833v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
