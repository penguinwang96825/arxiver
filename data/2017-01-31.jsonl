{"title": "Robust Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Shallow\n  Semi-Supervised Features", "abstract": "We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust\nand general set of features across languages and datasets. Our system combines\nshallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on\nlarge amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empirical experimentation\nhow to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to\nseamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a\nsimple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results\nacross five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard\nshared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch.\nFurthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also\nreport best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the\namount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on\nmanually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on\nclustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The\nsystem and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the\nreproducibility of results.", "published": "2017-01-31 16:36:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.09123v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Integrating Reviews into Personalized Ranking for Cold Start\n  Recommendation", "abstract": "Item recommendation task predicts a personalized ranking over a set of items\nfor each individual user. One paradigm is the rating-based methods that\nconcentrate on explicit feedbacks and hence face the difficulties in collecting\nthem. Meanwhile, the ranking-based methods are presented with rated items and\nthen rank the rated above the unrated. This paradigm takes advantage of widely\navailable implicit feedback. It, however, usually ignores a kind of important\ninformation: item reviews. Item reviews not only justify the preferences of\nusers, but also help alleviate the cold-start problem that fails the\ncollaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose two novel and simple models\nto integrate item reviews into Bayesian personalized ranking. In each model, we\nmake use of text features extracted from item reviews using word embeddings. On\ntop of text features we uncover the review dimensions that explain the\nvariation in users' feedback and these review factors represent a prior\npreference of users. Experiments on six real-world data sets show the benefits\nof leveraging item reviews on ranking prediction. We also conduct analyses to\nunderstand the proposed models.", "published": "2017-01-31 02:13:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08888v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "CommAI: Evaluating the first steps towards a useful general AI", "abstract": "With machine learning successfully applied to new daunting problems almost\nevery day, general AI starts looking like an attainable goal. However, most\ncurrent research focuses instead on important but narrow applications, such as\nimage classification or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due\nto the lack of objective ways to measure progress towards broad machine\nintelligence. In order to fill this gap, we propose here a set of concrete\ndesiderata for general AI, together with a platform to test machines on how\nwell they satisfy such desiderata, while keeping all further complexities to a\nminimum.", "published": "2017-01-31 09:20:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08954v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
