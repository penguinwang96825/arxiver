{"title": "American Sign Language fingerspelling recognition from video: Methods\n  for unrestricted recognition and signer-independence", "abstract": "In this thesis, we study the problem of recognizing video sequences of\nfingerspelled letters in American Sign Language (ASL). Fingerspelling comprises\na significant but relatively understudied part of ASL, and recognizing it is\nchallenging for a number of reasons: It involves quick, small motions that are\noften highly coarticulated; it exhibits significant variation between signers;\nand there has been a dearth of continuous fingerspelling data collected. In\nthis work, we propose several types of recognition approaches, and explore the\nsigner variation problem. Our best-performing models are segmental\n(semi-Markov) conditional random fields using deep neural network-based\nfeatures. In the signer-dependent setting, our recognizers achieve up to about\n8% letter error rates. The signer-independent setting is much more challenging,\nbut with neural network adaptation we achieve up to 17% letter error rates.", "published": "2016-08-30 06:12:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08339v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Language Detection For Short Text Messages In Social Media", "abstract": "With the constant growth of the World Wide Web and the number of documents in\ndifferent languages accordingly, the need for reliable language detection tools\nhas increased as well. Platforms such as Twitter with predominantly short texts\nare becoming important information resources, which additionally imposes the\nneed for short texts language detection algorithms. In this paper, we show how\nincorporating personalized user-specific information into the language\ndetection algorithm leads to an important improvement of detection results. To\nchoose the best algorithm for language detection for short text messages, we\ninvestigate several machine learning approaches. These approaches include the\nuse of the well-known classifiers such as SVM and logistic regression, a\ndictionary based approach, and a probabilistic model based on modified\nKneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, the extension of the probabilistic model to\ninclude additional user-specific information such as evidence accumulation per\nuser and user interface language is explored, with the goal of improving the\nclassification performance. The proposed approaches are evaluated on randomly\ncollected Twitter data containing Latin as well as non-Latin alphabet languages\nand the quality of the obtained results is compared, followed by the selection\nof the best performing algorithm. This algorithm is then evaluated against two\nalready existing general language detection tools: Chromium Compact Language\nDetector 2 (CLD2) and langid, where our method significantly outperforms the\nresults achieved by both of the mentioned methods. Additionally, a preview of\nbenefits and possible applications of having a reliable language detection\nalgorithm is given.", "published": "2016-08-30 15:43:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08515v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
