{"title": "Generating Natural Language Descriptions from OWL Ontologies: the\n  NaturalOWL System", "abstract": "We present NaturalOWL, a natural language generation system that produces\ntexts describing individuals or classes of OWL ontologies. Unlike simpler OWL\nverbalizers, which typically express a single axiom at a time in controlled,\noften not entirely fluent natural language primarily for the benefit of domain\nexperts, we aim to generate fluent and coherent multi-sentence texts for\nend-users. With a system like NaturalOWL, one can publish information in OWL on\nthe Web, along with automatically produced corresponding texts in multiple\nlanguages, making the information accessible not only to computer programs and\ndomain experts, but also end-users. We discuss the processing stages of\nNaturalOWL, the optional domain-dependent linguistic resources that the system\ncan use at each stage, and why they are useful. We also present trials showing\nthat when the domain-dependent llinguistic resources are available, NaturalOWL\nproduces significantly better texts compared to a simpler verbalizer, and that\nthe resources can be created with relatively light effort.", "published": "2014-04-24 02:47:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6164v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
