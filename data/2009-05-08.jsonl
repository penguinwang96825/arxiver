{"title": "Matrix Graph Grammars as a Model of Computation", "abstract": "Matrix Graph Grammars (MGG) is a novel approach to the study of graph dynamics ([15]). In the present contribution we look at MGG as a formal grammar and as a model of computation, which is a necessary step in the more ambitious program of tackling complexity theory through MGG. We also study its relation with other well-known models such as Turing machines (TM) and Boolean circuits (BC) as well as non-determinism. As a side effect, all techniques available for MGG can be applied to TMs and BCs.", "published": "2009-05-08 08:35:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1202v3", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CC", "cs.FL"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
