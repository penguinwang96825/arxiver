{"title": "The Controlled Natural Language of Randall Munroe's Thing Explainer", "abstract": "It is rare that texts or entire books written in a Controlled Natural\nLanguage (CNL) become very popular, but exactly this has happened with a book\nthat has been published last year. Randall Munroe's Thing Explainer uses only\nthe 1'000 most often used words of the English language together with drawn\npictures to explain complicated things such as nuclear reactors, jet engines,\nthe solar system, and dishwashers. This restricted language is a very\ninteresting new case for the CNL community. I describe here its place in the\ncontext of existing approaches on Controlled Natural Languages, and I provide a\nfirst analysis from a scientific perspective, covering the word production\nrules and word distributions.", "published": "2016-05-09 07:48:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02457v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "GLEU Without Tuning", "abstract": "The GLEU metric was proposed for evaluating grammatical error corrections\nusing n-gram overlap with a set of reference sentences, as opposed to\nprecision/recall of specific annotated errors (Napoles et al., 2015). This\npaper describes improvements made to the GLEU metric that address problems that\narise when using an increasing number of reference sets. Unlike the originally\npresented metric, the modified metric does not require tuning. We recommend\nthat this version be used instead of the original version.", "published": "2016-05-09 14:05:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02592v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Machine Learning Techniques with Ontology for Subjective Answer\n  Evaluation", "abstract": "Computerized Evaluation of English Essays is performed using Machine learning\ntechniques like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Generalized LSA, Bilingual\nEvaluation Understudy and Maximum Entropy. Ontology, a concept map of domain\nknowledge, can enhance the performance of these techniques. Use of Ontology\nmakes the evaluation process holistic as presence of keywords, synonyms, the\nright word combination and coverage of concepts can be checked. In this paper,\nthe above mentioned techniques are implemented both with and without Ontology\nand tested on common input data consisting of technical answers of Computer\nScience. Domain Ontology of Computer Graphics is designed and developed. The\nsoftware used for implementation includes Java Programming Language and tools\nsuch as MATLAB, Prot\\'eg\\'e, etc. Ten questions from Computer Graphics with\nsixty answers for each question are used for testing. The results are analyzed\nand it is concluded that the results are more accurate with use of Ontology.", "published": "2016-05-09 07:14:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02442v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Ask Your Neurons: A Deep Learning Approach to Visual Question Answering", "abstract": "We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a\nVisual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and\nnatural language processing, we propose Ask Your Neurons, a scalable, jointly\ntrained, end-to-end formulation to this problem.\n  In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where\nthe language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language\ninputs (image and question). We provide additional insights into the problem by\nanalyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which\nwe provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to\nthe ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics\nand collect additional answers which extend the original DAQUAR dataset to\nDAQUAR-Consensus.\n  Moreover, we also extend our analysis to VQA, a large-scale question\nanswering about images dataset, where we investigate some particular design\nchoices and show the importance of stronger visual models. At the same time, we\nachieve strong performance of our model that still uses a global image\nrepresentation. Finally, based on such analysis, we refine our Ask Your Neurons\non DAQUAR, which also leads to a better performance on this challenging task.", "published": "2016-05-09 19:04:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02697v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
