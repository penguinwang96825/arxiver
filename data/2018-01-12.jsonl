{"title": "AliMe Assist: An Intelligent Assistant for Creating an Innovative\n  E-commerce Experience", "abstract": "We present AliMe Assist, an intelligent assistant designed for creating an\ninnovative online shopping experience in E-commerce. Based on question\nanswering (QA), AliMe Assist offers assistance service, customer service, and\nchatting service. It is able to take voice and text input, incorporate context\nto QA, and support multi-round interaction. Currently, it serves millions of\ncustomer questions per day and is able to address 85% of them. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate the system, present the underlying techniques, and share our\nexperience in dealing with real-world QA in the E-commerce field.", "published": "2018-01-12 12:11:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05032v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Speech Dereverberation Based on Integrated Deep and Ensemble Learning\n  Algorithm", "abstract": "Reverberation, which is generally caused by sound reflections from walls,\nceilings, and floors, can result in severe performance degradation of acoustic\napplications. Due to a complicated combination of attenuation and time-delay\neffects, the reverberation property is difficult to characterize, and it\nremains a challenging task to effectively retrieve the anechoic speech signals\nfrom reverberation ones. In the present study, we proposed a novel integrated\ndeep and ensemble learning algorithm (IDEA) for speech dereverberation. The\nIDEA consists of offline and online phases. In the offline phase, we train\nmultiple dereverberation models, each aiming to precisely dereverb speech\nsignals in a particular acoustic environment; then a unified fusion function is\nestimated that aims to integrate the information of multiple dereverberation\nmodels. In the online phase, an input utterance is first processed by each of\nthe dereverberation models. The outputs of all models are integrated\naccordingly to generate the final anechoic signal. We evaluated the IDEA on\ndesigned acoustic environments, including both matched and mismatched\nconditions of the training and testing data. Experimental results confirm that\nthe proposed IDEA outperforms single deep-neural-network-based dereverberation\nmodel with the same model architecture and training data.", "published": "2018-01-12 04:05:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04052v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "Separation of Instrument Sounds using Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n  with Spectral Envelope Constraints", "abstract": "Spectral envelope is one of the most important features that characterize the\ntimbre of an instrument sound. However, it is difficult to use spectral\ninformation in the framework of conventional spectrogram decomposition methods.\nWe overcome this problem by suggesting a simple way to provide a constraint on\nthe spectral envelope calculated by linear prediction. In the first part of\nthis study, we use a pre-trained spectral envelope of known instruments as the\nconstraint. Then we apply the same idea to a blind scenario in which the\ninstruments are unknown. The experimental results reveal that the proposed\nmethod outperforms the conventional methods.", "published": "2018-01-12 08:10:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04081v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.MM", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
