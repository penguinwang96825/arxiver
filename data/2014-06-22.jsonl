{"title": "A CNL for Contract-Oriented Diagrams", "abstract": "We present a first step towards a framework for defining and manipulating\nnormative documents or contracts described as Contract-Oriented (C-O) Diagrams.\nThese diagrams provide a visual representation for such texts, giving the\npossibility to express a signatory's obligations, permissions and prohibitions,\nwith or without timing constraints, as well as the penalties resulting from the\nnon-fulfilment of a contract. This work presents a CNL for verbalising C-O\nDiagrams, a web-based tool allowing editing in this CNL, and another for\nvisualising and manipulating the diagrams interactively. We then show how these\nproof-of-concept tools can be used by applying them to a small example.", "published": "2014-06-22 09:41:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5691v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.FL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Deep Fragment Embeddings for Bidirectional Image Sentence Mapping", "abstract": "We introduce a model for bidirectional retrieval of images and sentences\nthrough a multi-modal embedding of visual and natural language data. Unlike\nprevious models that directly map images or sentences into a common embedding\nspace, our model works on a finer level and embeds fragments of images\n(objects) and fragments of sentences (typed dependency tree relations) into a\ncommon space. In addition to a ranking objective seen in previous work, this\nallows us to add a new fragment alignment objective that learns to directly\nassociate these fragments across modalities. Extensive experimental evaluation\nshows that reasoning on both the global level of images and sentences and the\nfiner level of their respective fragments significantly improves performance on\nimage-sentence retrieval tasks. Additionally, our model provides interpretable\npredictions since the inferred inter-modal fragment alignment is explicit.", "published": "2014-06-22 06:22:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5679v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
