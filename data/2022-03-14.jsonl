{"title": "Optimal Aggregation Strategies for Social Learning over Graphs", "abstract": "Adaptive social learning is a useful tool for studying distributed decision-making problems over graphs. This paper investigates the effect of combination policies on the performance of adaptive social learning strategies. Using large-deviation analysis, it first derives a bound on the steady-state error probability and characterizes the optimal selection for the Perron eigenvectors of the combination policies. It subsequently studies the effect of the combination policy on the transient behavior of the learning strategy by estimating the adaptation time in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In the process, it is discovered that, interestingly, the influence of the combination policy on the transient behavior is insignificant, and thus it is more critical to employ policies that enhance the steady-state performance. The theoretical conclusions are illustrated by means of computer simulations.", "published": "2022-03-14 13:01:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07065v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Phases of MANES: Multi-Asset Non-Equilibrium Skew Model of a Strongly Non-Linear Market with Phase Transitions", "abstract": "This paper presents an analytically tractable and practically-oriented model of non-linear dynamics of a multi-asset market in the limit of a large number of assets. The asset price dynamics are driven by money flows into the market from external investors, and their price impact. This leads to a model of a market as an ensemble of interacting non-linear oscillators with the Langevin dynamics. In a homogeneous portfolio approximation, the mean field treatment of the resulting Langevin dynamics produces the McKean-Vlasov equation as a dynamic equation for market returns. Due to the strong non-linearity of the McKean-Vlasov equation, the resulting dynamics give rise to ergodicity breaking and first- or second-order phase transitions under variations of model parameters. Using a tractable potential of the Non-Equilibrium Skew (NES) model previously suggested by the author for a single-stock case, the new Multi-Asset NES (MANES) model enables an analytically tractable framework for a multi-asset market. The equilibrium expected market log-return is obtained as a self-consistent mean field of the McKean-Vlasov equation, and derived in closed form in terms of parameters that are inferred from market prices of S&P 500 index options. The model is able to accurately fit the market data for either a benign or distressed market environments, while using only a single volatility parameter.", "published": "2022-03-14 23:25:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07550v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "nlin.AO", "physics.data-an", "q-fin.GN", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Calibration of Derivative Pricing Models: a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Perspective", "abstract": "One of the most fundamental questions in quantitative finance is the existence of continuous-time diffusion models that fit market prices of a given set of options. Traditionally, one employs a mix of intuition, theoretical and empirical analysis to find models that achieve exact or approximate fits. Our contribution is to show how a suitable game theoretical formulation of this problem can help solve this question by leveraging existing developments in modern deep multi-agent reinforcement learning to search in the space of stochastic processes. Our experiments show that we are able to learn local volatility, as well as path-dependence required in the volatility process to minimize the price of a Bermudan option.
