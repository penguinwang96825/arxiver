{"title": "Multi-Fidelity Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization: An Output Space Entropy Search Approach", "abstract": "We study the novel problem of blackbox optimization of multiple objectives via multi-fidelity function evaluations that vary in the amount of resources consumed and their accuracy. The overall goal is to approximate the true Pareto set of solutions by minimizing the resources consumed for function evaluations. For example, in power system design optimization, we need to find designs that trade-off cost, size, efficiency, and thermal tolerance using multi-fidelity simulators for design evaluations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach referred as Multi-Fidelity Output Space Entropy Search for Multi-objective Optimization (MF-OSEMO) to solve this problem. The key idea is to select the sequence of candidate input and fidelity-vector pairs that maximize the information gained about the true Pareto front per unit resource cost. Our experiments on several synthetic and real-world benchmark problems show that MF-OSEMO, with both approximations, significantly improves over the state-of-the-art single-fidelity algorithms for multi-objective optimization.", "published": "2020-11-02 06:59:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01542v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "A Curious New Result of Resolution Strategies in Negation-Limited Inverters Problem", "abstract": "Generally, negation-limited inverters problem is known as a puzzle of constructing an inverter with AND gates and OR gates and a few inverters. In this paper, we introduce a curious new result about the effectiveness of two powerful ATP (Automated Theorem Proving) strategies on tackling negation limited inverter problem. Two resolution strategies are UR (Unit Resulting) resolution and hyper-resolution. In experiment, we come two kinds of automated circuit construction: 3 input/output inverters and 4 input/output BCD Counter Circuit. Both circuits are constructed with a few limited inverters. Curiously, it has been turned out that UR resolution is drastically faster than hyper-resolution in the measurement of the size of SOS (Set of Support). Besides, we discuss the syntactic and semantic criteria which might causes considerable difference of computation cost between UR resolution and hyper-resolution.", "published": "2020-11-02 06:52:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00775v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Competition in Fund Management and Forward Relative Performance Criteria", "abstract": "In an Ito-diffusion market, two fund managers trade under relative performance concerns. For both the asset specialization and diversification settings, we analyze the passive and competitive cases. We measure the performance of the managers' strategies via forward relative performance criteria, leading to the respective notions of forward best-response criterion and forward Nash equilibrium. The motivation to develop such criteria comes from the need to relax various crucial, but quite stringent, existing assumptions -- such as, the a priori choices of both the market model and the investment horizon, the commonality of the latter for both managers as well as the full a priori knowledge of the competitor's policies for the best-response case. We focus on locally riskless criteria and deduce the random forward equations. We solve the CRRA cases, thus also extending the related results in the classical setting. An important by-product of the work herein is the development of forward performance criteria for investment problems in Ito-diffusion markets under the presence of correlated random endowment process for both the perfectly and the incomplete market cases.", "published": "2020-11-02 09:14:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00838v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
{"title": "Adversarial training for predictive tasks: theoretical analysis and limitations in the deterministic case", "abstract": "To train a deep neural network to mimic the outcomes of processing sequences, a version of Conditional Generalized Adversarial Network (CGAN) can be used. It has been observed by others that CGAN can help to improve the results even for deterministic sequences, where only one output is associated with the processing of a given input. Surprisingly, our CGAN-based tests on deterministic geophysical processing sequences did not produce a real improvement compared to the use of an $L_p$ loss; we here propose a first theoretical explanation why. Our analysis goes from the non-deterministic case to the deterministic one. It led us to develop an adversarial way to train a content loss that gave better results on our data.", "published": "2020-11-02 09:05:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00835v3", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Soft Attention Convolutional Neural Networks for Rare Event Detection in Sequences", "abstract": "Automated event detection in the sequences is an important aspect of temporal data analytics. The events can be in the form of peaks, changes in data distribution, changes of spectral characteristics etc. In this work, we propose a Soft-Attention Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for rare event detection in sequences. For the purpose of demonstration, we experiment with well logs where we aim to detect events depicting the changes in the geological layers (a.k.a. well tops/markers). Well logs (single or multivariate) are inputted to a soft attention CNN and a model is trained to locate the marker position. Attention mechanism enables the machine to relatively scale the relevant log features for the task. Experimental results show that our approach is able to locate the rare events with high precision.", "published": "2020-11-02 18:13:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02338v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Centre of pressure estimation during walking using only inertial-measurement units and end-to-end statistical modelling", "abstract": "Estimation of the centre of pressure (COP) is an important part of the gait analysis, for example, when evaluating the functional capacity of individuals affected by motor impairment. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) and force sensors are commonly used to measure gait characteristic of healthy and impaired subjects. We present a methodology for estimating the COP solely from raw gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data from IMUs using statistical modelling. We demonstrate the viability of the method using an example of two models: a linear model and a non-linear Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. Models were trained on the COP ground truth data measured using an instrumented treadmill and achieved the average intra-subject root mean square (RMS) error between estimated and ground truth COP of 12.3mm and the average inter-subject RMS error of 23.7mm which is comparable or better than similar studies so far. We show that the calibration procedure in the instrumented treadmill can be as short as a couple of minutes without the decrease in our model performance. We also show that the magnetic component of the recorded IMU signal, which is most sensitive to environmental changes, can be safely dropped without a significant decrease in model performance. Finally, we show that the number of IMUs can be reduced to five without deterioration in the model performance.", "published": "2020-11-02 20:46:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01303v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
