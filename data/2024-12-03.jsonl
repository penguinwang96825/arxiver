It explores how SEC interventions influence asset\nreturns and trading volumes, focusing on explicitly named crypto assets. The\nempirical analysis highlights significant adverse market reactions, notably\nreturns plummeting 12% over one week post-announcement, persisting for a month.\nWe demonstrate that the severity of market reaction depends on sentiment and\nasset characteristics such as market size, age, volatility, and illiquidity.\nFurther, we identify significant ex-ante trading volume effects indicative of\npre-announcement informed trading.", "published": "2024-12-03 13:38:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02452v1", "categories": ["q-fin.GN", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR", "91G15, 91G30, 91G45, 91G70, 62P20", "K.4.1; I.6.5"], "primary_category": "q-fin.GN"}
