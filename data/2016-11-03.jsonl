{"title": "An empirical study for Vietnamese dependency parsing", "abstract": "This paper presents an empirical comparison of different dependency parsers\nfor Vietnamese, which has some unusual characteristics such as copula drop and\nverb serialization. Experimental results show that the neural network-based\nparsers perform significantly better than the traditional parsers. We report\nthe highest parsing scores published to date for Vietnamese with the labeled\nattachment score (LAS) at 73.53% and the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) at\n80.66%.", "published": "2016-11-03 13:14:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00995v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "CogALex-V Shared Task: ROOT18", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe ROOT 18, a classifier using the scores of several\nunsupervised distributional measures as features to discriminate between\nsemantically related and unrelated words, and then to classify the related\npairs according to their semantic relation (i.e. synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy,\npart-whole meronymy). Our classifier participated in the CogALex-V Shared Task,\nshowing a solid performance on the first subtask, but a poor performance on the\nsecond subtask. The low scores reported on the second subtask suggest that\ndistributional measures are not sufficient to discriminate between multiple\nsemantic relations at once.", "published": "2016-11-03 17:41:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01101v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Binary Paragraph Vectors", "abstract": "Recently Le & Mikolov described two log-linear models, called Paragraph\nVector, that can be used to learn state-of-the-art distributed representations\nof documents. Inspired by this work, we present Binary Paragraph Vector models:\nsimple neural networks that learn short binary codes for fast information\nretrieval. We show that binary paragraph vectors outperform autoencoder-based\nbinary codes, despite using fewer bits. We also evaluate their precision in\ntransfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents\nunrelated to the training corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that\nbinary paragraph vectors can capture semantics relevant for various\ndomain-specific documents. Finally, we present a model that simultaneously\nlearns short binary codes and longer, real-valued representations. This model\ncan be used to rapidly retrieve a short list of highly relevant documents from\na large document collection.", "published": "2016-11-03 18:10:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01116v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
