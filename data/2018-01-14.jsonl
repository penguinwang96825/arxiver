{"title": "DCDistance: A Supervised Text Document Feature extraction based on class\n  labels", "abstract": "Text Mining is a field that aims at extracting information from textual data.\nOne of the challenges of such field of study comes from the pre-processing\nstage in which a vector (and structured) representation should be extracted\nfrom unstructured data. The common extraction creates large and sparse vectors\nrepresenting the importance of each term to a document. As such, this usually\nleads to the curse-of-dimensionality that plagues most machine learning\nalgorithms. To cope with this issue, in this paper we propose a new supervised\nfeature extraction and reduction algorithm, named DCDistance, that creates\nfeatures based on the distance between a document to a representative of each\nclass label. As such, the proposed technique can reduce the features set in\nmore than 99% of the original set. Additionally, this algorithm was also\ncapable of improving the classification accuracy over a set of benchmark\ndatasets when compared to traditional and state-of-the-art features selection\nalgorithms.", "published": "2018-01-14 13:28:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04554v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
