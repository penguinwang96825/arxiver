{"title": "Stance detection in online discussions", "abstract": "This paper describes our system created to detect stance in online\ndiscussions. The goal is to identify whether the author of a comment is in\nfavor of the given target or against. Our approach is based on a maximum\nentropy classifier, which uses surface-level, sentiment and domain-specific\nfeatures. The system was originally developed to detect stance in English\ntweets. We adapted it to process Czech news commentaries.", "published": "2017-01-02 19:23:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00504v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
