{"title": "Contextual Semantic Parsing using Crowdsourced Spatial Descriptions", "abstract": "We describe a contextual parser for the Robot Commands Treebank, a new\ncrowdsourced resource. In contrast to previous semantic parsers that select the\nmost-probable parse, we consider the different problem of parsing using\nadditional situational context to disambiguate between different readings of a\nsentence. We show that multiple semantic analyses can be searched using dynamic\nprogramming via interaction with a spatial planner, to guide the parsing\nprocess. We are able to parse sentences in near linear-time by ruling out\nanalyses early on that are incompatible with spatial context. We report a 34%\nupper bound on accuracy, as our planner correctly processes spatial context for\n3,394 out of 10,000 sentences. However, our parser achieves a 96.53%\nexact-match score for parsing within the subset of sentences recognized by the\nplanner, compared to 82.14% for a non-contextual parser.", "published": "2014-05-01 12:29:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0145v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
