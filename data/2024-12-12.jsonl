{"title": "Geometric Deep Learning for Realized Covariance Matrix Forecasting", "abstract": "Traditional methods employed in matrix volatility forecasting often overlook\nthe inherent Riemannian manifold structure of symmetric positive definite\nmatrices, treating them as elements of Euclidean space, which can lead to\nsuboptimal predictive performance. Moreover, they often struggle to handle\nhigh-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\nforecasting realized covariance matrices of asset returns using a\nRiemannian-geometry-aware deep learning framework. In this way, we account for\nthe geometric properties of the covariance matrices, including possible\nnon-linear dynamics and efficient handling of high-dimensionality. Moreover,\nbuilding upon a Fr\\'echet sample mean of realized covariance matrices, we are\nable to extend the HAR model to the matrix-variate. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our approach using daily realized covariance matrices for the 50 most\ncapitalized companies in the S&P 500 index, showing that our method outperforms\ntraditional approaches in terms of predictive accuracy.", "published": "2024-12-12 18:01:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09517v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "econ.EM", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

{"title": "Robust mean-variance stochastic differential reinsurance and investment games under volatility risk and model uncertainty", "abstract": "This paper investigates robust stochastic differential games among insurers\nunder model uncertainty and stochastic volatility. The surplus processes of\nambiguity-averse insurers (AAIs) are characterized by drifted Brownian motion\nwith both common and idiosyncratic insurance risks. To mitigate these risks,\nAAIs can purchase proportional reinsurance. Besides, AAIs allocate their wealth\nin a financial market consisting of cash, and a stock characterized by the 4/2\nstochastic volatility model. AAIs compete with each other based on relative\nperformance with the mean-variance criterion under the worst-case scenario.\nThis paper formulates a robust time-consistent mean-field game in a non-linear\nsystem. The AAIs seek robust, time-consistent response strategies to achieve\nNash equilibrium strategies in the game. We introduce $n$-dimensional extended\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equations and corresponding verification\ntheorems under compatible conditions. Semi-closed forms of the robust\n$n$-insurer equilibrium and mean-field equilibrium are derived, relying on\ncoupled Riccati equations. Suitable conditions are presented to ensure the\nexistence and uniqueness of the coupled Riccati equation as well as the\nintegrability in the verification theorem. As the number of AAIs increases, the\nresults in the $n$-insurer game converge to those in the mean-field game.\nNumerical examples are provided to illustrate economic behaviors in the games,\nhighlighting the herd effect of competition on the AAIs.", "published": "2024-12-12 11:02:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09171v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Many-insurer robust games of reinsurance and investment under model uncertainty in incomplete markets", "abstract": "This paper studies the robust reinsurance and investment games for\ncompetitive insurers. Model uncertainty is characterized by a class of\nequivalent probability measures. Each insurer is concerned with relative\nperformance under the worst-case scenario. Insurers' surplus processes are\napproximated by drifted Brownian motion with common and idiosyncratic insurance\nrisks. The insurers can purchase proportional reinsurance to divide the\ninsurance risk with the reinsurance premium calculated by the variance\nprinciple. We consider an incomplete market driven by the 4/2 stochastic\nvolatility mode. This paper formulates the robust mean-field game for a\nnon-linear system originating from the variance principle and the 4/2 model.\nFor the case of an exponential utility function, we derive closed-form\nsolutions for the $n$-insurer game and the corresponding mean-field game. We\nshow that relative concerns lead to new hedging terms in the investment and\nreinsurance strategies. Model uncertainty can significantly change the\ninsurers' hedging demands. The hedging demands in the investment-reinsurance\nstrategies exhibit highly non-linear dependence with the insurers' competitive\ncoefficients, risk aversion and ambiguity aversion coefficients. Finally,\nnumerical results demonstrate the herd effect of competition.", "published": "2024-12-12 10:44:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09157v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
