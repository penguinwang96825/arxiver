{"title": "Linear models and linear mixed effects models in R with linguistic\n  applications", "abstract": "This text is a conceptual introduction to mixed effects modeling with\nlinguistic applications, using the R programming environment. The reader is\nintroduced to linear modeling and assumptions, as well as to mixed\neffects/multilevel modeling, including a discussion of random intercepts,\nrandom slopes and likelihood ratio tests. The example used throughout the text\nfocuses on the phonetic analysis of voice pitch data.", "published": "2013-08-26 07:18:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5499v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
