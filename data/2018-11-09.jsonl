{"title": "A note on simultaneous representation problem for interval and circular-arc graphs", "abstract": "In this short note, we show two NP-completeness results regarding the \\emph{simultaneous representation problem}, introduced by Lubiw and Jampani. The simultaneous representation problem for a given class of intersection graphs asks if some $k$ graphs can be represented so that every vertex is represented by the same interval in each representation. We prove that it is NP-complete to decide this for the class of interval and circular-arc graphs in the case when $k$ is a part of the input and graphs are not in a sunflower position.", "published": "2018-11-09 18:43:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04062v2", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
