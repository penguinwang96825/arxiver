{"title": "A QUBO Framework for Team Formation", "abstract": "The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each\nexpert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is\nto find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while\nsimultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different\ndefinitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and\nalgorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that\ncaptures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task\ncoverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation\nvariants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution\nmethods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation\nproblems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines.\nFurthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks\ncan effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer\nlearning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently\napplied to another.", "published": "2025-03-29 20:18:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DM", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "A convergence technique for the game i-Mark", "abstract": "The game of i-Mark is an impartial combinatorial game introduced by Sopena\n(2016). The game is parametrized by two sets of positive integers $S$, $D$,\nwhere $\\min D\\ge 2$. From position $n\\ge 0$ one can move to any position $n-s$,\n$s\\in S$, as long as $n-s\\ge 0$, as well as to any position $n/d$, $d\\in D$, as\nlong as $n>0$ and $d$ divides $n$. The game ends when no more moves are\npossible, and the last player to move is the winner. Sopena, and subsequently\nFriman and Nivasch (2021), characterized the Sprague-Grundy sequences of many\ncases of i-Mark$(S,D)$ with $|D|=1$. Friman and Nivasch also obtained some\npartial results for the case i-Mark$(\\{1\\},\\{2,3\\})$.\n  In this paper we present a convergence technique that gives polynomial-time\nalgorithms for the Sprague-Grundy sequence of many instances of i-Mark with\n$|D|>1$. In particular, we prove our technique works for all games\ni-Mark$(\\{1\\},\\{d_1,d_2\\})$.\n  Keywords: Combinatorial game, impartial game, Sprague-Grundy function,\nconvergence, dynamic programming.", "published": "2025-03-29 19:32:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23196v1", "categories": ["math.CO", "cs.DM", "91A46"], "primary_category": "math.CO"}
{"title": "EncGPT: A Multi-Agent Workflow for Dynamic Encryption Algorithms", "abstract": "Communication encryption is crucial in computer technology, but existing\nalgorithms struggle with balancing cost and security. We propose EncGPT, a\nmulti-agent framework using large language models (LLM). It includes rule,\nencryption, and decryption agents that generate encryption rules and apply them\ndynamically.
