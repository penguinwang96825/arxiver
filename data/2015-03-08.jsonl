{"title": "An Unsupervised Method for Uncovering Morphological Chains", "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art systems today produce morphological analysis based only\non orthographic patterns. In contrast, we propose a model for unsupervised\nmorphological analysis that integrates orthographic and semantic views of\nwords. We model word formation in terms of morphological chains, from base\nwords to the observed words, breaking the chains into parent-child relations.\nWe use log-linear models with morpheme and word-level features to predict\npossible parents, including their modifications, for each word. The limited set\nof candidate parents for each word render contrastive estimation feasible. Our\nmodel consistently matches or outperforms five state-of-the-art systems on\nArabic, English and Turkish.", "published": "2015-03-08 22:18:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02335v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
