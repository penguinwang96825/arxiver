{"title": "Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks for Addressing Data Imbalance in Financial Market Supervision", "abstract": "This study explores the application of generative adversarial networks in\nfinancial market supervision, especially for solving the problem of data\nimbalance to improve the accuracy of risk prediction. Since financial market\ndata are often imbalanced, especially high-risk events such as market\nmanipulation and systemic risk occur less frequently, traditional models have\ndifficulty effectively identifying these minority events. This study proposes\nto generate synthetic data with similar characteristics to these minority\nevents through GAN to balance the dataset, thereby improving the prediction\nperformance of the model in financial supervision. Experimental results show\nthat compared with traditional oversampling and undersampling methods, the data\ngenerated by GAN has significant advantages in dealing with imbalance problems\nand improving the prediction accuracy of the model. This method has broad\napplication potential in financial regulatory agencies such as the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority (FINRA), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the\nFederal Reserve.", "published": "2024-12-04 08:06:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15222v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Hidden Markov graphical models with state-dependent generalized hyperbolic distributions", "abstract": "In this paper we develop a novel hidden Markov graphical model to investigate\ntime-varying interconnectedness between different financial markets. To\nidentify conditional correlation structures under varying market conditions and\naccommodate stylized facts embedded in financial time series, we rely upon the\ngeneralized hyperbolic family of distributions with time-dependent parameters\nevolving according to a latent Markov chain. We exploit its location-scale\nmixture representation to build a penalized EM algorithm for estimating the\nstate-specific sparse precision matrices by means of an $L_1$ penalty. The\nproposed approach leads to regime-specific conditional correlation graphs that\nallow us to identify different degrees of network connectivity of returns over\ntime. The methodology's effectiveness is validated through simulation exercises\nunder different scenarios. In the empirical analysis we apply our model to\ndaily returns of a large set of market indexes, cryptocurrencies and commodity\nfutures over the period 2017-2023.", "published": "2024-12-04 19:01:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03668v1", "categories": ["stat.ME", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "stat.ME"}
