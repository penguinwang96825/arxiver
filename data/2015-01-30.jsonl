{"title": "Towards Resolving Software Quality-in-Use Measurement Challenges", "abstract": "Software quality-in-use comprehends the quality from user's perspectives. It\nhas gained its importance in e-learning applications, mobile service based\napplications and project management tools. User's decisions on software\nacquisitions are often ad hoc or based on preference due to difficulty in\nquantitatively measure software quality-in-use. However, why quality-in-use\nmeasurement is difficult? Although there are many software quality models to\nour knowledge, no works surveys the challenges related to software\nquality-in-use measurement. This paper has two main contributions; 1) presents\nmajor issues and challenges in measuring software quality-in-use in the context\nof the ISO SQuaRE series and related software quality models, 2) Presents a\nnovel framework that can be used to predict software quality-in-use, and 3)\npresents preliminary results of quality-in-use topic prediction. Concisely, the\nissues are related to the complexity of the current standard models and the\nlimitations and incompleteness of the customized software quality models. The\nproposed framework employs sentiment analysis techniques to predict software\nquality-in-use.", "published": "2015-01-30 06:51:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07676v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
