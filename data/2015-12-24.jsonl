{"title": "Service Choreography, SBVR, and Time", "abstract": "We propose the use of structured natural language (English) in specifying\nservice choreographies, focusing on the what rather than the how of the\nrequired coordination of participant services in realising a business\napplication scenario. The declarative approach we propose uses the OMG standard\nSemantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) as a modelling language. The\nservice choreography approach has been proposed for describing the global\norderings of the invocations on interfaces of participant services. We\ntherefore extend SBVR with a notion of time which can capture the coordination\nof the participant services, in terms of the observable message exchanges\nbetween them. The extension is done using existing modelling constructs in\nSBVR, and hence respects the standard specification. The idea is that users -\ndomain specialists rather than implementation specialists - can verify the\nrequested service composition by directly reading the structured English used\nby SBVR. At the same time, the SBVR model can be represented in formal logic so\nit can be parsed and executed by a machine.", "published": "2015-12-24 01:40:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07685v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
