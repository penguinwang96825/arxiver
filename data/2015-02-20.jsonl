{"title": "Web Similarity in Sets of Search Terms using Database Queries", "abstract": "Normalized web distance (NWD) is a similarity or normalized semantic distance\nbased on the World Wide Web or another large electronic database, for instance\nWikipedia, and a search engine that returns reliable aggregate page counts. For\nsets of search terms the NWD gives a common similarity (common semantics) on a\nscale from 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different). The NWD approximates the\nsimilarity of members of a set according to all (upper semi)computable\nproperties. We develop the theory and give applications of classifying using\nAmazon, Wikipedia, and the NCBI website from the National Institutes of Health.\nThe last gives new correlations between health hazards. A restriction of the\nNWD to a set of two yields the earlier normalized google distance (NGD) but no\ncombination of the NGD's of pairs in a set can extract the information the NWD\nextracts from the set. The NWD enables a new contextual (different databases)\nlearning approachbased on Kolmogorov complexity theory that incorporates\nknowledge from these databases.", "published": "2015-02-20 17:55:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05957v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
