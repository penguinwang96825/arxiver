{"title": "Rational Kernels for Arabic Stemming and Text Classification", "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problems of Arabic Text Classification and\nstemming using Transducers and Rational Kernels. We introduce a new stemming\ntechnique based on the use of Arabic patterns (Pattern Based Stemmer). Patterns\nare modelled using transducers and stemming is done without depending on any\ndictionary. Using transducers for stemming, documents are transformed into\nfinite state transducers. This document representation allows us to use and\nexplore rational kernels as a framework for Arabic Text Classification.\nStemming experiments are conducted on three word collections and classification\nexperiments are done on the Saudi Press Agency dataset. Results show that our\napproach, when compared with other approaches, is promising specially in terms\nof Accuracy, Recall and F1.", "published": "2015-02-26 11:09:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07504v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
