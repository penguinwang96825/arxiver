{"title": "Unified Performance Analysis of Hybrid FSO/RF System with Diversity Combining", "abstract": "Hybrid free space optical (FSO)/radio frequency (RF) systems have been proved to be reliable links for high-data-rate wireless backhauls. In this paper, we present a unified performance analysis of the hybrid FSO/RF transmission system which transmits the identical data in both links and implements two popular diversity combining schemes, namely, selection combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC), in the receiver. Specially, for the FSO link, the Gamma-Gamma turbulence with pointing errors under heterodyne detection (HD) and intensity modulation/direction detection (IM/DD) is considered in our analysis while the general \\k{appa}-\u03bc shadowed fading which unifies popular RF fading models is employed for the analysis of the RF link. As a result, unified closed-form expressions of outage probabilities and average bit error rates for different modulation schemes are derived. Analytical and Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to characterize the performance of the hybrid FSO/RF link which is compared to the single FSO link and the single RF link. The agreement between the analytical and simulation results confirms the unification of various FSO channels and RF fading scenarios into a single closed-form expression.", "published": "2020-04-04 06:40:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01873v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Beyond D2D: Full Dimension UAV-to-Everything Communications in 6G", "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over cellular networks, where UAVs work as aerial users to collect various sensory data, and send the collected data to their transmission destinations over cellular links. Unlike the terrestrial users in the conventional cellular networks, different UAVs have various communication requirements due to their sensing applications, and a more flexible communication framework is in demand. To tackle this problem, we propose a UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networking, which enables the UAVs to adjust their communication modes full dimensionally according to the requirements of their sensing applications. In this article, we first introduce the concept of U2X communications, and elaborate on its three communication modes. Afterwards, we discuss the key techniques of the U2X communications, including joint sensing and transmission protocol, UAV trajectory design, and radio resource management. A reinforcement learning-based mathematical framework for U2X communications is then proposed. Finally, the extensions of the U2X communications are presented.", "published": "2020-04-04 12:44:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01920v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.NI"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
