{"title": "Comparative Analysis of LSTM, GRU, and Transformer Models for Stock Price Prediction", "abstract": "In recent fast-paced financial markets, investors constantly seek ways to\ngain an edge and make informed decisions. Although achieving perfect accuracy\nin stock price predictions remains elusive, artificial intelligence (AI)\nadvancements have significantly enhanced our ability to analyze historical data\nand identify potential trends. This paper takes AI driven stock price trend\nprediction as the core research, makes a model training data set of famous\nTesla cars from 2015 to 2024, and compares LSTM, GRU, and Transformer Models.\nThe analysis is more consistent with the model of stock trend prediction, and\nthe experimental results show that the accuracy of the LSTM model is 94%. These\nmethods ultimately allow investors to make more informed decisions and gain a\nclearer insight into market behaviors.", "published": "2024-10-20 14:00:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05790v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
