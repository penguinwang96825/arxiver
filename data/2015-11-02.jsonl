{"title": "Automatic Prosody Prediction for Chinese Speech Synthesis using\n  BLSTM-RNN and Embedding Features", "abstract": "Prosody affects the naturalness and intelligibility of speech. However,\nautomatic prosody prediction from text for Chinese speech synthesis is still a\ngreat challenge and the traditional conditional random fields (CRF) based\nmethod always heavily relies on feature engineering. In this paper, we propose\nto use neural networks to predict prosodic boundary labels directly from\nChinese characters without any feature engineering. Experimental results show\nthat stacking feed-forward and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)\nrecurrent network layers achieves superior performance over the CRF-based\nmethod. The embedding features learned from raw text further enhance the\nperformance.", "published": "2015-11-02 02:34:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00360v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Spatial Semantic Scan: Jointly Detecting Subtle Events and their Spatial\n  Footprint", "abstract": "Many methods have been proposed for detecting emerging events in text streams\nusing topic modeling. However, these methods have shortcomings that make them\nunsuitable for rapid detection of locally emerging events on massive text\nstreams. We describe Spatially Compact Semantic Scan (SCSS) that has been\ndeveloped specifically to overcome the shortcomings of current methods in\ndetecting new spatially compact events in text streams. SCSS employs\nalternating optimization between using semantic scan to estimate contrastive\nforeground topics in documents, and discovering spatial neighborhoods with high\noccurrence of documents containing the foreground topics. We evaluate our\nmethod on Emergency Department chief complaints dataset (ED dataset) to verify\nthe effectiveness of our method in detecting real-world disease outbreaks from\nfree-text ED chief complaint data.", "published": "2015-11-02 01:45:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00352v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
