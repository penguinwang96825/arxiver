{"title": "Entities as topic labels: Improving topic interpretability and\n  evaluability combining Entity Linking and Labeled LDA", "abstract": "In order to create a corpus exploration method providing topics that are\neasier to interpret than standard LDA topic models, here we propose combining\ntwo techniques called Entity linking and Labeled LDA. Our method identifies in\nan ontology a series of descriptive labels for each document in a corpus. Then\nit generates a specific topic for each label. Having a direct relation between\ntopics and labels makes interpretation easier; using an ontology as background\nknowledge limits label ambiguity. As our topics are described with a limited\nnumber of clear-cut labels, they promote interpretability, and this may help\nquantitative evaluation. We illustrate the potential of the approach by\napplying it in order to define the most relevant topics addressed by each party\nin the European Parliament's fifth mandate (1999-2004).", "published": "2016-04-26 19:31:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07809v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
