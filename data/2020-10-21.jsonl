{"title": "ProphetNet-Ads: A Looking Ahead Strategy for Generative Retrieval Models in Sponsored Search Engine", "abstract": "In a sponsored search engine, generative retrieval models are recently proposed to mine relevant advertisement keywords for users' input queries. Generative retrieval models generate outputs token by token on a path of the target library prefix tree (Trie), which guarantees all of the generated outputs are legal and covered by the target library. In actual use, we found several typical problems caused by Trie-constrained searching length. In this paper, we analyze these problems and propose a looking ahead strategy for generative retrieval models named ProphetNet-Ads. ProphetNet-Ads improves the retrieval ability by directly optimizing the Trie-constrained searching space. We build a dataset from a real-word sponsored search engine and carry out experiments to analyze different generative retrieval models. Compared with Trie-based LSTM generative retrieval model proposed recently, our single model result and integrated result improve the recall by 15.58\\% and 18.8\\% respectively with beam size 5. Case studies further demonstrate how these problems are alleviated by ProphetNet-Ads clearly.", "published": "2020-10-21 07:03:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10789v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Explaining black-box text classifiers for disease-treatment information extraction", "abstract": "Deep neural networks and other intricate Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have reached high levels of accuracy on many biomedical natural language processing tasks. However, their applicability in real-world use cases may be limited due to their vague inner working and decision logic. A post-hoc explanation method can approximate the behavior of a black-box AI model by extracting relationships between feature values and outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a post-hoc explanation method that utilizes confident itemsets to approximate the behavior of black-box classifiers for medical information extraction. Incorporating medical concepts and semantics into the explanation process, our explanator finds semantic relations between inputs and outputs in different parts of the decision space of a black-box classifier. The experimental results show that our explanation method can outperform perturbation and decision set based explanators in terms of fidelity and interpretability of explanations produced for predictions on a disease-treatment information extraction task.", "published": "2020-10-21 09:58:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10873v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

{"title": "Learning from Heterogeneous EEG Signals with Differentiable Channel Reordering", "abstract": "We propose CHARM, a method for training a single neural network across inconsistent input channels. Our work is motivated by Electroencephalography (EEG), where data collection protocols from different headsets result in varying channel ordering and number, which limits the feasibility of transferring trained systems across datasets. Our approach builds upon attention mechanisms to estimate a latent reordering matrix from each input signal and map input channels to a canonical order. CHARM is differentiable and can be composed further with architectures expecting a consistent channel ordering to build end-to-end trainable classifiers. We perform experiments on four EEG classification datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of CHARM via simulated shuffling and masking of input channels. Moreover, our method improves the transfer of pre-trained representations between datasets collected with different protocols.", "published": "2020-10-21 12:32:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13694v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
