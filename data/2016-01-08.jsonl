{"title": "Research Project: Text Engineering Tool for Ontological Scientometry", "abstract": "The number of scientific papers grows exponentially in many disciplines. The\nshare of online available papers grows as well. At the same time, the period of\ntime for a paper to loose at chance to be cited anymore shortens. The decay of\nthe citing rate shows similarity to ultradiffusional processes as for other\nonline contents in social networks. The distribution of papers per author shows\nsimilarity to the distribution of posts per user in social networks. The rate\nof uncited papers for online available papers grows while some papers 'go\nviral' in terms of being cited. Summarized, the practice of scientific\npublishing moves towards the domain of social networks. The goal of this\nproject is to create a text engineering tool, which can semi-automatically\ncategorize a paper according to its type of contribution and extract\nrelationships between them into an ontological database. Semi-automatic\ncategorization means that the mistakes made by automatic pre-categorization and\nrelationship-extraction will be corrected through a wikipedia-like front-end by\nvolunteers from general public. This tool should not only help researchers and\nthe general public to find relevant supplementary material and peers faster,\nbut also provide more information for research funding agencies.", "published": "2016-01-08 14:29:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01887v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
