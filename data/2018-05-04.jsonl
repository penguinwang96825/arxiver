{"title": "Cross-lingual Candidate Search for Biomedical Concept Normalization", "abstract": "Biomedical concept normalization links concept mentions in texts to a\nsemantically equivalent concept in a biomedical knowledge base. This task is\nchallenging as concepts can have different expressions in natural languages,\ne.g. paraphrases, which are not necessarily all present in the knowledge base.\nConcept normalization of non-English biomedical text is even more challenging\nas non-English resources tend to be much smaller and contain less synonyms. To\novercome the limitations of non-English terminologies we propose a\ncross-lingual candidate search for concept normalization using a\ncharacter-based neural translation model trained on a multilingual biomedical\nterminology. Our model is trained with Spanish, French, Dutch and German\nversions of UMLS. The evaluation of our model is carried out on the French\nQuaero corpus, showing that it outperforms most teams of CLEF eHealth 2015 and\n2016. Additionally, we compare performance to commercial translators on\nSpanish, French, Dutch and German versions of Mantra. Our model performs\nsimilarly well, but is free of charge and can be run locally. This is\nparticularly important for clinical NLP applications as medical documents\nunderlay strict privacy restrictions.", "published": "2018-05-04 08:11:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01646v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Upping the Ante: Towards a Better Benchmark for Chinese-to-English\n  Machine Translation", "abstract": "There are many machine translation (MT) papers that propose novel approaches\nand show improvements over their self-defined baselines. The experimental\nsetting in each paper often differs from one another. As such, it is hard to\ndetermine if a proposed approach is really useful and advances the state of the\nart. Chinese-to-English translation is a common translation direction in MT\npapers, although there is not one widely accepted experimental setting in\nChinese-to-English MT. Our goal in this paper is to propose a benchmark in\nevaluation setup for Chinese-to-English machine translation, such that the\neffectiveness of a new proposed MT approach can be directly compared to\nprevious approaches. Towards this end, we also built a highly competitive\nstate-of-the-art MT system trained on a large-scale training set. Our system\noutperforms reported results on NIST OpenMT test sets in almost all papers\npublished in major conferences and journals in computational linguistics and\nartificial intelligence in the past 11 years. We argue that a standardized\nbenchmark on data and performance is important for meaningful comparison.", "published": "2018-05-04 09:22:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01676v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Extreme Adaptation for Personalized Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Every person speaks or writes their own flavor of their native language,\ninfluenced by a number of factors: the content they tend to talk about, their\ngender, their social status, or their geographical origin.\n  When attempting to perform Machine Translation (MT), these variations have a\nsignificant effect on how the system should perform translation, but this is\nnot captured well by standard one-size-fits-all models.\n  In this paper, we propose a simple and parameter-efficient adaptation\ntechnique that only requires adapting the bias of the output softmax to each\nparticular user of the MT system, either directly or through a factored\napproximation.\n  Experiments on TED talks in three languages demonstrate improvements in\ntranslation accuracy, and better reflection of speaker traits in the target\ntext.", "published": "2018-05-04 15:07:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01817v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Rank-Based Similarity Metric for Word Embeddings", "abstract": "Word Embeddings have recently imposed themselves as a standard for\nrepresenting word meaning in NLP.

{"title": "When Politicians Talk About Politics: Identifying Political Tweets of\n  Brazilian Congressmen", "abstract": "Since June 2013, when Brazil faced the largest and most significant mass\nprotests in a generation, a political crisis is in course. In midst of this\ncrisis, Brazilian politicians use social media to communicate with the\nelectorate in order to retain or to grow their political capital. The problem\nis that many controversial topics are in course and deputies may prefer to\navoid such themes in their messages. To characterize this behavior, we propose\na method to accurately identify political and non-political tweets\nindependently of the deputy who posted it and of the time it was posted.\nMoreover, we collected tweets of all congressmen who were active on Twitter and\nworked in the Brazilian parliament from October 2013 to October 2017. To\nevaluate our method, we used word clouds and a topic model to identify the main\npolitical and non-political latent topics in parliamentarian tweets. Both\nresults indicate that our proposal is able to accurately distinguish political\nfrom non-political tweets. Moreover, our analyses revealed a striking fact:\nmore than half of the messages posted by Brazilian deputies are non-political.", "published": "2018-05-04 02:26:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01589v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Facebook Reaction-Based Emotion Classifier as Cue for Sarcasm Detection", "abstract": "Online social media users react to content in them based on context. Emotions\nor mood play a significant part of these reactions, which has filled these\nplatforms with opinionated content. Different approaches and applications to\nmake better use of this data are continuously being developed. However, due to\nthe nature of the data, the variety of platforms, and dynamic online user\nbehavior, there are still many issues to be dealt with. It remains a challenge\nto properly obtain a reliable emotional status from a user prior to posting a\ncomment. This work introduces a methodology that explores semi-supervised\nmultilingual emotion detection based on the overlap of Facebook reactions and\ntextual data. With the resulting emotion detection system we evaluate the\npossibility of using emotions and user behavior features for the task of\nsarcasm detection. More than 1 million English and Chinese comments from over\n62,000 public Facebook pages posts have been collected and processed, conducted\nexperiments show acceptable performance metrics.", "published": "2018-05-04 04:46:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06510v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Convex Approximation of the Relaxed Binaural Beamforming Optimization\n  Problem", "abstract": "The recently proposed relaxed binaural beamforming (RBB) optimization problem\nprovides a flexible trade-off between noise suppression and binaural-cue\npreservation of the sound sources in the acoustic scene. It minimizes the\noutput noise power, under the constraints which guarantee that the target\nremains unchanged after processing and the binaural-cue distortions of the\nacoustic sources will be less than a user-defined threshold. However, the RBB\nproblem is a computationally demanding non-convex optimization problem. The\nonly existing suboptimal method which approximately solves the RBB is a\nsuccessive convex optimization (SCO) method which, typically, requires to solve\nmultiple convex optimization problems per frequency bin, in order to converge.\nConvergence is achieved when all constraints of the RBB optimization problem\nare satisfied. In this paper, we propose a semi-definite convex relaxation\n(SDCR) of the RBB optimization problem. The proposed suboptimal SDCR method\nsolves a single convex optimization problem per frequency bin, resulting in a\nmuch lower computational complexity than the SCO method. Unlike the SCO method,\nthe SDCR method does not guarantee user-controlled upper-bounded binaural-cue\ndistortions. To tackle this problem we also propose a suboptimal hybrid method\nwhich combines the SDCR and SCO methods. Instrumental measures combined with a\nlistening test show that the SDCR and hybrid methods achieve significantly\nlower computational complexity than the SCO method, and in most cases better\ntrade-off between predicted intelligibility and binaural-cue preservation than\nthe SCO method.", "published": "2018-05-04 10:01:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01692v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.IT", "eess.AS", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
