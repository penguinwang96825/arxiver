{"title": "Coloring even-hole-free graphs with no star cutset", "abstract": "A \\emph{hole} is a chordless cycle of length at least $4$. A graph is \\emph{even-hole-free} if it does not contain any hole of even length as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we study the class of even-hole-free graphs with no star cutset. We give the optimal upper bound for its chromatic number in terms of clique number and a polynomial-time algorithm to color any graph in this class. The latter is, in fact, a direct consequence of our proof that this class has bounded rank-width.", "published": "2018-05-04 22:15:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01948v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
