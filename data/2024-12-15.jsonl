{"title": "The AI Black-Scholes: Finance-Informed Neural Network", "abstract": "In the realm of option pricing, existing models are typically classified into\nprinciple-driven methods, such as solving partial differential equations (PDEs)\nthat pricing function satisfies, and data-driven approaches, such as machine\nlearning (ML) techniques that parameterize the pricing function directly. While\nprinciple-driven models offer a rigorous theoretical framework, they often rely\non unrealistic assumptions, such as asset processes adhering to fixed\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs). Moreover, they can become\ncomputationally intensive, particularly in high-dimensional settings when\nanalytical solutions are not available and thus numerical solutions are needed.\nIn contrast, data-driven models excel in capturing market data trends, but they\noften lack alignment with core financial principles, raising concerns about\ninterpretability and predictive accuracy, especially when dealing with limited\nor biased datasets. This work proposes a hybrid approach to address these\nlimitations by integrating the strengths of both principled and data-driven\nmethodologies. Our framework combines the theoretical rigor and\ninterpretability of PDE-based models with the adaptability of machine learning\ntechniques, yielding a more versatile methodology for pricing a broad spectrum\nof options. We validate our approach across different volatility modeling\napproaches-both with constant volatility (Black-Scholes) and stochastic\nvolatility (Heston), demonstrating that our proposed framework,\nFinance-Informed Neural Network (FINN), not only enhances predictive accuracy\nbut also maintains adherence to core financial principles. FINN presents a\npromising tool for practitioners, offering robust performance across a variety\nof market conditions.", "published": "2024-12-15 22:40:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12213v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Simulation of square-root processes made simple: applications to the Heston model", "abstract": "We introduce a simple, efficient and accurate nonnegative preserving\nnumerical scheme for simulating the square-root process. The novel idea is to\nsimulate the integrated square-root process first instead of the square-root\nprocess itself. Numerical experiments on realistic parameter sets, applied for\nthe integrated process and the Heston model, display high precision with a very\nlow number of time steps. As a bonus, our scheme yields the exact limiting\nInverse Gaussian distributions of the integrated square-root process with only\none single time-step in two scenarios: (i) for high mean-reversion and\nvolatility-of-volatility regimes, regardless of maturity; and (ii) for long\nmaturities, independent of the other parameters.", "published": "2024-12-15 17:58:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11264v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "From Votes to Volatility Predicting the Stock Market on Election Day", "abstract": "Stock market forecasting has been a topic of extensive research, aiming to\nprovide investors with optimal stock recommendations for higher returns. In\nrecent years, this field has gained even more attention due to the widespread\nadoption of deep learning models. While these models have achieved impressive\naccuracy in predicting stock behavior, tailoring them to specific scenarios has\nbecome increasingly important. Election Day represents one such critical\nscenario, characterized by intensified market volatility, as the winning\ncandidate's policies significantly impact various economic sectors and\ncompanies. To address this challenge, we propose the Election Day Stock Market\nForecasting (EDSMF) Model. Our approach leverages the contextual capabilities\nof large language models alongside specialized agents designed to analyze the\npolitical and economic consequences of elections. By building on a\nstate-of-the-art architecture, we demonstrate that EDSMF improves the\npredictive performance of the S&P 500 during this uniquely volatile day.", "published": "2024-12-15 13:58:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11192v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "PolyModel for Hedge Funds' Portfolio Construction Using Machine Learning", "abstract": "The domain of hedge fund investments is undergoing significant\ntransformation, influenced by the rapid expansion of data availability and the\nadvancement of analytical technologies. This study explores the enhancement of\nhedge fund investment performance through the integration of machine learning\ntechniques, the application of PolyModel feature selection, and the analysis of\nfund size. We address three critical questions: (1) the effect of machine\nlearning on trading performance, (2) the role of PolyModel feature selection in\nfund selection and performance, and (3) the comparative reliability of larger\nversus smaller funds.\n  Our findings offer compelling insights. We observe that while machine\nlearning techniques enhance cumulative returns, they also increase annual\nvolatility, indicating variability in performance. PolyModel feature selection\nproves to be a robust strategy, with approaches that utilize a comprehensive\nset of features for fund selection outperforming more selective methodologies.\nNotably, Long-Term Stability (LTS) effectively manages portfolio volatility\nwhile delivering favorable returns. Contrary to popular belief, our results\nsuggest that larger funds do not consistently yield better investment outcomes,\nchallenging the assumption of their inherent reliability.\n  This research highlights the transformative impact of data-driven approaches\nin the hedge fund investment arena and provides valuable implications for\ninvestors and asset managers. By leveraging machine learning and PolyModel\nfeature selection, investors can enhance portfolio optimization and reassess\nthe dependability of larger funds, leading to more informed investment\nstrategies.", "published": "2024-12-15 02:22:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11019v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Decoding OTC Government Bond Market Liquidity: An ABM Model for Market Dynamics", "abstract": "The over-the-counter (OTC) government bond markets are characterised by their\nbilateral trading structures, which pose unique challenges to understanding and\nensuring market stability and liquidity. In this paper, we develop a bespoke\nABM that simulates market-maker interactions within a stylised government bond\nmarket. The model focuses on the dynamics of liquidity and stability in the\nsecondary trading of government bonds, particularly in concentrated markets\nlike those found in Australia and the UK. Through this simulation, we test key\nhypotheses around improving market stability, focusing on the effects of agent\ndiversity, business costs, and client base size. We demonstrate that greater\nagent diversity enhances market liquidity and that reducing the costs of\nmarket-making can improve overall market stability. The model offers insights\ninto computational finance by simulating trading without price transparency,\nhighlighting how micro-structural elements can affect macro-level market\noutcomes. This research contributes to the evolving field of computational\nfinance by employing computational intelligence techniques to better understand\nthe fundamental mechanics of government bond markets, providing actionable\ninsights for both academics and practitioners.", "published": "2024-12-15 11:22:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16331v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
