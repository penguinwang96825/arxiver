Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate\nthe functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically\nanalyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art\ndetection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable\ndetection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes\n(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head\nself-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\nlayers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics\ngIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and\nregression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and\nfuture research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings\nreveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive\nto ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable\nattention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to\nits look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across\nblocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in\nDDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model\nsimplification without sacrificing performance.

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we\ndevise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select\nreliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of\nunlabeled data.

The literature is rather rich in NP-completeness\nresults and polynomial time solvable cases. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, only a few exact algorithms have been suggested to address NP-hard\ncases. In this work, we propose exact solution methods based on integer\nprogramming for three perfect graph modification problems: minimum perfect\nediting, minimum perfect completion and the perfect sandwich problem. The\nminimum perfect editing problem inquires the smallest number of edge additions\nand deletions to make a graph perfect, while the completion problem allows only\nedge additions. In the perfect sandwich problem, only a given subset of\nnon-edges can be changed to edges, and the problem asks whether a perfect graph\ncan be obtained in this way. The proposed methods are based on the Strong\nPerfect Graph Theorem. We represent odd holes and odd antiholes as linear\ninequalities, and formulate an integer programming model to solve minimum\nperfect editing problem. To address the exponential number of constraints, we\npropose a cutting plane algorithm which relies on finding odd holes and odd\nantiholes. To enhance the practical efficiency of the cutting plane algorithm,\nwe address the expected number of odd holes and odd antiholes in random graphs.\nIn addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm to make a given graph perfect,\nwhich is used to obtain improved upper bounds for the editing and the\ncompletion problems.

While many state-of-the-art\nANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes\ncreates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn\nnecessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical\nindex implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is\nserialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based\nindexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize\nthe index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is\neither embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads\nthe data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that\nmaps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the\nindex easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The\ndisadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of\nsearching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe\nthis performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a\nfile-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index.

Current artificial systems lack these\nessential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated\ncollective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable\neffective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and\nsystematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how\ndoes the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce\nredundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve\nreasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the\ninterplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the\ncollective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an\nempirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration\nof these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous\nagent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science\nand AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like\ncollaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and\ncritical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle\ncomplex, real-world challenges.", "published": "2025-07-29 16:16:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21969v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}

{"title": "Successor Features for Transfer in Alternating Markov Games", "abstract": "This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum,\ncomplete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent\nsystems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start\" for\nagents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge\ntransfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which\nheavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to\nfailures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper\npresents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel\nalgorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to\naddress Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed\nalgorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An\nupper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity\nof the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we\ndemonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and\none-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial\nconditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path\nefficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.", "published": "2025-07-29 23:06:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22278v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.GT"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations", "abstract": "Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a\nmethod for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data\nsets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time\nseries, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the\nhistorical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data\navailability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative\nadversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not\nexhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a\ncertain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we\ninvestigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs\ncan help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed\nof a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two\napproaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the\nquantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods.\nWe tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond\ndimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series.

{"title": "Deep Learning for Gradient and BCG Artifacts Removal in EEG During Simultaneous fMRI", "abstract": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution\nfor tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by\nartifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and\nballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To\naddress this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning\nframework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using\npaired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from\nthe CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a\ndirect mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional\nartifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent\ncomponent analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet\nthresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared\nerror (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of\n0.8885 $\\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.\nStatistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are\nsignificant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)\ncross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an\naverage RMSE of 0.0635 $\\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\\pm$ 0.0880 across\nunseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that\nDAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to\ninterpret.

This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme\nleveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and\nfar-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility\nmanagement. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the\nconsidered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and\nderive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF\nregion to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE)\ntrajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories\nlike hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing\n(RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed\nalgorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the\nminimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain\nconnectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the\nrequirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO.\nBy restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method\nimproves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in\ncrowded cellular networks.
