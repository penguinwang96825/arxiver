{"title": "A Syntax-aware Multi-task Learning Framework for Chinese Semantic Role\n  Labeling", "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) aims to identify the predicate-argument\nstructure of a sentence. Inspired by the strong correlation between syntax and\nsemantics, previous works pay much attention to improve SRL performance on\nexploiting syntactic knowledge, achieving significant results. Pipeline methods\nbased on automatic syntactic trees and multi-task learning (MTL) approaches\nusing standard syntactic trees are two common research orientations. In this\npaper, we adopt a simple unified span-based model for both span-based and\nword-based Chinese SRL as a strong baseline. Besides, we present a MTL\nframework that includes the basic SRL module and a dependency parser module.\nDifferent from the commonly used hard parameter sharing strategy in MTL, the\nmain idea is to extract implicit syntactic representations from the dependency\nparser as external inputs for the basic SRL model. Experiments on the\nbenchmarks of Chinese Proposition Bank 1.0 and CoNLL-2009 Chinese datasets show\nthat our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance over the\nstrong baselines. With the external BERT representations, our framework\nachieves new state-of-the-art 87.54 and 88.5 F1 scores on the two test data of\nthe two benchmarks, respectively.

As the speech signal carries a lot of information\nabout the speaker, this raises serious privacy concerns.

In this paper, we focus on the protection of\nspeaker identity and study the extent to which users can be recognized based on\nthe encoded representation of their speech as obtained by a deep\nencoder-decoder architecture trained for ASR. Through speaker identification\nand verification experiments on the Librispeech corpus with open and closed\nsets of speakers, we show that the representations obtained from a standard\narchitecture still carry a lot of information about speaker identity. We then\npropose to use adversarial training to learn representations that perform well\nin ASR while hiding speaker identity.
