{"title": "Discriminative Segmental Cascades for Feature-Rich Phone Recognition", "abstract": "Discriminative segmental models, such as segmental conditional random fields\n(SCRFs) and segmental structured support vector machines (SSVMs), have had\nsuccess in speech recognition via both lattice rescoring and first-pass\ndecoding. However, such models suffer from slow decoding, hampering the use of\ncomputationally expensive features, such as segment neural networks or other\nhigh-order features. A typical solution is to use approximate decoding, either\nby beam pruning in a single pass or by beam pruning to generate a lattice\nfollowed by a second pass. In this work, we study discriminative segmental\nmodels trained with a hinge loss (i.e., segmental structured SVMs). We show\nthat beam search is not suitable for learning rescoring models in this\napproach, though it gives good approximate decoding performance when the model\nis already well-trained. Instead, we consider an approach inspired by\nstructured prediction cascades, which use max-marginal pruning to generate\nlattices. We obtain a high-accuracy phonetic recognition system with several\nexpensive feature types: a segment neural network, a second-order language\nmodel, and second-order phone boundary features.", "published": "2015-07-22 06:54:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06073v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Practical Selection of SVM Supervised Parameters with Different Feature\n  Representations for Vowel Recognition", "abstract": "It is known that the classification performance of Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) can be conveniently affected by the different parameters of the kernel\ntricks and the regularization parameter, C. Thus, in this article, we propose a\nstudy in order to find the suitable kernel with which SVM may achieve good\ngeneralization performance as well as the parameters to use. We need to analyze\nthe behavior of the SVM classifier when these parameters take very small or\nvery large values. The study is conducted for a multi-class vowel recognition\nusing the TIMIT corpus. Furthermore, for the experiments, we used different\nfeature representations such as MFCC and PLP. Finally, a comparative study was\ndone to point out the impact of the choice of the parameters, kernel trick and\nfeature representations on the performance of the SVM classifier", "published": "2015-07-22 00:27:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06020v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Robust speech recognition using consensus function based on multi-layer\n  networks", "abstract": "The clustering ensembles mingle numerous partitions of a specified data into\na single clustering solution. Clustering ensemble has emerged as a potent\napproach for ameliorating both the forcefulness and the stability of\nunsupervised classification results. One of the major problems in clustering\nensembles is to find the best consensus function. Finding final partition from\ndifferent clustering results requires skillfulness and robustness of the\nclassification algorithm. In addition, the major problem with the consensus\nfunction is its sensitivity to the used data sets quality. This limitation is\ndue to the existence of noisy, silence or redundant data. This paper proposes a\nnovel consensus function of cluster ensembles based on Multilayer networks\ntechnique and a maintenance database method. This maintenance database approach\nis used in order to handle any given noisy speech and, thus, to guarantee the\nquality of databases. This can generates good results and efficient data\npartitions. To show its effectiveness, we support our strategy with empirical\nevaluation using distorted speech from Aurora speech databases.", "published": "2015-07-22 00:49:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06023v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Incorporating Belief Function in SVM for Phoneme Recognition", "abstract": "The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method has been widely used in numerous\nclassification tasks. The main idea of this algorithm is based on the principle\nof the margin maximization to find an hyperplane which separates the data into\ntwo different classes.In this paper, SVM is applied to phoneme recognition\ntask. However, in many real-world problems, each phoneme in the data set for\nrecognition problems may differ in the degree of significance due to noise,\ninaccuracies, or abnormal characteristics; All those problems can lead to the\ninaccuracies in the prediction phase. Unfortunately, the standard formulation\nof SVM does not take into account all those problems and, in particular, the\nvariation in the speech input. This paper presents a new formulation of SVM\n(B-SVM) that attributes to each phoneme a confidence degree computed based on\nits geometric position in the space. Then, this degree is used in order to\nstrengthen the class membership of the tested phoneme. Hence, we introduce a\nreformulation of the standard SVM that incorporates the degree of belief.\nExperimental performance on TIMIT database shows the effectiveness of the\nproposed method B-SVM on a phoneme recognition problem.", "published": "2015-07-22 01:03:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06025v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
