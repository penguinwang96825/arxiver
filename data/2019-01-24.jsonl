{"title": "Squared English Word: A Method of Generating Glyph to Use Super\n  Characters for Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "The Super Characters method addresses sentiment analysis problems by first\nconverting the input text into images and then applying 2D-CNN models to\nclassify the sentiment. It achieves state of the art performance on many\nbenchmark datasets. However, it is not as straightforward to apply in Latin\nlanguages as in Asian languages. Because the 2D-CNN model is designed to\nrecognize two-dimensional images, it is better if the inputs are in the form of\nglyphs. In this paper, we propose SEW (Squared English Word) method generating\na squared glyph for each English word by drawing Super Characters images of\neach English word at the alphabet level, combining the squared glyph together\ninto a whole Super Characters image at the sentence level, and then applying\nthe CNN model to classify the sentiment within the sentence. We applied the SEW\nmethod to Wikipedia dataset and obtained a 2.1% accuracy gain compared to the\noriginal Super Characters method. For multi-modal data with both structured\ntabular data and unstructured natural language text, the modified SEW method\nintegrates the data into a single image and classifies sentiment with one\nunified CNN model.", "published": "2019-01-24 17:10:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02160v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "FANDA: A Novel Approach to Perform Follow-up Query Analysis", "abstract": "Recent work on Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDB) has attracted\nconsiderable attention. NLIDB allow users to search databases using natural\nlanguage instead of SQL-like query languages. While saving the users from\nhaving to learn query languages, multi-turn interaction with NLIDB usually\ninvolves multiple queries where contextual information is vital to understand\nthe users' query intents. In this paper, we address a typical contextual\nunderstanding problem, termed as follow-up query analysis. In spite of its\nubiquity, follow-up query analysis has not been well studied due to two primary\nobstacles: the multifarious nature of follow-up query scenarios and the lack of\nhigh-quality datasets. Our work summarizes typical follow-up query scenarios\nand provides a new FollowUp dataset with $1000$ query triples on 120 tables.\nMoreover, we propose a novel approach FANDA, which takes into account the\nstructures of queries and employs a ranking model with weakly supervised\nmax-margin learning.

Currently, to formulate a clear and\nfocused clinical problem, the popular PICO framework is usually adopted, in\nwhich each clinical problem is considered to consist of four parts:\npatient/problem (P), intervention (I), comparison (C) and outcome (O). In this\nstudy, we compared several classification models that are commonly used in\ntraditional machine learning.

{"title": "Semantic Classification of Tabular Datasets via Character-Level\n  Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "A character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) motivated by\napplications in \"automated machine learning\" (AutoML) is proposed to\nsemantically classify columns in tabular data. Simulated data containing a set\nof base classes is first used to learn an initial set of weights. Hand-labeled\ndata from the CKAN repository is then used in a transfer-learning paradigm to\nadapt the initial weights to a more sophisticated representation of the problem\n(e.g., including more classes). In doing so, realistic data imperfections are\nlearned and the set of classes handled can be expanded from the base set with\nreduced labeled data and computing power requirements. Results show the\neffectiveness and flexibility of this approach in three diverse domains:\nsemantic classification of tabular data, age prediction from social media\nposts, and email spam classification. In addition to providing further evidence\nof the effectiveness of transfer learning in natural language processing (NLP),\nour experiments suggest that analyzing the semantic structure of language at\nthe character level without additional metadata---i.e., network structure,\nheaders, etc.---can produce competitive accuracy for type classification, spam\nclassification, and social media age prediction.
