Requirements\ntracing usually consists of document parsing, candidate link generation and\nevaluation and traceability analysis. This paper demonstrates the applicability\nof Statistical Term Extraction metrics to generate candidate links. It is\napplied and validated using two data sets and four types of filters two for\neach data set, 0.2 and 0.25 for MODIS, 0 and 0.05 for CM1. This method\ngenerates requirements traceability matrices between textual requirements\nartifacts (such as high-level requirements traced to low-level requirements).\nThe proposed method includes ten word frequency metrics divided into three main\ngroups for calculating the frequency of terms. The results show that the\nproposed method gives better result when compared with the traditional TF-IDF\nmethod.", "published": "2015-06-29 19:21:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08789v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
