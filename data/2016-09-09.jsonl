{"title": "Harassment detection: a benchmark on the #HackHarassment dataset", "abstract": "Online harassment has been a problem to a greater or lesser extent since the\nearly days of the internet. Previous work has applied anti-spam techniques like\nmachine-learning based text classification (Reynolds, 2011) to detecting\nharassing messages. However, existing public datasets are limited in size, with\nlabels of varying quality. The #HackHarassment initiative (an alliance of 1\ntech companies and NGOs devoted to fighting bullying on the internet) has begun\nto address this issue by creating a new dataset superior to its predecssors in\nterms of both size and quality. As we (#HackHarassment) complete further rounds\nof labelling, later iterations of this dataset will increase the available\nsamples by at least an order of magnitude, enabling corresponding improvements\nin the quality of machine learning models for harassment detection. In this\npaper, we introduce the first models built on the #HackHarassment dataset v1.0\n(a new open dataset, which we are delighted to share with any interested\nresearcherss) as a benchmark for future research.", "published": "2016-09-09 14:23:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02809v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Dialogue manager domain adaptation using Gaussian process reinforcement\n  learning", "abstract": "Spoken dialogue systems allow humans to interact with machines using natural\nspeech. As such, they have many benefits. By using speech as the primary\ncommunication medium, a computer interface can facilitate swift, human-like\nacquisition of information. In recent years, speech interfaces have become ever\nmore popular, as is evident from the rise of personal assistants such as Siri,\nGoogle Now, Cortana and Amazon Alexa. Recently, data-driven machine learning\nmethods have been applied to dialogue modelling and the results achieved for\nlimited-domain applications are comparable to or outperform traditional\napproaches. Methods based on Gaussian processes are particularly effective as\nthey enable good models to be estimated from limited training data.\nFurthermore, they provide an explicit estimate of the uncertainty which is\nparticularly useful for reinforcement learning. This article explores the\nadditional steps that are necessary to extend these methods to model multiple\ndialogue domains. We show that Gaussian process reinforcement learning is an\nelegant framework that naturally supports a range of methods, including prior\nknowledge, Bayesian committee machines and multi-agent learning, for\nfacilitating extensible and adaptable dialogue systems.", "published": "2016-09-09 16:02:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02846v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Large Scale Corpus of Gulf Arabic", "abstract": "Most Arabic natural language processing tools and resources are developed to\nserve Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the official written language in\nthe Arab World. Some Dialectal Arabic varieties, notably Egyptian Arabic, have\nreceived some attention lately and have a growing collection of resources that\ninclude annotated corpora and morphological analyzers and taggers. Gulf Arabic,\nhowever, lags behind in that respect. In this paper, we present the Gumar\nCorpus, a large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words\nfrom 1,200 forum novels. We annotate the corpus for sub-dialect information at\nthe document level. We also present results of a preliminary study in the\nmorphological annotation of Gulf Arabic which includes developing guidelines\nfor a conventional orthography.

{"title": "Detecting Singleton Review Spammers Using Semantic Similarity", "abstract": "Online reviews have increasingly become a very important resource for\nconsumers when making purchases. Though it is becoming more and more difficult\nfor people to make well-informed buying decisions without being deceived by\nfake reviews. Prior works on the opinion spam problem mostly considered\nclassifying fake reviews using behavioral user patterns. They focused on\nprolific users who write more than a couple of reviews, discarding one-time\nreviewers. The number of singleton reviewers however is expected to be high for\nmany review websites. While behavioral patterns are effective when dealing with\nelite users, for one-time reviewers, the review text needs to be exploited. In\nthis paper we tackle the problem of detecting fake reviews written by the same\nperson using multiple names, posting each review under a different name. We\npropose two methods to detect similar reviews and show the results generally\noutperform the vectorial similarity measures used in prior works. The first\nmethod extends the semantic similarity between words to the reviews level. The\nsecond method is based on topic modeling and exploits the similarity of the\nreviews topic distributions using two models: bag-of-words and\nbag-of-opinion-phrases. The experiments were conducted on reviews from three\ndifferent datasets: Yelp (57K reviews), Trustpilot (9K reviews) and Ott dataset\n(800 reviews).", "published": "2016-09-09 09:58:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02727v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "I.7.0; J.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Hierarchical Model of Reviews for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years.\nSentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even\nthough they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively,\nsentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the\nreview structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification\nof each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based\nsentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review\nwith a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model\noutperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with\nthe state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five\nmultilingual, multi-domain datasets without any hand-engineered features or\nexternal resources.", "published": "2016-09-09 11:16:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02745v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

We\nachieve good performance on three-point scale sentiment classification, ranking\neighth out of 35, while performing poorly on five-point scale sentiment\nclassification and quantification. An error analysis reveals that this is due\nto low expressiveness of the model to capture negative sentiment as well as an\ninability to take into account ordinal information.
