{"title": "Quantum Powered Credit Risk Assessment: A Novel Approach using hybrid Quantum-Classical Deep Neural Network for Row-Type Dependent Predictive Analysis", "abstract": "The integration of Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) techniques into the landscape\nof financial risk analysis presents a promising avenue for innovation. This\nstudy introduces a framework for credit risk assessment in the banking sector,\ncombining quantum deep learning techniques with adaptive modeling for Row-Type\nDependent Predictive Analysis (RTDPA). By leveraging RTDPA, the proposed\napproach tailors predictive models to different loan categories, aiming to\nenhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk evaluation. While this work\nexplores the potential of integrating quantum methods with classical deep\nlearning for risk assessment, it focuses on the feasibility and performance of\nthis hybrid framework rather than claiming transformative industry-wide\nimpacts. The findings offer insights into how quantum techniques can complement\ntraditional financial analysis, paving the way for further advancements in\npredictive modeling for credit risk.", "published": "2025-02-06 10:57:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07806v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "On the Effect of Alpha Decay and Transaction Costs on the Multi-period Optimal Trading Strategy", "abstract": "We consider the multi-period portfolio optimization problem with a single\nasset that can be held long or short. Due to the presence of transaction costs,\nmaximizing the immediate reward at each period may prove detrimental, as\nfrequent trading results in consistent negative cash outflows. To simulate\nalpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal,\nbut also past values, have predictive power. We formulate the problem as an\ninfinite horizon Markov Decision Process and seek to characterize the optimal\npolicy that realizes the maximum average expected reward. We propose a variant\nof the standard value iteration algorithm for computing the optimal policy.\nEstablishing convergence in our setting is nontrivial, and we provide a\nrigorous proof. Addtionally, we compute a first-order approximation and\nasymptotics of the optimal policy with small transaction costs.", "published": "2025-02-06 18:31:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04284v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.MF", "49J22, 93E20"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "Impermanent loss and Loss-vs-Rebalancing II", "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between impermanent loss (IL) and\nloss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) in automated market makers (AMMs). Our main focus\nis on statistical properties, the impact of fees, the role of block times, and,\nrelated to the latter, the continuous time limit. We find there are three\nrelevant regimes: (i) very short times where LVR and IL are identical; (ii)\nintermediate time where LVR and IL show distinct distribution functions but are\nconnected via the central limit theorem exhibiting the same expectation value;\n(iii) long time behavior where both the distribution functions and averages are\ndistinct. Subsequently, we study how fees change this dynamics with a special\nfocus on competing time scales like block times and 'arbitrage times'.", "published": "2025-02-06 14:16:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04097v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "High-Frequency Market Manipulation Detection with a Markov-modulated Hawkes process", "abstract": "This work focuses on a self-exciting point process defined by a Hawkes-like\nintensity and a switching mechanism based on a hidden Markov chain. Previous\nworks in such a setting assume constant intensities between consecutive events.\nWe extend the model to general Hawkes excitation kernels that are piecewise\nconstant between events. We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm for\nthe statistical inference of the Hawkes intensities parameters as well as the\nstate transition probabilities. The numerical convergence of the estimators is\nextensively tested on simulated data. Using high-frequency cryptocurrency data\non a top centralized exchange, we apply the model to the detection of anomalous\nbursts of trades. We benchmark the goodness-of-fit of the model with the\nMarkov-modulated Poisson process and demonstrate the relevance of the model in\ndetecting suspicious activities.", "published": "2025-02-06 12:31:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04027v1", "categories": ["stat.ME", "q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "stat.ME"}
