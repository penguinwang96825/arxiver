{"title": "ChatGPT and Corporate Policies", "abstract": "We create a firm-level ChatGPT investment score, based on conference calls,\nthat measures managers' anticipated changes in capital expenditures. We\nvalidate the score with interpretable textual content and its strong\ncorrelation with CFO survey responses. The investment score predicts future\ncapital expenditure for up to nine quarters, controlling for Tobin's $q$ and\nother determinants, implying the investment score provides incremental\ninformation about firms' future investment opportunities. The investment score\nalso separately forecasts future total, intangible, and R\\&D investments.\nConsistent with theoretical predictions, high-investment-score firms experience\nsignificant positive short-term returns upon disclosure, and negative long-run\nfuture abnormal returns. We demonstrate ChatGPT's applicability to measure\nother policies, such as dividends and employment.", "published": "2024-09-26 15:09:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17933v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Mamba Meets Financial Markets: A Graph-Mamba Approach for Stock Price Prediction", "abstract": "Stock markets play an important role in the global economy, where accurate\nstock price predictions can lead to significant financial returns. While\nexisting transformer-based models have outperformed long short-term memory\nnetworks and convolutional neural networks in financial time series prediction,\ntheir high computational complexity and memory requirements limit their\npracticality for real-time trading and long-sequence data processing. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SAMBA, an innovative framework for stock\nreturn prediction that builds on the Mamba architecture and integrates graph\nneural networks. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by\nutilizing a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in\nhistorical price data and employing adaptive graph convolution to model\ndependencies between daily stock features. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in\nprediction accuracy, maintaining low computational complexity.

{"title": "Risk measures based on target risk profiles", "abstract": "We address the problem that classical risk measures may not detect the tail\nrisk adequately. This can occur for instance due to the averaging process when\ncomputing Expected Shortfall. The current literature proposes a solution, the\nso-called adjusted Expected Shortfall. This risk measure is the supremum of\nExpected Shortfalls for all possible levels, adjusted with a function $g$, the\nso-called target risk profile. We generalize this idea by using other risk\nmeasures instead of Expected Shortfall. Therefore, we introduce the concept of\ngeneral adjusted risk measures. For these the realization of the adjusted risk\nmeasure quantifies the minimal amount of capital that has to be raised and\ninjected in a financial position $X$ to ensure that the risk measure is always\nsmaller or equal to the adjustment function $g(p)$ for all levels $p\\in[0,1]$.\nWe discuss a variety of assumptions such that desirable properties for risk\nmeasures are satisfied in this setup. From a theoretical point of view, our\nmain contribution is the analysis of equivalent assumptions such that a general\nadjusted risk measure is positive homogeneous and subadditive. Furthermore, we\nshow that these conditions hold for a bunch of new risk measures, beyond the\nadjusted Expected Shortfall. For these risk measures, we derive their dual\nrepresentations. Finally, we test the performance of these new risk measures in\na case study based on the S$\\&$P $500$.", "published": "2024-09-26 09:35:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17676v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
