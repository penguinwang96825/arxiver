{"title": "Mixture of Expert/Imitator Networks: Scalable Semi-supervised Learning\n  Framework", "abstract": "The current success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in an increasingly broad\nrange of tasks involving artificial intelligence strongly depends on the\nquality and quantity of labeled training data. In general, the scarcity of\nlabeled data, which is often observed in many natural language processing\ntasks, is one of the most important issues to be addressed. Semi-supervised\nlearning (SSL) is a promising approach to overcoming this issue by\nincorporating a large amount of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel scalable method of SSL for text classification tasks. The unique property\nof our method, Mixture of Expert/Imitator Networks, is that imitator networks\nlearn to \"imitate\" the estimated label distribution of the expert network over\nthe unlabeled data, which potentially contributes a set of features for the\nclassification. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nconsistently improves the performance of several types of baseline DNNs. We\nalso demonstrate that our method has the more data, better performance property\nwith promising scalability to the amount of unlabeled data.", "published": "2018-10-13 02:39:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05788v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An Empirical Study on Crosslingual Transfer in Probabilistic Topic\n  Models", "abstract": "Probabilistic topic modeling is a popular choice as the first step of\ncrosslingual tasks to enable knowledge transfer and extract multilingual\nfeatures. While many multilingual topic models have been developed, their\nassumptions on the training corpus are quite varied, and it is not clear how\nwell the models can be applied under various training conditions. In this\npaper, we systematically study the knowledge transfer mechanisms behind\ndifferent multilingual topic models, and through a broad set of experiments\nwith four models on ten languages, we provide empirical insights that can\ninform the selection and future development of multilingual topic models.", "published": "2018-10-13 14:35:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05867v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Responsible team players wanted: an analysis of soft skill requirements\n  in job advertisements", "abstract": "During the past decades the importance of soft skills for labour market\noutcomes has grown substantially. This carries implications for labour market\ninequality, since previous research shows that soft skills are not valued\nequally across race and gender. This work explores the role of soft skills in\njob advertisements by drawing on methods from computational science as well as\non theoretical and empirical insights from economics, sociology and psychology.\nWe present a semi-automatic approach based on crowdsourcing and text mining for\nextracting a list of soft skills. We find that soft skills are a crucial\ncomponent of job ads, especially of low-paid jobs and jobs in female-dominated\nprofessions. Our work shows that soft skills can serve as partial predictors of\nthe gender composition in job categories and that not all soft skills receive\nequal wage returns at the labour market. Especially \"female\" skills are\nfrequently associated with wage penalties. Our results expand the growing\nliterature on the association of soft skills on wage inequality and highlight\ntheir importance for occupational gender segregation at labour markets.", "published": "2018-10-13 10:28:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07781v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
