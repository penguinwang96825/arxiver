{"title": "Online High-Frequency Trading Stock Forecasting with Automated Feature Clustering and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks", "abstract": "This study presents an autonomous experimental machine learning protocol for\nhigh-frequency trading (HFT) stock price forecasting that involves a dual\ncompetitive feature importance mechanism and clustering via shallow neural\nnetwork topology for fast training. By incorporating the k-means algorithm into\nthe radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), the proposed method addresses\nthe challenges of manual clustering and the reliance on potentially\nuninformative features. More specifically, our approach involves a dual\ncompetitive mechanism for feature importance, combining the mean-decrease\nimpurity (MDI) method and a gradient descent (GD) based feature importance\nmechanism. This approach, tested on HFT Level 1 order book data for 20 S&P 500\nstocks, enhances the forecasting ability of the RBFNN regressor. Our findings\nsuggest that an autonomous approach to feature selection and clustering is\ncrucial, as each stock requires a different input feature space. Overall, by\nautomating the feature selection and clustering processes, we remove the need\nfor manual topological grid search and provide a more efficient way to predict\nLOB's mid-price.", "published": "2024-11-23 18:30:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16160v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
