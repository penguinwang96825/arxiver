{"title": "Overview of Stemming Algorithms for Indian and Non-Indian Languages", "abstract": "Stemming is a pre-processing step in Text Mining applications as well as a\nvery common requirement of Natural Language processing functions. Stemming is\nthe process for reducing inflected words to their stem. The main purpose of\nstemming is to reduce different grammatical forms / word forms of a word like\nits noun, adjective, verb, adverb etc. to its root form. Stemming is widely\nuses in Information Retrieval system and reduces the size of index files. We\ncan say that the goal of stemming is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes\nderivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. In this paper we\nhave discussed different stemming algorithm for non-Indian and Indian language,\nmethods of stemming, accuracy and errors.", "published": "2014-04-10 17:16:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2878v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
