{"title": "Generalized Mean Absolute Directional Loss as a Solution to Overfitting and High Transaction Costs in Machine Learning Models Used in High-Frequency Algorithmic Investment Strategies", "abstract": "Regardless of the selected asset class and the level of model complexity\n(Transformer versus LSTM versus Perceptron/RNN), the GMADL loss function\nproduces superior results than standard MSE-type loss functions and has better\nnumerical properties in the context of optimization than MADL. Better results\nmean the possibility of achieving a higher risk-weighted return based on buy\nand sell signals built on forecasts generated by a given theoretical model\nestimated using the GMADL versus MSE or MADL function. In practice, GMADL\nsolves the problem of selecting the most preferable feature in both\nclassification and regression problems, improving the performance of each\nestimation. What is important is that, through additional parameterization,\nGMADL also solves the problem of optimizing investment systems on\nhigh-frequency data in such a way that they focus on strategy variants that\ncontain fewer transactions so that transaction costs do not reduce the\neffectiveness of a given strategy to zero. Moreover, the implementation\nleverages state-of-the-art machine learning tools, including frameworks for\nhyperparameter tuning, architecture testing, and walk-forward optimization,\nensuring robust and scalable solutions for real-world algorithmic trading.", "published": "2024-12-24 12:51:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18405v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "INVESTORBENCH: A Benchmark for Financial Decision-Making Tasks with LLM-based Agent", "abstract": "Recent advancements have underscored the potential of large language model\n(LLM)-based agents in financial decision-making. Despite this progress, the\nfield currently encounters two main challenges: (1) the lack of a comprehensive\nLLM agent framework adaptable to a variety of financial tasks, and (2) the\nabsence of standardized benchmarks and consistent datasets for assessing agent\nperformance. To tackle these issues, we introduce \\textsc{InvestorBench}, the\nfirst benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM-based agents in\ndiverse financial decision-making contexts. InvestorBench enhances the\nversatility of LLM-enabled agents by providing a comprehensive suite of tasks\napplicable to different financial products, including single equities like\nstocks, cryptocurrencies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, we\nassess the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of our agent framework\nusing thirteen different LLMs as backbone models, across various market\nenvironments and tasks. Furthermore, we have curated a diverse collection of\nopen-source, multi-modal datasets and developed a comprehensive suite of\nenvironments for financial decision-making. This establishes a highly\naccessible platform for evaluating financial agents' performance across various\nscenarios.", "published": "2024-12-24 05:22:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18174v1", "categories": ["cs.CE", "cs.AI", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CE"}
{"title": "Developing Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Based on Autoencoder-CNN-GANs Algorithms", "abstract": "This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze\nfinancial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to\nfilter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then,\none-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and\nextracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is\nfed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected\nnetwork. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that\nprecede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and\ndirection of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing\ntrades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data,\ncombined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance,\nvalidating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover\nunderlying patterns in financial sequences.

{"title": "A mathematical framework for modelling CLMM dynamics in continuous time", "abstract": "This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing\nConcentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nwithin a continuous-time setting. We model the evolution of liquidity profiles\nas measure-valued processes and characterize their dynamics under continuous\ntrading. Our analysis encompasses two critical aspects of CLMMs: the mechanics\nof concentrated liquidity provision and the strategic behavior of arbitrageurs.\nWe examine three distinct arbitrage models -- myopic, finite-horizon, and\ninfinite-horizon with discounted and ergodic controls -- and derive closed-form\nsolutions for optimal arbitrage strategies under each scenario. Importantly, we\ndemonstrate that the presence of trading fees fundamentally constrains the\nadmissible price processes, as the inclusion of fees precludes the existence of\ndiffusion terms in the price process to avoid infinite fee generation. This\nfinding has significant implications for CLMM design and market efficiency.", "published": "2024-12-24 18:15:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18580v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.TR", "62P05, 93E20"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
