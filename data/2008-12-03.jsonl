{"title": "Strong Spatial Mixing and Approximating Partition Functions of Two-State Spin Systems without Hard Constrains", "abstract": "We prove Gibbs distribution of two-state spin systems(also known as binary Markov random fields) without hard constrains on a tree exhibits strong spatial mixing(also known as strong correlation decay), under the assumption that, for arbitrary `external field', the absolute value of `inverse temperature' is small, or the `external field' is uniformly large or small. The first condition on `inverse temperature' is tight if the distribution is restricted to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic Ising models.\n  Thanks to Weitz's self-avoiding tree, we extends the result for sparse on average graphs, which generalizes part of the recent work of Mossel and Sly\\cite{MS08}, who proved the strong spatial mixing property for ferromagnetic Ising model. Our proof yields a different approach, carefully exploiting the monotonicity of local recursion. To our best knowledge, the second condition of `external field' for strong spatial mixing in this paper is first considered and stated in term of `maximum average degree' and `interaction energy'. As an application, we present an FPTAS for partition functions of two-state spin models without hard constrains under the above assumptions in a general family of graphs including interesting bounded degree graphs.", "published": "2008-12-03 16:56:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0754v2", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.GR"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
