{"title": "Compositional Semantic Parsing on Semi-Structured Tables", "abstract": "Two important aspects of semantic parsing for question answering are the\nbreadth of the knowledge source and the depth of logical compositionality.\nWhile existing work trades off one aspect for another, this paper\nsimultaneously makes progress on both fronts through a new task: answering\ncomplex questions on semi-structured tables using question-answer pairs as\nsupervision. The central challenge arises from two compounding factors: the\nbroader domain results in an open-ended set of relations, and the deeper\ncompositionality results in a combinatorial explosion in the space of logical\nforms. We propose a logical-form driven parsing algorithm guided by strong\ntyping constraints and show that it obtains significant improvements over\nnatural baselines. For evaluation, we created a new dataset of 22,033 complex\nquestions on Wikipedia tables, which is made publicly available.", "published": "2015-08-03 02:53:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Significance of Maximum Spectral Amplitude in Sub-bands for Spectral\n  Envelope Estimation and Its Application to Statistical Parametric Speech\n  Synthesis", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a technique for spectral envelope estimation using\nmaximum values in the sub-bands of Fourier magnitude spectrum (MSASB). Most\nother methods in the literature parametrize spectral envelope in cepstral\ndomain such as Mel-generalized cepstrum etc. Such cepstral domain\nrepresentations, although compact, are not readily interpretable. This\ndifficulty is overcome by our method which parametrizes in the spectral domain\nitself. In our experiments, spectral envelope estimated using MSASB method was\nincorporated in the STRAIGHT vocoder. Both objective and subjective results of\nanalysis-by-synthesis indicate that the proposed method is comparable to\nSTRAIGHT. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed parametrization in\na statistical parametric speech synthesis framework using deep neural networks.", "published": "2015-08-03 09:28:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00354v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
