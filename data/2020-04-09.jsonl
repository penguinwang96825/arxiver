{"title": "SABR smiles for RFR caplets", "abstract": "We present a natural extension of the SABR model to price both backward and forward-looking RFR caplets in a post-Libor world. Forward-looking RFR caplets can be priced using the market standard approximations of Hagan et al. (2002). We provide closed-form effective SABR parameters for pricing backward-looking RFR caplets. These results are useful for smile interpolation and for analyzing backward and forward-looking smiles in normalized units.", "published": "2020-04-09 12:01:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04501v4", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
