{"title": "MarketSenseAI 2.0: Enhancing Stock Analysis through LLM Agents", "abstract": "MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical\nprices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support\ndecision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the\nlatest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion\nin LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nand LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while\nenriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse\ninstitutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental\nanalysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\\&P 100\nstocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative\nreturns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining\ncomparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\\&P 500 stocks during 2024\ndemonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino\nratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying\nLLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of\nLLM-driven investment strategies.", "published": "2025-02-01 12:33:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00415v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.MA", "q-fin.PM", "68T07, 68T50, 91G10, 91G15", "I.2.1; I.2.7; J.4"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
