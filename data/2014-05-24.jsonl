{"title": "Cross-Language Personal Name Mapping", "abstract": "Name matching between multiple natural languages is an important step in\ncross-enterprise integration applications and data mining. It is difficult to\ndecide whether or not two syntactic values (names) from two heterogeneous data\nsources are alternative designation of the same semantic entity (person), this\nprocess becomes more difficult with Arabic language due to several factors\nincluding spelling and pronunciation variation, dialects and special vowel and\nconsonant distinction and other linguistic characteristics. This paper proposes\na new framework for name matching between the Arabic language and other\nlanguages. The framework uses a dictionary based on a new proposed version of\nthe Soundex algorithm to encapsulate the recognition of special features of\nArabic names. The framework proposes a new proximity matching algorithm to suit\nthe high importance of order sensitivity in Arabic name matching. New\nperformance evaluation metrics are proposed as well. The framework is\nimplemented and verified empirically in several case studies demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements compared to other well-known techniques found in\nliterature.", "published": "2014-05-24 11:39:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6293v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
