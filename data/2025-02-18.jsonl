Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions\nis obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this\nequation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected\nwith these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be\nadapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On\nthese digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the\ndigits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of\nthe polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each\nfunction $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear\nequivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when\n$k \\le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures\nstating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of\ntheir linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly\nwith such an integer part only when $k\\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive\nexactly when $k \\le 4$.
