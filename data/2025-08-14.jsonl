{"title": "Spirals and Beyond: Competitive Plane Search with Multi-Speed Agents", "abstract": "We consider the problem of minimizing the worst-case search time for a hidden\npoint target in the plane using multiple mobile agents of differing speeds, all\nstarting from a common origin. The search time is normalized by the target's\ndistance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive\nanalysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all\ntarget locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result\nfor a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about\n$\\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents.\nWe give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a\nlogarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost\nindependent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper\nbound $\\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our\nmain contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time\nfor $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset\nof agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular\noffsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the\ntarget. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can\nbeat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean\nof their speeds exceeds $\\mathcal{U}_n / \\mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents\nmay be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral\nalgorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic\ncomplements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design\nhybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based\nalgorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type\ntrajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.", "published": "2025-08-14 16:16:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10793v1", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}

Only small\ndimensions of linear systems of equations are to be solved for every center in\nthe domain and hence this procedure is more reliable and efficient to solve\nlarge scale physical and engineering problems in complex domain. Laplace\ntransform is utilized for obtaining the equivalent time-independent equation in\nLaplace space and also valuable to handle time-fractional derivatives in the\nCaputo sense. Application of Laplace transform avoids the time steeping\nprocedure which commonly encounters the time instability issues. The solution\nto the transformed model is then obtained by computing the inversion of Laplace\ntransform with an appropriate contour in a complex space, which is approximated\nby trapezoidal rule with high accuracy.

Therewith, the local interpolations satisfies the\nboundary conditions while respecting the geometry of $G$. A $k$th-order\napproximation of the solutions gives rise to a $k$th-order product of\nexponential (POE) spline.

While QINRs recently\nemerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their\narchitecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,\ntraining efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper\nadvances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D\ngeometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual\nField (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural\namplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful\nHilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of\nlearnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations\nperformed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training\nwith fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in\ncontrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs\nprojective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.\nExperiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms\nthe existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines\nin terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model\ncharacteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details.

Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets.

{"title": "Functional Analysis of Variance for Association Studies", "abstract": "While progress has been made in identifying common genetic variants\nassociated with human diseases, for most of common complex diseases, the\nidentified genetic variants only account for a small proportion of\nheritability. Challenges remain in finding additional unknown genetic variants\npredisposing to complex diseases. With the advance in next-generation\nsequencing technologies, sequencing studies have become commonplace in genetic\nresearch. The ongoing exome-sequencing and whole-genome-sequencing studies\ngenerate a massive amount of sequencing variants and allow researchers to\ncomprehensively investigate their role in human diseases. The discovery of new\ndisease-associated variants can be enhanced by utilizing powerful and\ncomputationally efficient statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a\nfunctional analysis of variance (FANOVA) method for testing an association of\nsequence variants in a genomic region with a qualitative trait. The FANOVA has\na number of advantages: (1) it tests for a joint effect of gene variants,\nincluding both common and rare; (2) it fully utilizes linkage disequilibrium\nand genetic position information; and (3) allows for either protective or\nrisk-increasing causal variants. Through simulations, we show that FANOVA\noutperform two popularly used methods - SKAT and a previously proposed method\nbased on functional linear models (FLM), - especially if a sample size of a\nstudy is small and/or sequence variants have low to moderate effects. We\nconduct an empirical study by applying three methods (FANOVA, SKAT and FLM) to\nsequencing data from Dallas Heart Study. While SKAT and FLM respectively\ndetected ANGPTL 4 and ANGPTL 3 associated with obesity, FANOVA was able to\nidentify both genes associated with obesity.", "published": "2025-08-14 21:02:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11069v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.LG", "stat.ME"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}

However, these results primarily address\nthe continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the\nquantized setting.\n  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number\nPartitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset\nSum Problem in a quantized setting.\n  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision\nnetworks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of\na certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized\nsetting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be\nrepresented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary\noverparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of\nthe target network.", "published": "2025-08-14 18:51:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11020v1", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
