{"title": "Morphological Analysis of the Bishnupriya Manipuri Language using Finite\n  State Transducers", "abstract": "In this work we present a morphological analysis of Bishnupriya Manipuri\nlanguage, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the north eastern India. As of now,\nthere is no computational work available for the language. Finite state\nmorphology is one of the successful approaches applied in a wide variety of\nlanguages over the year. Therefore we adapted the finite state approach to\nanalyse morphology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.", "published": "2014-04-22 00:17:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5357v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Lexicon Infused Phrase Embeddings for Named Entity Resolution", "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art approaches for named-entity recognition (NER) use semi\nsupervised information in the form of word clusters and lexicons. Recently\nneural network-based language models have been explored, as they as a byproduct\ngenerate highly informative vector representations for words, known as word\nembeddings. In this paper we present two contributions: a new form of learning\nword embeddings that can leverage information from relevant lexicons to improve\nthe representations, and the first system to use neural word embeddings to\nachieve state-of-the-art results on named-entity recognition in both CoNLL and\nOntonotes NER. Our system achieves an F1 score of 90.90 on the test set for\nCoNLL 2003---significantly better than any previous system trained on public\ndata, and matching a system employing massive private industrial query-log\ndata.", "published": "2014-04-22 02:12:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5367v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Linking Geographic Vocabularies through WordNet", "abstract": "The linked open data (LOD) paradigm has emerged as a promising approach to\nstructuring and sharing geospatial information. One of the major obstacles to\nthis vision lies in the difficulties found in the automatic integration between\nheterogeneous vocabularies and ontologies that provides the semantic backbone\nof the growing constellation of open geo-knowledge bases. In this article, we\nshow how to utilize WordNet as a semantic hub to increase the integration of\nLOD. With this purpose in mind, we devise Voc2WordNet, an unsupervised mapping\ntechnique between a given vocabulary and WordNet, combining intensional and\nextensional aspects of the geographic terms. Voc2WordNet is evaluated against a\nsample of human-generated alignments with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Semantic\nNetwork, a crowdsourced geospatial resource, and the GeoNames ontology, the\nvocabulary of a large digital gazetteer. These empirical results indicate that\nthe approach can obtain high precision and recall.", "published": "2014-04-22 03:28:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5372v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
