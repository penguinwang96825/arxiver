{"title": "A User Simulator for Task-Completion Dialogues", "abstract": "Despite widespread interests in reinforcement-learning for task-oriented\ndialogue systems, several obstacles can frustrate research and development\nprogress. First, reinforcement learners typically require interaction with the\nenvironment, so conventional dialogue corpora cannot be used directly. Second,\neach task presents specific challenges, requiring separate corpus of\ntask-specific annotated data. Third, collecting and annotating human-machine or\nhuman-human conversations for task-oriented dialogues requires extensive domain\nknowledge. Because building an appropriate dataset can be both financially\ncostly and time-consuming, one popular approach is to build a user simulator\nbased upon a corpus of example dialogues. Then, one can train reinforcement\nlearning agents in an online fashion as they interact with the simulator.\nDialogue agents trained on these simulators can serve as an effective starting\npoint. Once agents master the simulator, they may be deployed in a real\nenvironment to interact with humans, and continue to be trained online. To ease\nempirical algorithmic comparisons in dialogues, this paper introduces a new,\npublicly available simulation framework, where our simulator, designed for the\nmovie-booking domain, leverages both rules and collected data. The simulator\nsupports two tasks: movie ticket booking and movie seeking. Finally, we\ndemonstrate several agents and detail the procedure to add and test your own\nagent in the proposed framework.", "published": "2016-12-17 01:03:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05688v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Web-based Semantic Similarity for Emotion Recognition in Web Objects", "abstract": "In this project we propose a new approach for emotion recognition using\nweb-based similarity (e.g. confidence, PMI and PMING). We aim to extract basic\nemotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets,\ncaptions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity\nbetween each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological\nmodel (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include:\ntext preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine\nautomated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of\nsemantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The\nmain idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under\nthe assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search\nengines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through\ntags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions.\nTraining results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative\ntests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g.\nKendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to\neach single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a\ndeeper level of abstraction, aiming at recognizing specific emotions and not\nonly the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic\ndata.", "published": "2016-12-17 11:36:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05734v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
