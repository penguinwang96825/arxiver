{"title": "A note on the Grinberg condition in the cycle spaces", "abstract": "Finding a Hamilton graph from simple connected graphs is an important problem in discrete mathematics and computer science. Grinberg Theorem is a well-known necessary condition for planar Hamilton graphs. It divides a plane into two parts: inside and outside faces. The sum of inside faces in a Hamilton graph is a Hamilton cycle. In this paper, using a basis of the cycle space to represent a graph and by the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we derive the equality with respect to the inside faces that can be also obtained from Grinberg Theorem. By further investigating the cycle structure of inside faces, we give a new combinatorial interpretation to Grinberg's condition, which explains why Grinberg Theorem is not sufficient for Hamilton graphs. Our results will improve deriving an efficient condition for Hamilton graphs.", "published": "2018-07-26 15:05:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10187v6", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Seeded Graph Matching via Large Neighborhood Statistics", "abstract": "We study a well known noisy model of the graph isomorphism problem. In this model, the goal is to perfectly recover the vertex correspondence between two edge-correlated Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, with an initial seed set of correctly matched vertex pairs revealed as side information. For seeded problems, our result provides a significant improvement over previously known results. We show that it is possible to achieve the information-theoretic limit of graph sparsity in time polynomial in the number of vertices $n$. Moreover, we show the number of seeds needed for exact recovery in polynomial-time can be as low as $n^{3\u03b5}$ in the sparse graph regime (with the average degree smaller than $n^\u03b5$) and $\u03a9(\\log n)$ in the dense graph regime.\n  Our results also shed light on the unseeded problem. In particular, we give sub-exponential time algorithms for sparse models and an $n^{O(\\log n)}$ algorithm for dense models for some parameters, including some that are not covered by recent results of Barak et al.", "published": "2018-07-26 17:44:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10262v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DM", "cs.DS", "cs.IT", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Rademacher Generalization Bounds for Classifier Chains", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new framework to study the generalization property of classifier chains trained over observations associated with multiple and interdependent class labels. The results are based on large deviation inequalities for Lipschitz functions of weakly dependent sequences proposed by Rio in 2000. We believe that the resulting generalization error bound brings many advantages and could be adapted to other frameworks that consider interdependent outputs. First, it explicitly exhibits the dependencies between class labels. Secondly, it provides insights of the effect of the order of the chain on the algorithm generalization performances. Finally, the two dependency coefficients that appear in the bound could also be used to design new strategies to decide the order of the chain.", "published": "2018-07-26 14:27:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10166v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Inter-Numerology Interference Analysis for 5G and Beyond", "abstract": "One of the defining characteristics of 5G is the flexibility it offers for supporting different services and communication scenarios. For this purpose, usage of multiple numerologies has been proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The flexibility provided by multi-numerology system comes at the cost of additional interference, known as inter-numerology interference (INI). This paper comprehensively explains the primary cause of INI, and then identifies and describes the factors affecting the amount of INI experienced by each numerology in the system. These factors include subcarrier spacing, number of used subcarriers, power offset, windowing operations and guard bands.", "published": "2018-07-26 17:31:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10256v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
