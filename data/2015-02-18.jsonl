{"title": "Rule-and Dictionary-based Solution for Variations in Written Arabic\n  Names in Social Networks, Big Data, Accounting Systems and Large Databases", "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem that some Arabic names can be written in\nmultiple ways. When someone searches for only one form of a name, neither exact\nnor approximate matching is appropriate for returning the multiple variants of\nthe name. Exact matching requires the user to enter all forms of the name for\nthe search, and approximate matching yields names not among the variations of\nthe one being sought. In this paper, we attempt to solve the problem with a\ndictionary of all Arabic names mapped to their different (alternative) writing\nforms. We generated alternatives based on rules we derived from reviewing the\nfirst names of 9.9 million citizens and former citizens of Jordan. This\ndictionary can be used for both standardizing the written form when inserting a\nnew name into a database and for searching for the name and all its alternative\nwritten forms. Creating the dictionary automatically based on rules resulted in\nat least 7% erroneous acceptance errors and 7.9% erroneous rejection errors. We\naddressed the errors by manually editing the dictionary. The dictionary can be\nof help to real world-databases, with the qualification that manual editing\ndoes not guarantee 100% correctness.", "published": "2015-02-18 23:16:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05441v1", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.DB"}
