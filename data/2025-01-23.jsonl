{"title": "Multimodal Stock Price Prediction", "abstract": "In an era where financial markets are heavily influenced by many static and\ndynamic factors, it has become increasingly critical to carefully integrate\ndiverse data sources with machine learning for accurate stock price prediction.\nThis paper explores a multimodal machine learning approach for stock price\nprediction by combining data from diverse sources, including traditional\nfinancial metrics, tweets, and news articles. We capture real-time market\ndynamics and investor mood through sentiment analysis on these textual data\nusing both ChatGPT-4o and FinBERT models. We look at how these integrated data\nstreams augment predictions made with a standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM\nmodel) to illustrate the extent of performance gains. Our study's results\nindicate that incorporating the mentioned data sources considerably increases\nthe forecast effectiveness of the reference model by up to 5%. We also provide\ninsights into the individual and combined predictive capacities of these\nmodalities, highlighting the substantial impact of incorporating sentiment\nanalysis from tweets and news articles. This research offers a systematic and\neffective framework for applying multimodal data analytics techniques in\nfinancial time series forecasting that provides a new view for investors to\nleverage data for decision-making.", "published": "2025-01-23 16:38:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05186v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
