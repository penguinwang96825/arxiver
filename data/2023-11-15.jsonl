{"title": "Measure of Dependence for Financial Time-Series", "abstract": "Assessing the predictive power of both data and models holds paramount significance in time-series machine learning applications. Yet, preparing time series data accurately and employing an appropriate measure for predictive power seems to be a non-trivial task. This work involves reviewing and establishing the groundwork for a comprehensive analysis of shaping time-series data and evaluating various measures of dependence. Lastly, we present a method, framework, and a concrete example for selecting and evaluating a suitable measure of dependence.", "published": "2023-11-15 20:08:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12129v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
