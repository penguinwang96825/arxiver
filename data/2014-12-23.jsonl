{"title": "A prototype Malayalam to Sign Language Automatic Translator", "abstract": "Sign language, which is a medium of communication for deaf people, uses\nmanual communication and body language to convey meaning, as opposed to using\nsound. This paper presents a prototype Malayalam text to sign language\ntranslation system. The proposed system takes Malayalam text as input and\ngenerates corresponding Sign Language. Output animation is rendered using a\ncomputer generated model. This system will help to disseminate information to\nthe deaf people in public utility places like railways, banks, hospitals etc.\nThis will also act as an educational tool in learning Sign Language.", "published": "2014-12-23 15:51:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7415v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Grammar as a Foreign Language", "abstract": "Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural language\nprocessing and has been the subject of intensive research and engineering for\ndecades. As a result, the most accurate parsers are domain specific, complex,\nand inefficient. In this paper we show that the domain agnostic\nattention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model achieves state-of-the-art results\non the most widely used syntactic constituency parsing dataset, when trained on\na large synthetic corpus that was annotated using existing parsers. It also\nmatches the performance of standard parsers when trained only on a small\nhuman-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highly data-efficient,\nin contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without the attention mechanism. Our\nparser is also fast, processing over a hundred sentences per second with an\nunoptimized CPU implementation.", "published": "2014-12-23 17:16:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
