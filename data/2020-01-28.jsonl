{"title": "Hyperparameter Optimization for Forecasting Stock Returns", "abstract": "In recent years, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has become an increasingly important issue in the field of machine learning for the development of more accurate forecasting models. In this study, we explore the potential of HPO in modeling stock returns using a deep neural network (DNN). The potential of this approach was evaluated using technical indicators and fundamentals examined based on the effect the regularization of dropouts and batch normalization for all input data. We found that the model using technical indicators and dropout regularization significantly outperforms three other models, showing a positive predictability of 0.53% in-sample and 1.11% out-of-sample, thereby indicating the possibility of beating the historical average. We also demonstrate the stability of the model in terms of the changes in its feature importance over time.", "published": "2020-01-28 11:48:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10278v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "CLCNet: Deep learning-based Noise Reduction for Hearing Aids using Complex Linear Coding", "abstract": "Noise reduction is an important part of modern hearing aids and is included in most commercially available devices. Deep learning-based state-of-the-art algorithms, however, either do not consider real-time and frequency resolution constrains or result in poor quality under very noisy conditions. To improve monaural speech enhancement in noisy environments, we propose CLCNet, a framework based on complex valued linear coding. First, we define complex linear coding (CLC) motivated by linear predictive coding (LPC) that is applied in the complex frequency domain. Second, we propose a framework that incorporates complex spectrogram input and coefficient output. Third, we define a parametric normalization for complex valued spectrograms that complies with low-latency and on-line processing. Our CLCNet was evaluated on a mixture of the EUROM database and a real-world noise dataset recorded with hearing aids and compared to traditional real-valued Wiener-Filter gains.", "published": "2020-01-28 09:08:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10218v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
