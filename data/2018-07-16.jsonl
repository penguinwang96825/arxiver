{"title": "The EcoLexicon English Corpus as an open corpus in Sketch Engine", "abstract": "The EcoLexicon English Corpus (EEC) is a 23.1-million-word corpus of\ncontemporary environmental texts. It was compiled by the LexiCon research group\nfor the development of EcoLexicon (Faber, Leon-Arauz & Reimerink 2016; San\nMartin et al. 2017), a terminological knowledge base on the environment. It is\navailable as an open corpus in the well-known corpus query system Sketch Engine\n(Kilgarriff et al. 2014), which means that any user, even without a\nsubscription, can freely access and query the corpus. In this paper, the EEC is\nintroduced by de- scribing how it was built and compiled and how it can be\nqueried and exploited, based both on the functionalities provided by Sketch\nEngine and on the parameters in which the texts in the EEC are classified.", "published": "2018-07-16 11:32:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05797v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Theme-weighted Ranking of Keywords from Text Documents using Phrase\n  Embeddings", "abstract": "Keyword extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing that\nfacilitates mapping of documents to a concise set of representative single and\nmulti-word phrases. Keywords from text documents are primarily extracted using\nsupervised and unsupervised approaches. In this paper, we present an\nunsupervised technique that uses a combination of theme-weighted personalized\nPageRank algorithm and neural phrase embeddings for extracting and ranking\nkeywords. We also introduce an efficient way of processing text documents and\ntraining phrase embeddings using existing techniques. We share an evaluation\ndataset derived from an existing dataset that is used for choosing the\nunderlying embedding model. The evaluations for ranked keyword extraction are\nperformed on two benchmark datasets comprising of short abstracts (Inspec), and\nlong scientific papers (SemEval 2010), and is shown to produce results better\nthan the state-of-the-art systems.", "published": "2018-07-16 16:39:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05962v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "LATE Ain'T Earley: A Faster Parallel Earley Parser", "abstract": "We present the LATE algorithm, an asynchronous variant of the Earley\nalgorithm for parsing context-free grammars. The Earley algorithm is naturally\ntask-based, but is difficult to parallelize because of dependencies between the\ntasks. We present the LATE algorithm, which uses additional data structures to\nmaintain information about the state of the parse so that work items may be\nprocessed in any order. This property allows the LATE algorithm to be sped up\nusing task parallelism. We show that the LATE algorithm can achieve a 120x\nspeedup over the Earley algorithm on a natural language task.", "published": "2018-07-16 00:50:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05642v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Don't get Lost in Negation: An Effective Negation Handled Dialogue Acts\n  Prediction Algorithm for Twitter Customer Service Conversations", "abstract": "In the last several years, Twitter is being adopted by the companies as an\nalternative platform to interact with the customers to address their concerns.\nWith the abundance of such unconventional conversation resources, push for\ndeveloping effective virtual agents is more than ever. To address this\nchallenge, a better understanding of such customer service conversations is\nrequired. Lately, there have been several works proposing a novel taxonomy for\nfine-grained dialogue acts as well as develop algorithms for automatic\ndetection of these acts. The outcomes of these works are providing stepping\nstones for the ultimate goal of building efficient and effective virtual\nagents. But none of these works consider handling the notion of negation into\nthe proposed algorithms. In this work, we developed an SVM-based dialogue acts\nprediction algorithm for Twitter customer service conversations where negation\nhandling is an integral part of the end-to-end solution. For negation handling,\nwe propose several efficient heuristics as well as adopt recent state-of- art\nthird party machine learning based solutions. Empirically we show model's\nperformance gain while handling negation compared to when we don't. Our\nexperiments show that for the informal text such as tweets, the heuristic-based\napproach is more effective.", "published": "2018-07-16 21:01:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06107v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Combining a Context Aware Neural Network with a Denoising Autoencoder\n  for Measuring String Similarities", "abstract": "Measuring similarities between strings is central for many established and\nfast growing research areas including information retrieval, biology, and\nnatural language processing. The traditional approach for string similarity\nmeasurements is to define a metric over a word space that quantifies and sums\nup the differences between characters in two strings. The state-of-the-art in\nthe area has, surprisingly, not evolved much during the last few decades. The\nmajority of the metrics are based on a simple comparison between character and\ncharacter distributions without consideration for the context of the words.\nThis paper proposes a string metric that encompasses similarities between\nstrings based on (1) the character similarities between the words including.\nNon-Standard and standard spellings of the same words, and (2) the context of\nthe words. Our proposal is a neural network composed of a denoising autoencoder\nand what we call a context encoder specifically designed to find similarities\nbetween the words based on their context. The experimental results show that\nthe resulting metrics succeeds in 85.4\\% of the cases in finding the correct\nversion of a non-standard spelling among the closest words, compared to 63.2\\%\nwith the established Normalised-Levenshtein distance. Besides, we show that\nwords used in similar context are with our approach calculated to be similar\nthan words with different contexts, which is a desirable property missing in\nestablished string metrics.", "published": "2018-07-16 12:29:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06414v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Automatic acoustic detection of birds through deep learning: the first\n  Bird Audio Detection challenge", "abstract": "Assessing the presence and abundance of birds is important for monitoring\nspecific species as well as overall ecosystem health. Many birds are most\nreadily detected by their sounds, and thus passive acoustic monitoring is\nhighly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical\nlimitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example\nsound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to\ngeneralise to novel acoustic conditions. Here we report outcomes from a\ncollaborative data challenge showing that with modern machine learning\nincluding deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve\nvery high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data --- with no manual\nrecalibration, and no pre-training of the detector for the target species or\nthe acoustic conditions in the target environment. Multiple methods were able\nto attain performance of around 88% AUC (area under the ROC curve), much higher\nperformance than previous general-purpose methods. We present new acoustic\nmonitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by\nchallenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such\napproaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects.", "published": "2018-07-16 12:06:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05812v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "Subjective and objective experiments on the influence of speaker's\n  gender on the unvoiced segments", "abstract": "Subjective and objective experiments are conducted to understand the extent\nto which a speaker's gender influences the acoustics of unvoiced (U) sounds. U\nsegments of utterances are replaced by the corresponding segments of a speaker\nof opposite gender to prepare modified utterances. Humans are asked to judge if\nthe modified utterance is spoken by one or two speakers. The experiments show\nthat human subjects are unable to distinguish the modified from the original.\nThus, listeners are able to identify the U segments irrespective of the gender,\nwhich may be based on some speaker-independent invariant acoustic cues. To test\nif this finding is purely a perceptual phenomenon, objective experiments are\nalso conducted. Gender specific HMM based phoneme recognition systems are\ntrained using the TIMIT training set and tested on (a) utterances spoken by the\nsame gender (b) utterances spoken by the opposite gender and (c) the modified\nutterances of the test set. As expected, the performance is the highest for\ncase (a) and the lowest for case (b). The performance degrades only slightly\nfor case (c). This result shows that the speaker's gender does not as strongly\ninfluence the acoustics of U sounds as they do the voiced sounds.", "published": "2018-07-16 12:08:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05813v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
