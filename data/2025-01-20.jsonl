{"title": "Defaultable bond liquidity spread estimation: an option-based approach", "abstract": "This paper extends an option-theoretic approach to estimate liquidity spreads\nfor corporate bonds. Inspired by Longstaff's equity market framework and\nsubsequent work by Koziol and Sauerbier on risk-free zero-coupon bonds, the\nmodel views liquidity as a look-back option. The model accounts for the\ninterplay of risk-free rate volatility and credit risk. A numerical analysis\nhighlights the impact of these factors on the liquidity spread, particularly\nfor bonds with different maturities and credit ratings. The methodology is\napplied to estimate the liquidity spread for unquoted bonds, with a specific\ncase study on the Republic of Italy's debt, leveraging market data to calibrate\nmodel parameters and classify liquid versus illiquid emissions. This approach\nprovides a robust tool for pricing illiquid bonds, emphasizing the importance\nof marketability in debt security valuation.", "published": "2025-01-20 11:56:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11427v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
{"title": "Mean-Field Limits for Nearly Unstable Hawkes Processes", "abstract": "In this paper, we establish general scaling limits for nearly unstable Hawkes\nprocesses in a mean-field regime by extending the method introduced by Jaisson\nand Rosenbaum. Under a mild asymptotic criticality condition on the\nself-exciting kernels $\\{\\phi^n\\}$, specifically $\\|\\phi^n\\|_{L^1} \\to 1$, we\nfirst show that the scaling limits of these Hawkes processes are necessarily\nstochastic Volterra diffusions of affine type. Moreover, we establish a\npropagation of chaos result for Hawkes systems with mean-field interactions,\nhighlighting three distinct regimes for the limiting processes, which depend on\nthe asymptotics of $n(1-\\|\\phi^n\\|_{L^1})^2$. These results provide a\nsignificant generalization of the findings by Delattre, Fournier and Hoffmann.", "published": "2025-01-20 18:27:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11648v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.ST", "60F05, 60G55, 60G22, 60F17, 60G57"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
