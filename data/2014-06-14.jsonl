{"title": "Question Answering with Subgraph Embeddings", "abstract": "This paper presents a system which learns to answer questions on a broad\nrange of topics from a knowledge base using few hand-crafted features. Our\nmodel learns low-dimensional embeddings of words and knowledge base\nconstituents; these representations are used to score natural language\nquestions against candidate answers. Training our system using pairs of\nquestions and structured representations of their answers, and pairs of\nquestion paraphrases, yields competitive results on a competitive benchmark of\nthe literature.", "published": "2014-06-14 03:00:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3676v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Mining of product reviews at aspect level", "abstract": "Todays world is a world of Internet, almost all work can be done with the\nhelp of it, from simple mobile phone recharge to biggest business deals can be\ndone with the help of this technology. People spent their most of the times on\nsurfing on the Web it becomes a new source of entertainment, education,\ncommunication, shopping etc. Users not only use these websites but also give\ntheir feedback and suggestions that will be useful for other users. In this way\na large amount of reviews of users are collected on the Web that needs to be\nexplored, analyse and organized for better decision making. Opinion Mining or\nSentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction\ntask that identifies the users views or opinions explained in the form of\npositive, negative or neutral comments and quotes underlying the text. Aspect\nbased opinion mining is one of the level of Opinion mining that determines the\naspect of the given reviews and classify the review for each feature. In this\npaper an aspect based opinion mining system is proposed to classify the reviews\nas positive, negative and neutral for each feature. Negation is also handled in\nthe proposed system. Experimental results using reviews of products show the\neffectiveness of the system.", "published": "2014-06-14 10:39:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3714v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
