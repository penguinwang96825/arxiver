{"title": "On the Equation $x^{2^l+1}+x+a=0$ over $\\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ (Extended Version)", "abstract": "In this paper, the polynomials $P_a(x)=x^{2^l+1}+x+a$ with $a\\in\\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ are studied. New criteria for the number of zeros of $P_a(x)$ in $\\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ are proved. In particular, a criterion for $P_a(x)$ to have exactly one zero in $\\mathrm{GF}(2^k)$ when $\\gcd(l,k)=1$ is formulated in terms of the values of permutation polynomials introduced by Dobbertin. We also study the affine polynomial $a^{2^l}x^{2^{2l}}+x^{2^l}+ax+1$ which is closely related to $P_a(x)$. In many cases, explicit expressions for calculating zeros of these polynomials are provided.", "published": "2008-10-22 09:12:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4015v3", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
