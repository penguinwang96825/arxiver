{"title": "Speech Enhancement Using Pitch Detection Approach For Noisy Environment", "abstract": "Acoustical mismatch among training and testing phases degrades outstandingly\nspeech recognition results. This problem has limited the development of\nreal-world nonspecific applications, as testing conditions are highly variant\nor even unpredictable during the training process. Therefore the background\nnoise has to be removed from the noisy speech signal to increase the signal\nintelligibility and to reduce the listener fatigue. Enhancement techniques\napplied, as pre-processing stages; to the systems remarkably improve\nrecognition results. In this paper, a novel approach is used to enhance the\nperceived quality of the speech signal when the additive noise cannot be\ndirectly controlled. Instead of controlling the background noise, we propose to\nreinforce the speech signal so that it can be heard more clearly in noisy\nenvironments. The subjective evaluation shows that the proposed method improves\nperceptual quality of speech in various noisy environments. As in some cases\nspeaking may be more convenient than typing, even for rapid typists: many\nmathematical symbols are missing from the keyboard but can be easily spoken and\nrecognized. Therefore, the proposed system can be used in an application\ndesigned for mathematical symbol recognition (especially symbols not available\non the keyboard) in schools.", "published": "2013-05-09 08:39:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2352v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "Opportunities & Challenges In Automatic Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition enables a wide range of current and emerging\napplications such as automatic transcription, multimedia content analysis, and\nnatural human-computer interfaces. This paper provides a glimpse of the\nopportunities and challenges that parallelism provides for automatic speech\nrecognition and related application research from the point of view of speech\nresearchers. The increasing parallelism in computing platforms opens three\nmajor possibilities for speech recognition systems: improving recognition\naccuracy in non-ideal, everyday noisy environments; increasing recognition\nthroughput in batch processing of speech data; and reducing recognition latency\nin realtime usage scenarios.

{"title": "An Overview of Hindi Speech Recognition", "abstract": "In this age of information technology, information access in a convenient\nmanner has gained importance. Since speech is a primary mode of communication\namong human beings, it is natural for people to expect to be able to carry out\nspoken dialogue with computer. Speech recognition system permits ordinary\npeople to speak to the computer to retrieve information. It is desirable to\nhave a human computer dialogue in local language. Hindi being the most widely\nspoken Language in India is the natural primary human language candidate for\nhuman machine interaction. There are five pairs of vowels in Hindi languages;\none member is longer than the other one. This paper describes an overview of\nspeech recognition system that includes how speech is produced and the\nproperties and characteristics of Hindi Phoneme.", "published": "2013-05-09 08:44:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2847v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
