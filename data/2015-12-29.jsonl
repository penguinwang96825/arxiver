{"title": "Analyzing Walter Skeat's Forty-Five Parallel Extracts of William\n  Langland's Piers Plowman", "abstract": "Walter Skeat published his critical edition of William Langland's 14th\ncentury alliterative poem, Piers Plowman, in 1886. In preparation for this he\nlocated forty-five manuscripts, and to compare dialects, he published excerpts\nfrom each of these. This paper does three statistical analyses using these\nexcerpts, each of which mimics a task he did in writing his critical edition.\nFirst, he combined multiple versions of a poetic line to create a best line,\nwhich is compared to the mean string that is computed by a generalization of\nthe arithmetic mean that uses edit distance. Second, he claims that a certain\nsubset of manuscripts varies little. This is quantified by computing a string\nvariance, which is closely related to the above generalization of the mean.\nThird, he claims that the manuscripts fall into three groups, which is a\nclustering problem that is addressed by using edit distance. The overall goal\nis to develop methodology that would be of use to a literary critic.", "published": "2015-12-29 00:39:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08569v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
