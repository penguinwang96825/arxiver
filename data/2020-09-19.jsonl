{"title": "Knowledge Transfer via Pre-training for Recommendation: A Review and Prospect", "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to provide item recommendations for users, and are usually faced with data sparsity problem (e.g., cold start) in real-world scenarios. Recently pre-trained models have shown their effectiveness in knowledge transfer between domains and tasks, which can potentially alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommender systems. In this survey, we first provide a review of recommender systems with pre-training. In addition, we show the benefits of pre-training to recommender systems through experiments. Finally, we discuss several promising directions for future research for recommender systems with pre-training.", "published": "2020-09-19 13:06:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09226v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
