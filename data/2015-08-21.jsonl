{"title": "Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language\n  processing models", "abstract": "Many models in natural language processing define probabilistic distributions\nover linguistic structures. We argue that (1) the quality of a model' s\nposterior distribution can and should be directly evaluated, as to whether\nprobabilities correspond to empirical frequencies, and (2) NLP uncertainty can\nbe projected not only to pipeline components, but also to exploratory data\nanalysis, telling a user when to trust and not trust the NLP analysis. We\npresent a method to analyze calibration, and apply it to compare the\nmiscalibration of several commonly used models. We also contribute a\ncoreference sampling algorithm that can create confidence intervals for a\npolitical event extraction task.", "published": "2015-08-21 00:25:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05154v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference", "abstract": "Understanding entailment and contradiction is fundamental to understanding\nnatural language, and inference about entailment and contradiction is a\nvaluable testing ground for the development of semantic representations.\nHowever, machine learning research in this area has been dramatically limited\nby the lack of large-scale resources. To address this, we introduce the\nStanford Natural Language Inference corpus, a new, freely available collection\nof labeled sentence pairs, written by humans doing a novel grounded task based\non image captioning. At 570K pairs, it is two orders of magnitude larger than\nall other resources of its type. This increase in scale allows lexicalized\nclassifiers to outperform some sophisticated existing entailment models, and it\nallows a neural network-based model to perform competitively on natural\nlanguage inference benchmarks for the first time.", "published": "2015-08-21 16:17:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05326v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Simple Text Mining for Sentiment Analysis of Political Figure Using\n  Naive Bayes Classifier Method", "abstract": "Text mining can be applied to many fields. One of the application is using\ntext mining in digital newspaper to do politic sentiment analysis. In this\npaper sentiment analysis is applied to get information from digital news\narticles about its positive or negative sentiment regarding particular\npolitician. This paper suggests a simple model to analyze digital newspaper\nsentiment polarity using naive Bayes classifier method. The model uses a set of\ninitial data to begin with which will be updated when new information appears.\nThe model showed promising result when tested and can be implemented to some\nother sentiment analysis problems.", "published": "2015-08-21 01:40:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05163v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
