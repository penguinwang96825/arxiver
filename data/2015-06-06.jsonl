{"title": "Hybridized Feature Extraction and Acoustic Modelling Approach for\n  Dysarthric Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Dysarthria is malfunctioning of motor speech caused by faintness in the human\nnervous system. It is characterized by the slurred speech along with physical\nimpairment which restricts their communication and creates the lack of\nconfidence and affects the lifestyle. This paper attempt to increase the\nefficiency of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for unimpaired speech\nsignal. It describes state of art of research into improving ASR for speakers\nwith dysarthria by means of incorporated knowledge of their speech production.\nHybridized approach for feature extraction and acoustic modelling technique\nalong with evolutionary algorithm is proposed for increasing the efficiency of\nthe overall system. Here number of feature vectors are varied and tested the\nsystem performance. It is observed that system performance is boosted by\ngenetic algorithm. System with 16 acoustic features optimized with genetic\nalgorithm has obtained highest recognition rate of 98.28% with training time of\n5:30:17.", "published": "2015-06-06 17:05:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02170v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
