{"title": "mARC: Memory by Association and Reinforcement of Contexts", "abstract": "This paper introduces the memory by Association and Reinforcement of Contexts\n(mARC). mARC is a novel data modeling technology rooted in the second\nquantization formulation of quantum mechanics. It is an all-purpose incremental\nand unsupervised data storage and retrieval system which can be applied to all\ntypes of signal or data, structured or unstructured, textual or not. mARC can\nbe applied to a wide range of information clas-sification and retrieval\nproblems like e-Discovery or contextual navigation. It can also for-mulated in\nthe artificial life framework a.k.a Conway \"Game Of Life\" Theory. In contrast\nto Conway approach, the objects evolve in a massively multidimensional space.\nIn order to start evaluating the potential of mARC we have built a mARC-based\nInternet search en-gine demonstrator with contextual functionality. We compare\nthe behavior of the mARC demonstrator with Google search both in terms of\nperformance and relevance. In the study we find that the mARC search engine\ndemonstrator outperforms Google search by an order of magnitude in response\ntime while providing more relevant results for some classes of queries.", "published": "2013-12-10 15:56:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2844v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "nlin.AO", "nlin.CD"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
