{"title": "A CF-Based Randomness Measure for Sequences", "abstract": "This note examines the question of randomness in a sequence based on the continued fraction (CF) representation of its corresponding representation as a number, or as D sequence. We propose a randomness measure that is directly equal to the number of components of the CF representation. This provides a means of quantifying the randomness of the popular PN sequences as well. A comparison is made of representation as a fraction and as a continued fraction.", "published": "2010-03-30 19:41:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.6069v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
