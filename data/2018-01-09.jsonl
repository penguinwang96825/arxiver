{"title": "Denotation Extraction for Interactive Learning in Dialogue Systems", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel task using real user data obtained in\nhuman-machine conversation. The task concerns with denotation extraction from\nanswer hints collected interactively in a dialogue. The task is motivated by\nthe need for large amounts of training data for question answering dialogue\nsystem development, where the data is often expensive and hard to collect.\nBeing able to collect denotation interactively and directly from users, one\ncould improve, for example, natural understanding components on-line and ease\nthe collection of the training data. This paper also presents introductory\nresults of evaluation of several denotation extraction models including\nattention-based neural network approaches.", "published": "2018-01-09 12:30:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02916v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Lifelong Learning for Sentiment Classification", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel lifelong learning (LL) approach to sentiment\nclassification. LL mimics the human continuous learning process, i.e.,\nretaining the knowledge learned from past tasks and use it to help future\nlearning. In this paper, we first discuss LL in general and then LL for\nsentiment classification in particular. The proposed LL approach adopts a\nBayesian optimization framework based on stochastic gradient descent. Our\nexperimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods\nsignificantly, which demonstrates that lifelong learning is a promising\nresearch direction.", "published": "2018-01-09 06:11:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02808v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Biomedical Question Answering via Weighted Neural Network Passage\n  Retrieval", "abstract": "The amount of publicly available biomedical literature has been growing\nrapidly in recent years, yet question answering systems still struggle to\nexploit the full potential of this source of data. In a preliminary processing\nstep, many question answering systems rely on retrieval models for identifying\nrelevant documents and passages. This paper proposes a weighted cosine distance\nretrieval scheme based on neural network word embeddings.

{"title": "Topical Stance Detection for Twitter: A Two-Phase LSTM Model Using\n  Attention", "abstract": "The topical stance detection problem addresses detecting the stance of the\ntext content with respect to a given topic: whether the sentiment of the given\ntext content is in FAVOR of (positive), is AGAINST (negative), or is NONE\n(neutral) towards the given topic. Using the concept of attention, we develop a\ntwo-phase solution. In the first phase, we classify subjectivity - whether a\ngiven tweet is neutral or subjective with respect to the given topic. In the\nsecond phase, we classify sentiment of the subjective tweets (ignoring the\nneutral tweets) - whether a given subjective tweet has a FAVOR or AGAINST\nstance towards the topic. We propose a Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) based deep\nneural network for each phase, and embed attention at each of the phases. On\nthe SemEval 2016 stance detection Twitter task dataset, we obtain a best-case\nmacro F-score of 68.84% and a best-case accuracy of 60.2%, outperforming the\nexisting deep learning based solutions. Our framework, T-PAN, is the first in\nthe topical stance detection literature, that uses deep learning within a\ntwo-phase architecture.", "published": "2018-01-09 17:00:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03032v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Polar $n$-Complex and $n$-Bicomplex Singular Value Decomposition and\n  Principal Component Pursuit", "abstract": "Informed by recent work on tensor singular value decomposition and circulant\nalgebra matrices, this paper presents a new theoretical bridge that unifies the\nhypercomplex and tensor-based approaches to singular value decomposition and\nrobust principal component analysis. We begin our work by extending the\nprincipal component pursuit to Olariu's polar $n$-complex numbers as well as\ntheir bicomplex counterparts. In so doing, we have derived the polar\n$n$-complex and $n$-bicomplex proximity operators for both the $\\ell_1$- and\ntrace-norm regularizers, which can be used by proximal optimization methods\nsuch as the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experimental results\non two sets of audio data show that our algebraically-informed formulation\noutperforms tensor robust principal component analysis. We conclude with the\nmessage that an informed definition of the trace norm can bridge the gap\nbetween the hypercomplex and tensor-based approaches. Our approach can be seen\nas a general methodology for generating other principal component pursuit\nalgorithms with proper algebraic structures.", "published": "2018-01-09 00:45:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03773v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.MM", "cs.SD", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Informed Group-Sparse Representation for Singing Voice Separation", "abstract": "Singing voice separation attempts to separate the vocal and instrumental\nparts of a music recording, which is a fundamental problem in music information\nretrieval. Recent work on singing voice separation has shown that the low-rank\nrepresentation and informed separation approaches are both able to improve\nseparation quality. However, low-rank optimizations are computationally\ninefficient due to the use of singular value decompositions. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a new linear-time algorithm called informed group-sparse\nrepresentation, and use it to separate the vocals from music using pitch\nannotations as side information. Experimental results on the iKala dataset\nconfirm the efficacy of our approach, suggesting that the music accompaniment\nfollows a group-sparse structure given a pre-trained instrumental dictionary.\nWe also show how our work can be easily extended to accommodate multiple\ndictionaries using the DSD100 dataset.", "published": "2018-01-09 00:45:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03815v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.IR", "cs.SD", "eess.SP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Complex and Quaternionic Principal Component Pursuit and Its Application\n  to Audio Separation", "abstract": "Recently, the principal component pursuit has received increasing attention\nin signal processing research ranging from source separation to video\nsurveillance. So far, all existing formulations are real-valued and lack the\nconcept of phase, which is inherent in inputs such as complex spectrograms or\ncolor images. Thus, in this letter, we extend principal component pursuit to\nthe complex and quaternionic cases to account for the missing phase\ninformation. Specifically, we present both complex and quaternionic proximity\noperators for the $\\ell_1$- and trace-norm regularizers. These operators can be\nused in conjunction with proximal minimization methods such as the inexact\naugmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm. The new algorithms are then applied to\nthe singing voice separation problem, which aims to separate the singing voice\nfrom the instrumental accompaniment. Results on the iKala and MSD100 datasets\nconfirmed the usefulness of phase information in principal component pursuit.", "published": "2018-01-09 00:39:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03816v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.MM", "cs.SD", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
