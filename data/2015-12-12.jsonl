{"title": "A Hidden Markov Model Based System for Entity Extraction from Social\n  Media English Text at FIRE 2015", "abstract": "This paper presents the experiments carried out by us at Jadavpur University\nas part of the participation in FIRE 2015 task: Entity Extraction from Social\nMedia Text - Indian Languages (ESM-IL). The tool that we have developed for the\ntask is based on Trigram Hidden Markov Model that utilizes information like\ngazetteer list, POS tag and some other word level features to enhance the\nobservation probabilities of the known tokens as well as unknown tokens. We\nsubmitted runs for English only. A statistical HMM (Hidden Markov Models) based\nmodel has been used to implement our system. The system has been trained and\ntested on the datasets released for FIRE 2015 task: Entity Extraction from\nSocial Media Text - Indian Languages (ESM-IL). Our system is the best performer\nfor English language and it obtains precision, recall and F-measures of 61.96,\n39.46 and 48.21 respectively.", "published": "2015-12-12 18:57:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03950v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
