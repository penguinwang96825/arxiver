{"title": "Improving Collaborative Filtering based Recommenders using Topic\n  Modelling", "abstract": "Standard Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms make use of interactions\nbetween users and items in the form of implicit or explicit ratings alone for\ngenerating recommendations. Similarity among users or items is calculated\npurely based on rating overlap in this case,without considering explicit\nproperties of users or items involved, limiting their applicability in domains\nwith very sparse rating spaces. In many domains such as movies, news or\nelectronic commerce recommenders, considerable contextual data in text form\ndescribing item properties is available along with the rating data, which could\nbe utilized to improve recommendation quality.In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to improve standard CF based recommenders by utilizing latent\nDirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn latent properties of items, expressed in\nterms of topic proportions, derived from their textual description. We infer\nuser's topic preferences or persona in the same latent space,based on her\nhistorical ratings. While computing similarity between users, we make use of a\ncombined similarity measure involving rating overlap as well as similarity in\nthe latent topic space. This approach alleviates sparsity problem as it allows\ncalculation of similarity between users even if they have not rated any items\nin common. Our experiments on multiple public datasets indicate that the\nproposed hybrid approach significantly outperforms standard user Based and item\nBased CF recommenders in terms of classification accuracy metrics such as\nprecision, recall and f-measure.", "published": "2014-02-25 16:52:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6238v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
