{"title": "Second-Order Agents on Ring Digraphs", "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of consensus seeking among second-order linear agents interconnected in a specific ring topology. Unlike the existing results in the field dealing with one-directional digraphs arising in various cyclic pursuit algorithms or two-directional graphs, we focus on the case where some arcs in a two-directional ring graph are dropped in a regular fashion. The derived condition for achieving consensus turns out to be independent of the number of agents in a network.", "published": "2018-11-22 21:04:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09306v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "eess.SY", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
