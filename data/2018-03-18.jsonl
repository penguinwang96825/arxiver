{"title": "Sentiment Analysis of Code-Mixed Indian Languages: An Overview of\n  SAIL_Code-Mixed Shared Task @ICON-2017", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is essential in many real-world applications such as\nstance detection, review analysis, recommendation system, and so on. Sentiment\nanalysis becomes more difficult when the data is noisy and collected from\nsocial media. India is a multilingual country; people use more than one\nlanguages to communicate within themselves. The switching in between the\nlanguages is called code-switching or code-mixing, depending upon the type of\nmixing. This paper presents overview of the shared task on sentiment analysis\nof code-mixed data pairs of Hindi-English and Bengali-English collected from\nthe different social media platform. The paper describes the task, dataset,\nevaluation, baseline and participant's systems.", "published": "2018-03-18 21:32:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06745v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Web as a Knowledge-base for Answering Complex Questions", "abstract": "Answering complex questions is a time-consuming activity for humans that\nrequires reasoning and integration of information. Recent work on reading\ncomprehension made headway in answering simple questions, but tackling complex\nquestions is still an ongoing research challenge. Conversely, semantic parsers\nhave been successful at handling compositionality, but only when the\ninformation resides in a target knowledge-base. In this paper, we present a\nnovel framework for answering broad and complex questions, assuming answering\nsimple questions is possible using a search engine and a reading comprehension\nmodel. We propose to decompose complex questions into a sequence of simple\nquestions, and compute the final answer from the sequence of answers. To\nillustrate the viability of our approach, we create a new dataset of complex\nquestions, ComplexWebQuestions, and present a model that decomposes questions\nand interacts with the web to compute an answer. We empirically demonstrate\nthat question decomposition improves performance from 20.8 precision@1 to 27.5\nprecision@1 on this new dataset.", "published": "2018-03-18 11:28:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06643v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Directional emphasis in ambisonics", "abstract": "We describe an ambisonics enhancement method that increases the signal\nstrength in specified directions at low computational cost. The method can be\nused in a static setup to emphasize the signal arriving from a particular\ndirection or set of directions. It can also be used in an adaptive arrangement\nwhere it sharpens directionality and reduces the distortion in timbre\nassociated with low-degree ambisonics representations. The emphasis operator\nhas very low computational complexity and can be applied to time-domain as well\nas time-frequency ambisonics representations. The operator upscales a\nlow-degree ambisonics representation to a higher degree representation.", "published": "2018-03-18 19:10:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06718v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
