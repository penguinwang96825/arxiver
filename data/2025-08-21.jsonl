Our approach accounts for the full\nstack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,\nhost system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.\nThrough detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the\nGemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24\nWh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also\nshow that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement\nhave driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon\nfootprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify\nthat the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine\nseconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of\nwater (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily\nactivities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to\nwarrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a\ncomprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for\naccurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains\nacross the full AI serving stack.", "published": "2025-08-21 17:22:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15734v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

To tackle these\nissues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that\nconstructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a\nself-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.\nSpecifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook\n(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby\nconstructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance\nthe reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement\nstage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a\nMulti-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy.

{"title": "Exploiting Policy Idling for Dexterous Manipulation", "abstract": "Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress\nin recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches.

In reality, training data are often\nmissing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In\naddition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to\ndropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such\ncoarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of\nwell-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and\nefficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of\nobtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given\ncoarsened training data.

However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining. On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.

Currently, annotation is primarily performed\nthrough manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,\nwhich often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful\ntools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on\nwell-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly\navailable MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this\ngap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network\nwith Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such\nas tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based\nneural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and\nsignificantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks.\nThe accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches\nstate-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated\nbrain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated\n200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of\nthree neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet.

{"title": "Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is\ncrucial to understand individual agent behaviors. While prior work typically\nevaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals, it is\nunclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback.\nIn this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors\ncan be extracted solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the\nphenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental\nvalues, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on\ninformation-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal\ninfluence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs\nmeasure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their\ndecision (un)certainty and preference alignment. By analyzing action effects on\npolicies and value functions across cooperative and competitive MARL tasks, our\nmethod identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either\nby fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future\naction choices, while also revealing the extent to which agents adopt similar\nor diverse strategies.
