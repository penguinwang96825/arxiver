{"title": "Text segmentation with character-level text embeddings", "abstract": "Learning word representations has recently seen much success in computational\nlinguistics. However, assuming sequences of word tokens as input to linguistic\nanalysis is often unjustified. For many languages word segmentation is a\nnon-trivial task and naturally occurring text is sometimes a mixture of natural\nlanguage strings and other character data. We propose to learn text\nrepresentations directly from raw character sequences by training a Simple\nrecurrent Network to predict the next character in text. The network uses its\nhidden layer to evolve abstract representations of the character sequences it\nsees. To demonstrate the usefulness of the learned text embeddings, we use them\nas features in a supervised character level text segmentation and labeling\ntask: recognizing spans of text containing programming language code. By using\nthe embeddings as features we are able to substantially improve over a baseline\nwhich uses only surface character n-grams.", "published": "2013-09-18 12:38:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4628v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
