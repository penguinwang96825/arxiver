{"title": "Improving Device Directedness Classification of Utterances with Semantic Lexical Features", "abstract": "User interactions with personal assistants like Alexa, Google Home and Siri are typically initiated by a wake term or wakeword. Several personal assistants feature \"follow-up\" modes that allow users to make additional interactions without the need of a wakeword. For the system to only respond when appropriate, and to ignore speech not intended for it, utterances must be classified as device-directed or non-device-directed. State-of-the-art systems have largely used acoustic features for this task, while others have used only lexical features or have added LM-based lexical features. We propose a directedness classifier that combines semantic lexical features with a lightweight acoustic feature and show it is effective in classifying directedness. The mixed-domain lexical and acoustic feature model is able to achieve 14% relative reduction of EER over a state-of-the-art acoustic-only baseline model. Finally, we successfully apply transfer learning and semi-supervised learning to the model to improve accuracy even further.", "published": "2020-09-29 20:13:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01949v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Reannealing of Decaying Exploration Based On Heuristic Measure in Deep Q-Network", "abstract": "Existing exploration strategies in reinforcement learning (RL) often either ignore the history or feedback of search, or are complicated to implement. There is also a very limited literature showing their effectiveness over diverse domains. We propose an algorithm based on the idea of reannealing, that aims at encouraging exploration only when it is needed, for example, when the algorithm detects that the agent is stuck in a local optimum. The approach is simple to implement. We perform an illustrative case study showing that it has potential to both accelerate training and obtain a better policy.", "published": "2020-09-29 20:40:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14297v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning based approach for User-Centric Power Optimization in Smart Home Environments", "abstract": "Smart homes require every device inside them to be connected with each other at all times, which leads to a lot of power wastage on a daily basis. As the devices inside a smart home increase, it becomes difficult for the user to control or operate every individual device optimally. Therefore, users generally rely on power management systems for such optimization but often are not satisfied with the results. In this paper, we present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with two-fold objectives of minimizing power consumption and maximizing user satisfaction. The framework explores the trade-off between the two objectives and converges to a better power management policy when both objectives are considered while finding an optimal policy. We experiment on real-world smart home data, and show that the multi-objective approaches: i) establish trade-off between the two objectives, ii) achieve better combined user satisfaction and power consumption than single-objective approaches. We also show that the devices that are used regularly and have several fluctuations in device modes at regular intervals should be targeted for optimization, and the experiments on data from other smart homes fetch similar results, hence ensuring transfer-ability of the proposed framework.", "published": "2020-09-29 08:28:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13854v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Visually-Grounded Planning without Vision: Language Models Infer Detailed Plans from High-level Instructions", "abstract": "The recently proposed ALFRED challenge task aims for a virtual robotic agent to complete complex multi-step everyday tasks in a virtual home environment from high-level natural language directives, such as \"put a hot piece of bread on a plate\". Currently, the best-performing models are able to complete less than 5% of these tasks successfully. In this work we focus on modeling the translation problem of converting natural language directives into detailed multi-step sequences of actions that accomplish those goals in the virtual environment. We empirically demonstrate that it is possible to generate gold multi-step plans from language directives alone without any visual input in 26% of unseen cases. When a small amount of visual information is incorporated, namely the starting location in the virtual environment, our best-performing GPT-2 model successfully generates gold command sequences in 58% of cases. Our results suggest that contextualized language models may provide strong visual semantic planning modules for grounded virtual agents.", "published": "2020-09-29 18:52:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14259v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Trustworthy Convolutional Neural Networks: A Gradient Penalized-based Approach", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification. Saliency methods are examples of approaches that can be used to interpret CNNs post hoc, identifying the most relevant pixels for a prediction following the gradients flow. Even though CNNs can correctly classify images, the underlying saliency maps could be erroneous in many cases. This can result in skepticism as to the validity of the model or its interpretation. We propose a novel approach for training trustworthy CNNs by penalizing parameter choices that result in inaccurate saliency maps generated during training. We add a penalty term for inaccurate saliency maps produced when the predicted label is correct, a penalty term for accurate saliency maps produced when the predicted label is incorrect, and a regularization term penalizing overly confident saliency maps. Experiments show increased classification performance, user engagement, and trust.", "published": "2020-09-29 18:56:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14260v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "Internet Photonic Sensing: Using Internet Fiber Optics for Vibration Measurement and Monitoring", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Internet Photonic Sensing (IPS), a new framework for deformation and vibration measurement and monitoring based on signals that are available from standard fiber optic communication hardware deployed in the Internet. IPS is based on the hypothesis that atmospheric, seismic, anthropogenic and other natural activity cause vibrations in the earth that trigger detectable changes in standard optical signals that transmit data through Internet fiber. We assume a simple system component model for optical communication hardware and identify two candidate signals that may reflect deformation and vibrations and that can be measured through standard interfaces: Optical Signal Strength (OSS) and Bit Error Rate (BER). We investigate the efficacy of IPS through a series of controlled, laboratory experiments that consider how the candidate signals respond when fiber is subjected to a range of stresses. We believe that IPS offers the potential to transform the practice of scientific, commercial and public safety-related vibration monitoring applications by providing a highly-sensitive platform that is available at a global scale.", "published": "2020-09-29 06:10:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13797v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.NI"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
