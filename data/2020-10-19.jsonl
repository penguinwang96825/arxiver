{"title": "Deriving Commonsense Inference Tasks from Interactive Fictions", "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning simulates the human ability to make presumptions about our physical world, and it is an indispensable cornerstone in building general AI systems. We propose a new commonsense reasoning dataset based on human's interactive fiction game playings as human players demonstrate plentiful and diverse commonsense reasoning. The new dataset mitigates several limitations of the prior art. Experiments show that our task is solvable to human experts with sufficient commonsense knowledge but poses challenges to existing machine reading models, with a big performance gap of more than 30%.", "published": "2020-10-19 19:02:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09788v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "The Graphs of Stably Matchable Pairs", "abstract": "We study the graphs formed from instances of the stable matching problem by connecting pairs of elements with an edge when there exists a stable matching in which they are matched. Our results include the NP-completeness of recognizing these graphs, an exact recognition algorithm that is singly exponential in the number of edges of the given graph, and an algorithm whose time is linear in the number of vertices of the graph but exponential in a polynomial of its carving width. We also provide characterizations of graphs of stably matchable pairs that belong to certain classes of graphs, and of the lattices of stable matchings that can have graphs in these classes.", "published": "2020-10-19 05:26:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09230v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Leader Election And Local Identifiers For 3D Programmable Matter", "abstract": "In this paper, we present two deterministic leader election algorithms for programmable matter on the face-centered cubic grid. The face-centered cubic grid is a 3-dimensional 12-regular infinite grid that represents an optimal way to pack spheres (i.e., spherical particles or modules in the context of the programmable matter) in the 3-dimensional space. While the first leader election algorithm requires a strong hypothesis about the initial configuration of the particles and no hypothesis on the system configurations that the particles are forming, the second one requires fewer hypothesis about the initial configuration of the particles but does not work for all possible particles' arrangement. We also describe a way to compute and assign-local identifiers to the particles in this grid with a memory space not dependent on the number of particles. A-local identifier is a variable assigned to each particle in such a way that particles at distance at most each have a different identifier.", "published": "2020-10-19 07:58:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09286v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.DS", "cs.NI"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "A Unified Model for Recommendation with Selective Neighborhood Modeling", "abstract": "Neighborhood-based recommenders are a major class of Collaborative Filtering (CF) models. The intuition is to exploit neighbors with similar preferences for bridging unseen user-item pairs and alleviating data sparseness. Many existing works propose neural attention networks to aggregate neighbors and place higher weights on specific subsets of users for recommendation. However, the neighborhood information is not necessarily always informative, and the noises in the neighborhood can negatively affect the model performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel neighborhood-based recommender, where a hybrid gated network is designed to automatically separate similar neighbors from dissimilar (noisy) ones, and aggregate those similar neighbors to comprise neighborhood representations. The confidence in the neighborhood is also addressed by putting higher weights on the neighborhood representations if we are confident with the neighborhood information, and vice versa. In addition, a user-neighbor component is proposed to explicitly regularize user-neighbor proximity in the latent space. These two components are combined into a unified model to complement each other for the recommendation task. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art neighborhood-based recommenders. We also study different variants of the proposed model to justify the underlying intuition of the proposed hybrid gated network and user-neighbor modeling components.", "published": "2020-10-19 08:06:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08547v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Learnable Spectro-temporal Receptive Fields for Robust Voice Type Discrimination", "abstract": "Voice Type Discrimination (VTD) refers to discrimination between regions in a recording where speech was produced by speakers that are physically within proximity of the recording device (\"Live Speech\") from speech and other types of audio that were played back such as traffic noise and television broadcasts (\"Distractor Audio\"). In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based VTD system that features an initial layer of learnable spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs). Our approach is also shown to provide very strong performance on a similar spoofing detection task in the ASVspoof 2019 challenge. We evaluate our approach on a new standardized VTD database that was collected to support research in this area. In particular, we study the effect of using learnable STRFs compared to static STRFs or unconstrained kernels. We also show that our system consistently improves a competitive baseline system across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios on spoofing detection in the presence of VTD distractor noise.", "published": "2020-10-19 00:29:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09151v1", "categories": ["eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
