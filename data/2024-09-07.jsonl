{"title": "Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on\nSOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By\ndefinition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference\nperiod: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward\nprice as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian\noption with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We\ndevelop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems\nsemi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the\noption Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer\nfrom LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key\nmoney market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any\npricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures\ncurrently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final\nmetamorphosis into exotic options.", "published": "2024-09-07 20:13:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
