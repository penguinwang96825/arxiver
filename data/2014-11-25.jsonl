{"title": "One Vector is Not Enough: Entity-Augmented Distributional Semantics for\n  Discourse Relations", "abstract": "Discourse relations bind smaller linguistic units into coherent texts.\nHowever, automatically identifying discourse relations is difficult, because it\nrequires understanding the semantics of the linked arguments. A more subtle\nchallenge is that it is not enough to represent the meaning of each argument of\na discourse relation, because the relation may depend on links between\nlower-level components, such as entity mentions. Our solution computes\ndistributional meaning representations by composition up the syntactic parse\ntree. A key difference from previous work on compositional distributional\nsemantics is that we also compute representations for entity mentions, using a\nnovel downward compositional pass. Discourse relations are predicted from the\ndistributional representations of the arguments, and also of their coreferent\nentity mentions. The resulting system obtains substantial improvements over the\nprevious state-of-the-art in predicting implicit discourse relations in the\nPenn Discourse Treebank.", "published": "2014-11-25 01:25:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6699v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "LABR: A Large Scale Arabic Sentiment Analysis Benchmark", "abstract": "We introduce LABR, the largest sentiment analysis dataset to-date for the\nArabic language. It consists of over 63,000 book reviews, each rated on a scale\nof 1 to 5 stars. We investigate the properties of the dataset, and present its\nstatistics. We explore using the dataset for two tasks: (1) sentiment polarity\nclassification; and (2) ratings classification. Moreover, we provide standard\nsplits of the dataset into training, validation and testing, for both polarity\nand ratings classification, in both balanced and unbalanced settings. We extend\nour previous work by performing a comprehensive analysis on the dataset. In\nparticular, we perform an extended survey of the different classifiers\ntypically used for the sentiment polarity classification problem. We also\nconstruct a sentiment lexicon from the dataset that contains both single and\ncompound sentiment words and we explore its effectiveness. We make the dataset\nand experimental details publicly available.", "published": "2014-11-25 03:48:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6718v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
