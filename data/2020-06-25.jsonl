{"title": "Distributed Policy Synthesis of Multi-Agent Systems With Graph Temporal Logic Specifications", "abstract": "We study the distributed synthesis of policies for multi-agent systems to perform \\emph{spatial-temporal} tasks. We formalize the synthesis problem as a \\emph{factored} Markov decision process subject to \\emph{graph temporal logic} specifications. The transition function and task of each agent are functions of the agent itself and its neighboring agents. In this work, we develop another distributed synthesis method, which improves the scalability and runtime by two orders of magnitude compared to our prior work. The synthesis method decomposes the problem into a set of smaller problems, one for each agent by leveraging the structure in the model, and the specifications. We show that the running time of the method is linear in the number of agents. The size of the problem for each agent is exponential only in the number of neighboring agents, which is typically much smaller than the number of agents. We demonstrate the applicability of the method in case studies on disease control, urban security, and search and rescue. The numerical examples show that the method scales to hundreds of agents with hundreds of states per agent and can also handle significantly larger state spaces than our prior work.", "published": "2020-06-25 00:56:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14947v3", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "A decomposition of general premium principles into risk and deviation", "abstract": "We provide an axiomatic approach to general premium principles in a probability-free setting that allows for Knightian uncertainty. Every premium principle is the sum of a risk measure, as a generalization of the expected value, and a deviation measure, as a generalization of the variance. One can uniquely identify a maximal risk measure and a minimal deviation measure in such decompositions. We show how previous axiomatizations of premium principles can be embedded into our more general framework. We discuss dual representations of convex premium principles, and study the consistency of premium principles with a financial market in which insurance contracts are traded.", "published": "2020-06-25 09:32:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14272v3", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
