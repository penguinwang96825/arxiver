{"title": "Seeing What You're Told: Sentence-Guided Activity Recognition In Video", "abstract": "We present a system that demonstrates how the compositional structure of\nevents, in concert with the compositional structure of language, can interplay\nwith the underlying focusing mechanisms in video action recognition, thereby\nproviding a medium, not only for top-down and bottom-up integration, but also\nfor multi-modal integration between vision and language. We show how the roles\nplayed by participants (nouns), their characteristics (adjectives), the actions\nperformed (verbs), the manner of such actions (adverbs), and changing spatial\nrelations between participants (prepositions) in the form of whole sentential\ndescriptions mediated by a grammar, guides the activity-recognition process.\nFurther, the utility and expressiveness of our framework is demonstrated by\nperforming three separate tasks in the domain of multi-activity videos:\nsentence-guided focus of attention, generation of sentential descriptions of\nvideo, and query-based video search, simply by leveraging the framework in\ndifferent manners.", "published": "2013-08-19 23:28:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4189v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
