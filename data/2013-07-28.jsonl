{"title": "Learning Frames from Text with an Unsupervised Latent Variable Model", "abstract": "We develop a probabilistic latent-variable model to discover semantic\nframes---types of events and their participants---from corpora. We present a\nDirichlet-multinomial model in which frames are latent categories that explain\nthe linking of verb-subject-object triples, given document-level sparsity. We\nanalyze what the model learns, and compare it to FrameNet, noting it learns\nsome novel and interesting frames. This document also contains a discussion of\ninference issues, including concentration parameter learning; and a small-scale\nerror analysis of syntactic parsing accuracy.", "published": "2013-07-28 16:55:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7382v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
