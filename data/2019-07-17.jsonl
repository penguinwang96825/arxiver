{"title": "A model-free backward and forward nonlinear PDEs for implied volatility", "abstract": "We derive a backward and forward nonlinear PDEs that govern the implied volatility of a contingent claim whenever the latter is well-defined. This would include at least any contingent claim written on a positive stock price whose payoff at a possibly random time is convex. We also discuss suitable initial and boundary conditions for those PDEs. Finally, we demonstrate how to solve them numerically by using an iterative finite-difference approach.", "published": "2019-07-17 02:13:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07305v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
