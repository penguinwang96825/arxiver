{"title": "Joint Named Entity Recognition and Stance Detection in Tweets", "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a well-established task of information\nextraction which has been studied for decades. More recently, studies reporting\nNER experiments on social media texts have emerged. On the other hand, stance\ndetection is a considerably new research topic usually considered within the\nscope of sentiment analysis. Stance detection studies are mostly applied to\ntexts of online debates where the stance of the text owner for a particular\ntarget, either explicitly or implicitly mentioned in text, is explored. In this\nstudy, we investigate the possible contribution of named entities to the stance\ndetection task in tweets. We report the evaluation results of NER experiments\nas well as that of the subsequent stance detection experiments using named\nentities, on a publicly-available stance-annotated data set of tweets. Our\nresults indicate that named entities obtained with a high-performance NER\nsystem can contribute to stance detection performance on tweets.", "published": "2017-07-30 11:34:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09611v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
