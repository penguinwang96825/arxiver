{"title": "Towards a general mathematical theory of experimental science", "abstract": "We lay the groundwork for a formal framework that studies scientific theories and can serve as a unified foundation for the different theories within physics. We define a scientific theory as a set of verifiable statements, assertions that can be shown to be true with an experimental test in finite time. By studying the algebra of such objects, we show that verifiability already provides severe constraints. In particular, it requires that a set of physically distinguishable cases is naturally equipped with the mathematical structures (i.e. second-countable Kolmogorov topologies and $\u03c3$-algebras) that form the foundation of manifold theory, differential geometry, measure theory, probability theory and all the major branches of mathematics currently used in physics. This gives a clear physical meaning to those mathematical structures and provides a strong justification for their use in science. Most importantly it provides a formal framework to incorporate additional assumptions and constrain the search space for new physical theories.", "published": "2018-06-22 14:05:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07896v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "physics.hist-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "A New ECOC Algorithm for Multiclass Microarray Data Classification", "abstract": "The classification of multi-class microarray datasets is a hard task because of the small samples size in each class and the heavy overlaps among classes. To effectively solve these problems, we propose novel Error Correcting Output Code (ECOC) algorithm by Enhance Class Separability related Data Complexity measures during encoding process, named as ECOCECS. In this algorithm, two nearest neighbor related DC measures are deployed to extract the intrinsic overlapping information from microarray data. Our ECOC algorithm aims to search an optimal class split scheme by minimizing these measures. The class splitting process ends when each class is separated from others, and then the class assignment scheme is mapped as a coding matrix. Experiments are carried out on five microarray datasets, and results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in comparison with six state-of-art ECOC methods. In short, our work confirm the probability of applying DC to ECOC framework.", "published": "2018-06-22 01:29:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03233v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
