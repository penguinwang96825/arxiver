{"title": "TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework", "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using\nsocieties of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance,\nefforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or\nmulti-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent\nsystems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative\ndynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading\nframework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in\nspecialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical\nanalysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull\nand Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team\nmonitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and\nhistorical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic,\ncollaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading\nperformance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its\nsuperiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative\nreturns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of\nmulti-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

{"title": "Optimal Execution Strategies Incorporating Internal Liquidity Through Market Making", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new algorithmic execution model that integrates\ninterbank limit and market orders with internal liquidity generated through\nmarket making. Based on the Cartea et al.\\cite{cartea2015algorithmic}\nframework, we incorporate market impact in interbank orders while excluding it\nfor internal market-making transactions. Our model aims to optimize the balance\nbetween interbank and internal liquidity, reducing market impact and improving\nexecution efficiency.", "published": "2024-12-28 03:07:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07581v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
