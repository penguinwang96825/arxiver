{"title": "Deep Speaker Vectors for Semi Text-independent Speaker Verification", "abstract": "Recent research shows that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to extract\ndeep speaker vectors (d-vectors) that preserve speaker characteristics and can\nbe used in speaker verification. This new method has been tested on\ntext-dependent speaker verification tasks, and improvement was reported when\ncombined with the conventional i-vector method.\n  This paper extends the d-vector approach to semi text-independent speaker\nverification tasks, i.e., the text of the speech is in a limited set of short\nphrases. We explore various settings of the DNN structure used for d-vector\nextraction, and present a phone-dependent training which employs the posterior\nfeatures obtained from an ASR system. The experimental results show that it is\npossible to apply d-vectors on semi text-independent speaker recognition, and\nthe phone-dependent training improves system performance.", "published": "2015-05-24 11:22:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06427v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
