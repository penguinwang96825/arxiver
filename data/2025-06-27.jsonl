In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition.

While higher Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers employ\nmeasures like encryption and secure protocols to address data security,\nPhysical-Layer Security (PLS) focuses on preventing information leakage to\nEavesDroppers (EDs) and mitigating the effects of jammers and spoofing attacks.\nIn this context, the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces\n(RISs) can play an instrumental role, enhancing PLS by intelligently reflecting\nelectromagnetic waves to benefit Legitimate Users (LUs) while obstructing EDs.\nThis paper presents practical indoor measurements to evaluate the capability of\nan RIS to enhance PLS, focusing on a varactor-based RIS technology designed for\nthe FR1 band at 3.55 GHz. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art RIS-aided\nsecrecy optimization algorithms together with a novel approach designed in this\npaper, which relies on a newly generated RIS phase configuration codebook,\nhighlight the potential of RISs to improve both data rates for LUs as well as\nsecrecy against EDs in real-world indoor multipath environments.

{"title": "Hybrid Constellation Modulation for Symbol-Level Precoding in RIS-Enhanced MU-MISO Systems", "abstract": "The application of symbol-level precoding (SLP) in reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RIS) enhanced multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)\nsystems faces two main challenges. First, the state-of-the-art joint reflecting\nand SLP optimization approach requires exhaustive enumeration of all possible\ntransmit symbol combinations, resulting in scalability issues as the modulation\norder and number of users increase. Second, conventional quadrature amplitude\nmodulation (QAM) exhibits strict constructive interference (CI) regions,\nlimiting its effectiveness for CI exploitation in SLP. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, termed\nhybrid-constellation modulation (HCM), which has a structure of superposed QAM\nand ASK sub-constellations (SCs). HCM extends the CI regions compared to QAM.\nAdditionally, a two-stage reflecting and SLP optimization method is developed\nto support HCM. The proposed methods are designed for practical RIS with\ndiscrete phase shifts and has good scalability. Simulation results show that\nHCM achieves up to 1.5 dB and 1 dB SER gains over QAM with modulation order 16\nand 64, respectively.", "published": "2025-06-27 09:55:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22059v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Evaluating Redundancy Mitigation in Vulnerable Road User Awareness Messages for Bicycles", "abstract": "V2X communication has become crucial for enhancing road safety, especially\nfor Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) such as pedestrians and cyclists. However, the\nincreasing number of devices communicating on the same channels will lead to\nsignificant channel load. To address this issue this study evaluates the\neffectiveness of Redundancy Mitigation (RM) for VRU Awareness Messages (VAM),\nfocusing specifically on cyclists. The objective of RM is to minimize the\ntransmission of redundant information. We conducted a simulation study using a\nurban scenario with a high bicycle density based on traffic data from Hannover,\nGermany. This study assessed the impact of RM on channel load, measured by\nChannel Busy Ratio (CBR), and safety, measured by VRU Perception Rate (VPR) in\nsimulation. To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RM mechanisms, we\nanalyzed the actual differences in position, speed, and heading between the ego\nVRU and the VRU, which was assumed to be redundant. Our findings indicate that\nwhile RM can reduce channel congestion, it also leads to a decrease in VPR. The\nanalysis of actual differences revealed that the RM mechanism standardized by\nETSI often uses outdated information, leading to significant discrepancies in\nposition, speed, and heading, which could result in dangerous situations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose an adapted RM mechanism that improves the\nbalance between reducing channel load and maintaining VRU awareness. The\nadapted approach shows a significant reduction in maximum CBR and a less\nsignificant decrease in VPR compared to the standardized RM. Moreover, it\ndemonstrates better performance in the actual differences in position, speed,\nand heading, thereby enhancing overall safety. Our results highlight the need\nfor further research to optimize RM techniques and ensure they effectively\nenhance V2X communication without compromising the safety of VRUs.", "published": "2025-06-27 09:47:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22052v1", "categories": ["cs.ET", "cs.NI", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.ET"}

In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid neural receiver\n(H-NR) built on Transformer encoder blocks and Graph Neural Network (GNN), as\npart of an end-to-end wireless communication framework. In our communication\nframework, we assume vehicle to network (V2N) uplink scenario where information\nis transmitted by vehicle and received at the base station (BS). Our proposed\nH-NR model replace OFDM resource grid demapping, channel estimation, signal\nequalization, demodulation, and channel decoding. To test the adaptability of\nour proposed model on unseen conditions, we evaluate its performance for\nvarious scenarios, including a vehicle speed of range [0-60] km/h, a carrier\nfrequency of 5.9GHz, and a cluster delay line (CDL) channel model. Furthermore,\nwe assess the performance of our proposed H-NR on multimodal data, such as\nimages, audio, GPS, radar, and LiDAR, to examine its adaptability in real-world\nuse cases. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that our proposed model\noutperforms the state-of-the-art neural receiver by approximately 0.5 dB in\nterms of reconstruction and error correction.", "published": "2025-06-27 07:44:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21983v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Movable Antennas-aided Wireless Energy Transfer for the Internet of Things", "abstract": "Recent advancements in movable antennas (MAs) technology create new\nopportunities for 6G and beyond wireless systems. MAs are promising for radio\nfrequency wireless energy transfer because they can dynamically adjust antenna\npositions, improving energy efficiency and scalability. This work aims to\nminimize the power consumed by an analog beamforming power beacon equipped with\nindependently-controlled MAs (IMAs) for charging multiple single-antenna\ndevices. To this end, we enforce a minimum separation among antennas and a\nminimum received power at the devices. The resulting optimization problem is\nnonlinear and nonconvex due to interdependencies among the variables. To tackle\nthis, we propose a semidefinite program guided particle swarm optimization\n(SgPSO) algorithm where each particle represents an antenna configuration, and\nthe fitness function optimizes the corresponding power allocation. SgPSO is\nutilized for configuring the MAs largely outperforming fixed array\nimplementations, particularly with more antennas or devices. We also present an\nalternative implementation using uniformly-spaced MAs, whose performance\nclosely approaches that of the IMAs, with the gap widening only as the number\nof devices grows. We also examine how increasing the number of antennas\npromotes near-field conditions, which decrease as devices become more widely\ndistributed.", "published": "2025-06-27 07:13:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21966v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Improving Convergence for Semi-Federated Learning: An Energy-Efficient Approach by Manipulating Over-the-Air Distortion", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning framework that combines federated\nand split learning, termed semi-federated learning (SemiFL), in which\nover-the-air computation is utilized for gradient aggregation. A key idea is to\nstrategically adjust the learning rate by manipulating over-the-air distortion\nfor improving SemiFL's convergence. Specifically, we intentionally amplify\namplitude distortion to increase the learning rate in the non-stable region,\nthereby accelerating convergence and reducing communication energy consumption.\nIn the stable region, we suppress noise perturbation to maintain a small\nlearning rate for improving SemiFL's final convergence. Theoretical results\ndemonstrate the antagonistic effects of over-the-air distortion in different\nregions, under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and\nnon-i.i.d. data settings. Then, we formulate two energy consumption\nminimization problems, one for each region, which implements a two-region mean\nsquare error threshold configuration scheme. Accordingly, we propose two\nresource allocation algorithms with closed-form solutions. Simulation results\nshow that under different network and data distribution conditions,\nstrategically manipulating over-the-air distortion can efficiently adjust the\nlearning rate to improve SemiFL's convergence. Moreover, energy consumption can\nbe reduced by using the proposed algorithms.", "published": "2025-06-27 04:21:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21893v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
