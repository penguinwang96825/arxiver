{"title": "Choice of Mel Filter Bank in Computing MFCC of a Resampled Speech", "abstract": "Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are the most popularly used\nspeech features in most speech and speaker recognition applications. In this\npaper, we study the effect of resampling a speech signal on these speech\nfeatures. We first derive a relationship between the MFCC param- eters of the\nresampled speech and the MFCC parameters of the original speech. We propose six\nmethods of calculating the MFCC parameters of downsampled speech by\ntransforming the Mel filter bank used to com- pute MFCC of the original speech.\nWe then experimentally compute the MFCC parameters of the down sampled speech\nusing the proposed meth- ods and compute the Pearson coefficient between the\nMFCC parameters of the downsampled speech and that of the original speech to\nidentify the most effective choice of Mel-filter band that enables the computed\nMFCC of the resampled speech to be as close as possible to the original speech\nsample MFCC.", "published": "2014-10-25 09:40:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6903v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "Modified Mel Filter Bank to Compute MFCC of Subsampled Speech", "abstract": "Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are the most popularly used\nspeech features in most speech and speaker recognition applications. In this\nwork, we propose a modified Mel filter bank to extract MFCCs from subsampled\nspeech. We also propose a stronger metric which effectively captures the\ncorrelation between MFCCs of original speech and MFCC of resampled speech. It\nis found that the proposed method of filter bank construction performs\ndistinguishably well and gives recognition performance on resampled speech\nclose to recognition accuracies on original speech.", "published": "2014-10-25 10:00:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7382v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
