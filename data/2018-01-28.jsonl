{"title": "Multi-Pointer Co-Attention Networks for Recommendation", "abstract": "Many recent state-of-the-art recommender systems such as D-ATT, TransNet and\nDeepCoNN exploit reviews for representation learning. This paper proposes a new\nneural architecture for recommendation with reviews. Our model operates on a\nmulti-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews\nare created equal, i.e., only a select few are important. The importance,\nhowever, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To\nthis end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that\nextracts important reviews, subsequently matching them in a word-by-word\nfashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for\nprediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method\noperates with a novel gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the\nincorporation of discrete vectors within differentiable neural architectures.\nOur pointer mechanism is co-attentive in nature, learning pointers which are\nco-dependent on user-item relationships. Finally, we propose a multi-pointer\nlearning scheme that learns to combine multiple views of interactions between\nuser and item. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model\nvia extensive experiments on \\textbf{24} benchmark datasets from Amazon and\nYelp. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art, with up to 19% and 71% relative improvement when\ncompared to TransNet and DeepCoNN respectively. We study the behavior of our\nmulti-pointer learning mechanism, shedding light on evidence aggregation\npatterns in review-based recommender systems.", "published": "2018-01-28 17:14:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09251v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
