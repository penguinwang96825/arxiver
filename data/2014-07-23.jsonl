{"title": "Autonomous requirements specification processing using natural language\n  processing", "abstract": "We describe our ongoing research that centres on the application of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) to software engineering and systems development\nactivities. In particular, this paper addresses the use of NLP in the\nrequirements analysis and systems design processes. We have developed a\nprototype toolset that can assist the systems analyst or software engineer to\nselect and verify terms relevant to a project. In this paper we describe the\nprocesses employed by the system to extract and classify objects of interest\nfrom requirements documents. These processes are illustrated using a small\nexample.", "published": "2014-07-23 03:29:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6099v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
