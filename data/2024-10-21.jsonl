{"title": "Inferring Option Movements Through Residual Transactions: A Quantitative Model", "abstract": "This research presents a novel approach to predicting option movements by\nanalyzing residual transactions, which are trades that deviate from standard\nhedging activities. Unlike traditional methods that primarily focus on open\ninterest and trading volume, this study argues that residuals can reveal\nnuanced insights into institutional sentiment and strategic positioning. By\nexamining these deviations, the model identifies early indicators of market\ntrends, providing a refined framework for forecasting option prices. The\nproposed model integrates classical machine learning and regression techniques\nto analyze patterns in high frequency trading data, capturing complex, non\nlinear relationships. This predictive framework allows traders to anticipate\nshifts in option values, enhancing strategies for better market timing, risk\nmanagement, and portfolio optimization. The model's adaptability, driven by\nreal time data processing, makes it particularly effective in fast paced\ntrading environments, where early detection of institutional behavior is\ncrucial for gaining a competitive edge. Overall, this research contributes to\nthe field of options trading by offering a strategic tool that detects early\nmarket signals, optimizing trading decisions based on predictive insights\nderived from residual trading patterns. This approach bridges the gap between\nconventional metrics and the subtle behaviors of institutional players, marking\na significant advancement in options market analysis.", "published": "2024-10-21 22:47:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16563v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "91G20", "I.5.1"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Time evaluation of portfolio for asymmetrically informed traders", "abstract": "We study the anticipating version of the classical portfolio optimization\nproblem in a financial market with the presence of a trader who possesses\nprivileged information about the future (insider information), but who is also\nsubjected to a delay in the information flow about the market conditions; hence\nthis trader possesses an asymmetric information with respect to the traditional\none. We analyze it via the Russo-Vallois forward stochastic integral, i. e.\nusing anticipating stochastic calculus, along with a white noise approach. We\nexplicitly compute the optimal portfolios that maximize the expected\nlogarithmic utility assuming different classical financial models:\nBlack-Scholes-Merton, Heston, Vasicek. Similar results hold for other\nwell-known models, such as the Hull-White and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross ones. Our\ncomparison between the performance of the traditional trader and the insider,\nalthough only asymmetrically informed, reveals that the privileged information\novercompensates the delay in all cases, provided only one information flow is\ndelayed. However, when two information flows are delayed, a competition between\nfuture information and delay magnitude enters into play, implying that the best\nperformance depends on the parameter values. This, in turn, allows us to value\nfuture information in terms of time, and not only utility.", "published": "2024-10-21 13:42:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16010v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "60H05, 60H07, 60H10, 60H40, 91G10, 91G80"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}

{"title": "A Dynamic Spatiotemporal and Network ARCH Model with Common Factors", "abstract": "We introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal volatility model that extends\ntraditional approaches by incorporating spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal\nspillover effects, along with volatility-specific observed and latent factors.\nThe model offers a more general network interpretation, making it applicable\nfor studying various types of network spillovers. The primary innovation lies\nin incorporating volatility-specific latent factors into the dynamic\nspatiotemporal volatility model. Using Bayesian estimation via the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) method, the model offers a robust framework for analyzing\nthe spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal effects of a log-squared outcome\nvariable on its volatility. We recommend using the deviance information\ncriterion (DIC) and a regularized Bayesian MCMC method to select the number of\nrelevant factors in the model. The model's flexibility is demonstrated through\ntwo applications: a spatiotemporal model applied to the U.S. housing market and\nanother applied to financial stock market networks, both highlighting the\nmodel's ability to capture varying degrees of interconnectedness. In both\napplications, we find strong spatial/network interactions with relatively\nstronger spillover effects in the stock market.", "published": "2024-10-21 21:35:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16526v1", "categories": ["stat.ME", "econ.EM", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "stat.ME"}
{"title": "Modelling financial returns with mixtures of generalized normal distributions", "abstract": "This PhD Thesis presents an investigation into the analysis of financial\nreturns using mixture models, focusing on mixtures of generalized normal\ndistributions (MGND) and their extensions. The study addresses several critical\nissues encountered in the estimation process and proposes innovative solutions\nto enhance accuracy and efficiency. In Chapter 2, the focus lies on the MGND\nmodel and its estimation via expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and\ngeneralized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithms. A thorough exploration\nreveals a degeneracy issue when estimating the shape parameter. Several\nalgorithms are proposed to overcome this critical issue. Chapter 3 extends the\ntheoretical perspective by applying the MGND model on several stock market\nindices. A two-step approach is proposed for identifying turmoil days and\nestimating returns and volatility. Chapter 4 introduces constrained mixture of\ngeneralized normal distributions (CMGND), enhancing interpretability and\nefficiency by imposing constraints on parameters. Simulation results highlight\nthe benefits of constrained parameter estimation. Finally, Chapter 5 introduces\ngeneralized normal distribution-hidden Markov models (GND-HMMs) able to capture\nthe dynamic nature of financial returns. This manuscript contributes to the\nstatistical modelling of financial returns by offering flexible, parsimonious,\nand interpretable frameworks. The proposed mixture models capture complex\npatterns in financial data, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making\nin financial analysis and risk management.", "published": "2024-10-21 18:04:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11847v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "stat.ME"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Forecasting Company Fundamentals", "abstract": "Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall\nsuccess and stability.
