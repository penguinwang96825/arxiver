{"title": "Combinatorial and Algorithmic Properties of One Matrix Structure at Monotone Boolean Functions", "abstract": "One matrix structure in the area of monotone Boolean functions is defined here. Some of its combinatorial, algebraic and algorithmic properties are derived. On the base of these properties, three algorithms are built. First of them generates all monotone Boolean functions of $n$ variables in lexicographic order. The second one determines the first (resp. the last) lexicographically minimal true (resp. maximal false) vector of an unknown monotone function $f$ of $n$ variables. The algorithm uses at most $n$ membership queries and its running time is $\u0398(n)$. It serves the third algorithm, which identifies an unknown monotone Boolean function $f$ of $n$ variables by using membership queries only. The experimental results show that for $1\\leq n\\leq 6$, the algorithm determines $f$ by using at most $m.n$ queries, where $m$ is the combined size of the sets of minimal true and maximal false vectors of $f$.", "published": "2019-02-16 15:04:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06110v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "PT-ISABB: A Hybrid Tree-based Complete Algorithm to Solve Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems", "abstract": "Asymmetric Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (ADCOPs) have emerged as an important formalism in multi-agent community due to their ability to capture personal preferences. However, the existing search-based complete algorithms for ADCOPs can only use local knowledge to compute lower bounds, which leads to inefficient pruning and prohibits them from solving large scale problems. On the other hand, inference-based complete algorithms (e.g., DPOP) for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) require only a linear number of messages, but they cannot be directly applied into ADCOPs due to a privacy concern. Therefore, in the paper, we consider the possibility of combining inference and search to effectively solve ADCOPs at an acceptable loss of privacy. Specifically, we propose a hybrid complete algorithm called PT-ISABB which uses a tailored inference algorithm to provide tight lower bounds and a tree-based complete search algorithm to exhaust the search space. We prove the correctness of our algorithm and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art complete algorithms.", "published": "2019-02-16 04:30:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06039v4", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
