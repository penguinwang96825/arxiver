{"title": "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT", "abstract": "Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model, ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.", "published": "2020-04-27 14:21:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Differentiable Adaptive Computation Time for Visual Reasoning", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel attention-based algorithm for achieving adaptive computation called DACT, which, unlike existing ones, is end-to-end differentiable. Our method can be used in conjunction with many networks; in particular, we study its application to the widely known MAC architecture, obtaining a significant reduction in the number of recurrent steps needed to achieve similar accuracies, therefore improving its performance to computation ratio. Furthermore, we show that by increasing the maximum number of steps used, we surpass the accuracy of even our best non-adaptive MAC in the CLEVR dataset, demonstrating that our approach is able to control the number of steps without significant loss of performance. Additional advantages provided by our approach include considerably improving interpretability by discarding useless steps and providing more insights into the underlying reasoning process. Finally, we present adaptive computation as an equivalent to an ensemble of models, similar to a mixture of expert formulation. Both the code and the configuration files for our experiments are made available to support further research in this area.", "published": "2020-04-27 13:20:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12770v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Control Design of Autonomous Drone Using Deep Learning Based Image Understanding Techniques", "abstract": "This paper presents a new framework to use images as the inputs for the controller to have autonomous flight, considering the noisy indoor environment and uncertainties. A new Proportional-Integral-Derivative-Accelerated (PIDA) control with a derivative filter is proposed to improves drone/quadcopter flight stability within a noisy environment and enables autonomous flight using object and depth detection techniques. The mathematical model is derived from an accurate model with a high level of fidelity by addressing the problems of non-linearity, uncertainties, and coupling. The proposed PIDA controller is tuned by Stochastic Dual Simplex Algorithm (SDSA) to support autonomous flight. The simulation results show that adapting the deep learning-based image understanding techniques (RetinaNet ant colony detection and PSMNet) to the proposed controller can enable the generation and tracking of the desired point in the presence of environmental disturbances.", "published": "2020-04-27 15:50:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12886v3", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CV", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
{"title": "Generalization of Affine Feedback Stock Trading Results to Include Stop-Loss Orders", "abstract": "The takeoff point of this paper is to generalize the existing stock trading results for a class of affine feedback controller to include consideration of a stop-loss order. Using the geometric Brownian motion as the underlying stock price model, our main result is to provide a closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function for the trading profit or loss. In addition, we show that the affine feedback controller with stop-loss order indeed generalizes the result without stop order in the sense of distribution function. Some simulations and illustrative examples are also provided as supporting evidence of the theory. Moreover, we provide some technical results aimed at addressing the issues about survivability, cash-financing considerations, long-only property, and lower bound of the expected gain or loss.", "published": "2020-04-27 14:57:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12848v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "eess.SY", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "Autoencoding Neural Networks as Musical Audio Synthesizers", "abstract": "A method for musical audio synthesis using autoencoding neural networks is proposed. The autoencoder is trained to compress and reconstruct magnitude short-time Fourier transform frames. The autoencoder produces a spectrogram by activating its smallest hidden layer, and a phase response is calculated using real-time phase gradient heap integration. Taking an inverse short-time Fourier transform produces the audio signal. Our algorithm is light-weight when compared to current state-of-the-art audio-producing machine learning algorithms. We outline our design process, produce metrics, and detail an open-source Python implementation of our model.", "published": "2020-04-27 20:58:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13172v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Time-Frequency Analysis and Parameterisation of Knee Sounds for Non-invasive Detection of Osteoarthritis", "abstract": "Objective: In this work the potential of non-invasive detection of knee osteoarthritis is investigated using the sounds generated by the knee joint during walking. Methods: The information contained in the time-frequency domain of these signals and its compressed representations is exploited and their discriminant properties are studied. Their efficacy for the task of normal vs abnormal signal classification is evaluated using a comprehensive experimental framework. Based on this, the impact of the feature extraction parameters on the classification performance is investigated using Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Results: It is shown that classification is successful with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.92. Conclusion: The analysis indicates improvements in classification performance when using non-uniform frequency scaling and identifies specific frequency bands that contain discriminative features. Significance: Contrary to other studies that focus on sit-to-stand movements and knee flexion/extension, this study used knee sounds obtained during walking. The analysis of such signals leads to non-invasive detection of knee osteoarthritis with high accuracy and could potentially extend the range of available tools for the assessment of the disease as a more practical and cost effective method without requiring clinical setups.", "published": "2020-04-27 12:40:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12745v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
