{"title": "Crossing penalised CAViaR", "abstract": "Dynamic quantiles, or Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk (CAViaR)\nmodels, have been extensively studied at the individual level. However, efforts\nto estimate multiple dynamic quantiles jointly have been limited. Existing\napproaches either sequentially estimate fitted quantiles or impose restrictive\nassumptions on the data generating process. This paper fills this gap by\nproposing an objective function for the joint estimation of all quantiles,\nintroducing a crossing penalty to guide the process. Monte Carlo experiments\nand an empirical application on the FTSE100 validate the effectiveness of the\nmethod, offering a flexible and robust approach to modelling multiple dynamic\nquantiles in time-series data.", "published": "2025-01-17 21:43:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10564v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "stat.ME"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Lead Times in Flux: Analyzing Airbnb Booking Dynamics During Global Upheavals (2018-2022)", "abstract": "Short-term shifts in booking behaviors can disrupt forecasting in the travel\nand hospitality industry, especially during global crises. Traditional metrics\nlike average or median lead times often overlook important distribution\nchanges. This study introduces a normalized L1 (Manhattan) distance to assess\nAirbnb booking lead time divergences from 2018 to 2022, focusing on the\nCOVID-19 pandemic across four major U.S. cities. We identify a two-phase\ndisruption: an abrupt change at the pandemic's onset followed by partial\nrecovery with persistent deviations from pre-2018 patterns. Our method reveals\nchanges in travelers' planning horizons that standard statistics miss,\nhighlighting the need to analyze the entire lead-time distribution for more\naccurate demand forecasting and pricing strategies. The normalized L1 metric\nprovides valuable insights for tourism stakeholders navigating ongoing market\nvolatility.", "published": "2025-01-17 20:16:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10535v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
