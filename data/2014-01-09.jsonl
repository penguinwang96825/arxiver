{"title": "Statistical Analysis based Hypothesis Testing Method in Biological\n  Knowledge Discovery", "abstract": "The correlation and interactions among different biological entities comprise\nthe biological system. Although already revealed interactions contribute to the\nunderstanding of different existing systems, researchers face many questions\neveryday regarding inter-relationships among entities. Their queries have\npotential role in exploring new relations which may open up a new area of\ninvestigation. In this paper, we introduce a text mining based method for\nanswering the biological queries in terms of statistical computation such that\nresearchers can come up with new knowledge discovery. It facilitates user to\nsubmit their query in natural linguistic form which can be treated as\nhypothesis. Our proposed approach analyzes the hypothesis and measures the\np-value of the hypothesis with respect to the existing literature. Based on the\nmeasured value, the system either accepts or rejects the hypothesis from\nstatistical point of view. Moreover, even it does not find any direct\nrelationship among the entities of the hypothesis, it presents a network to\ngive an integral overview of all the entities through which the entities might\nbe related. This is also congenial for the researchers to widen their view and\nthus think of new hypothesis for further investigation. It assists researcher\nto get a quantitative evaluation of their assumptions such that they can reach\na logical conclusion and thus aids in relevant re-searches of biological\nknowledge discovery. The system also provides the researchers a graphical\ninteractive interface to submit their hypothesis for assessment in a more\nconvenient way.", "published": "2014-01-09 18:05:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2851v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
