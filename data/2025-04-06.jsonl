We say an independent set in such a hypergraph is\nbalanced if it contains an equal number of vertices from each partition. The\nbalanced chromatic number of $H$ is the minimum value $q$ such that $H$ admits\na proper $q$-coloring where each color class is a balanced independent set. In\nthis note, we determine the asymptotic behavior of the balanced chromatic\nnumber for sparse $r$-uniform $r$-partite Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi hypergraphs. A key\nstep in our proof is to show that any balanced colorable hypergraph of average\ndegree $d$ admits a proper balanced coloring with $r(r-1)d + 1$ colors.

While traditional shortest path algorithms optimize only distance, our\napproach leverages Binary-Addition-Tree ordering to efficiently identify\nlexicographically smallest and largest paths that establish connectivity. These\npaths partition the solution space into three regions: guaranteed\ndisconnection, transitional connectivity, and guaranteed no simple paths. Our\nweight allocation enables implicit encoding of multiple objectives directly in\nbinary representations, maintaining the O((|V|+|E|)log|V|) complexity of\nDijkstra's algorithm while allowing simultaneous optimization of competing\nfactors like reliability and cost. Experimental validation demonstrates\nsignificant computational time reduction compared to traditional\nmulti-objective methods.

Given\navailable disturbance datasets, we leverage conformal prediction (CP) to\naddress the underlying chance-constrained multi-agent STL synthesis problem in\na distribution-free manner. By introducing nonconformity scores as functions of\nprediction regions (PRs) of error trajectories, we develop an iterative\nPR-scaling and disturbance-feedback synthesis approach to bound training error\ntrajectory samples. These bounds are then calibrated using a separate dataset,\nproviding probabilistic guarantees via CP. Subsequently, we relax the\nunderlying stochastic optimal control problem by tightening the robustness\nfunctions of collaborative tasks based on their Lipschitz constants and the\ncomputed error bounds. To address scalability, we exploit the compositional\nstructure of the multi-agent STL formula and propose a\nmodel-predictive-control-like algorithm, where agent-level problems are solved\nin a distributed fashion.
