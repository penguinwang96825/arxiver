{"title": "Unsupervised Keyword Extraction from Polish Legal Texts", "abstract": "In this work, we present an application of the recently proposed unsupervised\nkeyword extraction algorithm RAKE to a corpus of Polish legal texts from the\nfield of public procurement. RAKE is essentially a language and domain\nindependent method. Its only language-specific input is a stoplist containing a\nset of non-content words. The performance of the method heavily depends on the\nchoice of such a stoplist, which should be domain adopted. Therefore, we\ncomplement RAKE algorithm with an automatic approach to selecting non-content\nwords, which is based on the statistical properties of term distribution.", "published": "2014-08-16 10:09:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3731v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
