Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one).

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

Building on recent\nresearch, we first formulate a mixed integer program to maximize the number of\nparking stalls using a flow-based approach. Parking lots are rasterized into a\ngrid, and the proposed MIP model optimizes them in a generic manner, adapting\nto the grid resolution and stall size without the need for custom formulations.\nThe constraints ensure the connectivity of parking stalls and driveways to the\nentrance/exit. This formulation is then extended to the case of one-way driving\nlanes. We also propose valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm for\nthe one-way and two-way lane configurations. This approach eliminates flow\nvariables, big-M type constraints, and improves solution times for medium-sized\ninstances. The effectiveness of the suggested models is showcased on 325\nparking lots in New York City. For instances in which the flow version could be\nsolved in 15 minutes, the branch-and-cut algorithm improved the median runtimes\nby 87.43% for the one-way case and by 79.36% for the two-way case and resulted\nin better optimality gaps for the other instances, compared to the baseline\nflow-based formulation.

Specifically, the communication\nspectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath\nchannels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the\nspectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds\ncorresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the\npresence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the\nsymbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR\nvariation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the\nmaximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in\nterms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function.

In\nthis representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while\nedges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two\nmain steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to\nlearn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the\ngraph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by\npreviously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial\ncoordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes\nfeatures on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned\nstatistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,\nensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential\nfeatures of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst\nnetworks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the\ndatabase, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows\nstochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of\nformations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such\nas flow and transport.", "published": "2025-06-11 15:10:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09832v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

{"title": "Delegations as Adaptive Representation Patterns: Rethinking Influence in Liquid Democracy", "abstract": "Liquid democracy is a mechanism for the division of labor in decision-making\nthrough the transitive delegation of influence. In essence, all individuals\npossess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage\ndirectly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their\nchoosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging\nin liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the\ncapacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified\nas a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power.\n  Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the\nLiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence\nof voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the\nprocess nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting\nare distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel\nmodel of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact\ncontribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and\ndecision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for\nall votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is\nstemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an\nexponential trajectory.\n  In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous\nanalysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process.\nThe adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the\nexisting academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most\nimportant features. We therefore also outline a research agenda focusing on\nthis aspect of liquid democracy.", "published": "2025-06-11 14:34:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09789v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}

{"title": "S2ST-Omni: An Efficient and Scalable Multilingual Speech-to-Speech Translation Framework via Seamlessly Speech-Text Alignment and Streaming Speech Decoder", "abstract": "Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert\nspoken utterances from multiple source languages into fluent and intelligible\nspeech in a target language. Despite recent progress, several critical\nchallenges persist: 1) achieving high-quality and low-latency S2ST remains a\nsignificant obstacle; 2) most existing S2ST methods rely heavily on large-scale\nparallel speech corpora, which are difficult and resource-intensive to obtain.\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce S2ST-Omni, a novel, efficient, and\nscalable framework tailored for multilingual speech-to-speech translation. To\nenable high-quality S2TT while mitigating reliance on large-scale parallel\nspeech corpora, we leverage powerful pretrained models: Whisper for robust\naudio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text comprehension. A lightweight\nspeech adapter is introduced to bridge the modality gap between speech and text\nrepresentations, facilitating effective utilization of pretrained multimodal\nknowledge. To ensure both translation accuracy and real-time responsiveness, we\nadopt a streaming speech decoder in the TTS stage, which generates the target\nspeech in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments conducted on the CVSS\nbenchmark demonstrate that S2ST-Omni consistently surpasses several\nstate-of-the-art S2ST baselines in translation quality, highlighting its\neffectiveness and superiority.", "published": "2025-06-11 17:44:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11160v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Incorporating Linguistic Constraints from External Knowledge Source for Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction", "abstract": "Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on\ntarget visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know\nthat humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to\nsupport speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of\npre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose\nincorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE\nmodel as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra\ncomputational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently\nimproves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our\nmethod in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show\nrobust performance gains.", "published": "2025-06-11 14:36:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09792v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.LG", "cs.MM", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
