{"title": "Co-channel Interference Management for the Next-Generation Heterogeneous Networks using Deep Leaning", "abstract": "The connectivity of public-safety mobile users (MU) in the co-existence of a public-safety network (PSN), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and LTE-based railway networks (LRN) needs a thorough investigation. UAVs are deployed as mobile base stations (BSs) for cell-edge coverage enhancement for MU. The co-existence of heterogeneous networks gives rise to the issue of co-channel interference due to the utilization of the same frequency band. By considering both sharing and non-sharing of radio access channels (RAC), we analyze co-channel interference in the downlink system of PSN, UAV, and LRN. As the LRN control signal demands high reliability and low latency, we provide higher priority to LRN users when allocating resources from the LRN RAC shared with MUs. Moreover, UAVs are deployed at the cell edge to increase the performance of cell-edge users. Therefore, interference control techniques enable LRN, PSN, and UAVs to cohabit in a scenario of sharing RAC. By offloading more PSN UEs to the LRN or UAVs, the resource utilization of the LRN and UAVs BSs is enhanced. In this paper, we aim to adopt deep learning (DL) based on enhanced inter-cell-interference coordination (eICIC) and further enhanced ICIC (FeICIC) strategies to deal with the interference from the PSN to the LRN and UAVs. Among LRN, PSN BS, and UAVs, a DL-based coordinated multipoint (CoMP) link technique is utilized to enhance the performance of PSN MUs. Therefore, if radio access channels are shared, utilization of DL-based FeICIC and CoMP for coordinated scheduling gives the best performance.", "published": "2023-01-06 16:55:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10177v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
