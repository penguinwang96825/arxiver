{"title": "Exploring the Role of Logically Related Non-Question Phrases for\n  Answering Why-Questions", "abstract": "In this paper, we show that certain phrases although not present in a given\nquestion/query, play a very important role in answering the question. Exploring\nthe role of such phrases in answering questions not only reduces the dependency\non matching question phrases for extracting answers, but also improves the\nquality of the extracted answers. Here matching question phrases means phrases\nwhich co-occur in given question and candidate answers. To achieve the above\ndiscussed goal, we introduce a bigram-based word graph model populated with\nsemantic and topical relatedness of terms in the given document. Next, we apply\nan improved version of ranking with a prior-based approach, which ranks all\nwords in the candidate document with respect to a set of root words (i.e.\nnon-stopwords present in the question and in the candidate document). As a\nresult, terms logically related to the root words are scored higher than terms\nthat are not related to the root words. Experimental results show that our\ndevised system performs better than state-of-the-art for the task of answering\nWhy-questions.", "published": "2013-03-29 06:31:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7310v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "H.3.m"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
