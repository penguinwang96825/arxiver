{"title": "Towards a Generic Framework for the Development of Unicode Based Digital\n  Sindhi Dictionaries", "abstract": "Dictionaries are essence of any language providing vital linguistic recourse\nfor the language learners, researchers and scholars. This paper focuses on the\nmethodology and techniques used in developing software architecture for a\nUBSESD (Unicode Based Sindhi to English and English to Sindhi Dictionary). The\nproposed system provides an accurate solution for construction and\nrepresentation of Unicode based Sindhi characters in a dictionary implementing\nHash Structure algorithm and a custom java Object as its internal data\nstructure saved in a file. The System provides facilities for Insertion,\nDeletion and Editing of new records of Sindhi. Through this framework any type\nof Sindhi to English and English to Sindhi Dictionary (belonging to different\ndomains of knowledge, e.g. engineering, medicine, computer, biology etc.) could\nbe developed easily with accurate representation of Unicode Characters in font\nindependent manner.", "published": "2014-01-12 16:49:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2641v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Dictionary-Based Concept Mining: An Application for Turkish", "abstract": "In this study, a dictionary-based method is used to extract expressive\nconcepts from documents. So far, there have been many studies concerning\nconcept mining in English, but this area of study for Turkish, an agglutinative\nlanguage, is still immature. We used dictionary instead of WordNet, a lexical\ndatabase grouping words into synsets that is widely used for concept\nextraction. The dictionaries are rarely used in the domain of concept mining,\nbut taking into account that dictionary entries have synonyms, hypernyms,\nhyponyms and other relationships in their meaning texts, the success rate has\nbeen high for determining concepts. This concept extraction method is\nimplemented on documents, that are collected from different corpora.", "published": "2014-01-12 19:52:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2663v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Sentiment Analysis Using Collaborated Opinion Mining", "abstract": "Opinion mining and Sentiment analysis have emerged as a field of study since\nthe widespread of World Wide Web and internet. Opinion refers to extraction of\nthose lines or phrase in the raw and huge data which express an opinion.\nSentiment analysis on the other hand identifies the polarity of the opinion\nbeing extracted. In this paper we propose the sentiment analysis in\ncollaboration with opinion extraction, summarization, and tracking the records\nof the students. The paper modifies the existing algorithm in order to obtain\nthe collaborated opinion about the students. The resultant opinion is\nrepresented as very high, high, moderate, low and very low. The paper is based\non a case study where teachers give their remarks about the students and by\napplying the proposed sentiment analysis algorithm the opinion is extracted and\nrepresented.", "published": "2014-01-12 12:35:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2618v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
