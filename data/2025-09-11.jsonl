Second, Embodiment\nConstraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and\ncapacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid\nbut practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an\nembodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task\nplanning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding\nmechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective\nregulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling\ncontext-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable.

The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive\nmulti-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic\nheterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and\ncomprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,\ngiven their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios\nwith dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic\nheterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the\nspatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively\neliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a\nmulti-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future\nscenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The\nproposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION\nmulti-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2\nmulti-world forecasting benchmark.", "published": "2025-09-11 07:36:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09210v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been\nproposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this\nwork, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,\nwe construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under\n$\\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps\narise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to\nestablishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify\nthe polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides\ninsights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,\nand establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic\nblock models, and seriation models.", "published": "2025-09-11 11:07:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09353v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}

This design improves the data\ncollection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety.\nExtensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that\nSART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely\non human-collected demonstrations.

{"title": "Automated Tuning for Diffusion Inverse Problem Solvers without Generative Prior Retraining", "abstract": "Diffusion/score-based models have recently emerged as powerful generative\npriors for solving inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction.\nWhile their flexibility allows decoupling the measurement model from the\nlearned prior, their performance heavily depends on carefully tuned data\nfidelity weights, especially under fast sampling schedules with few denoising\nsteps. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which\nfail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep\nschedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling\n(ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights\nacross arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion\nprior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and\noptimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled\nmeasurements.

Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for\nlocalization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due\nto perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby\ndegrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method\ndirectly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts\nonly the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,\nmodern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples\nare similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they\nstill produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown\nscale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a\nscale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the\ncorrespondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera\npose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves\nsuperior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as\ncross-area generalization and unknown orientation.

Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the\nheadband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest\nagreement for angular velocities (0.79 \\pm 0.08) and translational\naccelerations (0.73 \\pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \\pm\n0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and\nmouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading)\nfor the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1%\nfor the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the\ninstrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some\nkinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving\nthe headband performance across all kinematic measures.", "published": "2025-09-11 20:48:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09842v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "physics.med-ph"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Real-Time Remote Tracking with State-Dependent Detection Probability: A POMDP Framework", "abstract": "We consider a real-time tracking system where a binary Markov source is\nmonitored by two heterogeneous sensors. Upon command, sensors send their\nobservations to a remote sink over error-prone channels. We assume each sensor\nexhibits state-dependent detection accuracy and may occasionally fail to detect\nthe source state. At most one sensor is scheduled for sampling at each time\nslot. We assess the effectiveness of data communication using a generic\ndistortion function that captures the end application's objective. We derive\noptimal sink-side command policies to minimize the weighted sum of distortion\nand transmission costs. To model the uncertainty introduced by sensing failures\n(of the sensors) and packet loss, we formulate the problem as a partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP), which we then cast into a\nbelief-MDP. Since the belief evolves continuously, the belief space is\ndiscretized into a finite grid and the belief value is quantized to the nearest\ngrid point after each update. This formulation leads to a finite-state MDP\nproblem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA).\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy significantly\noutperforms benchmark strategies and highlights the importance of accounting\nfor state-dependent sensing reliability in sensor scheduling.", "published": "2025-09-11 20:33:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09837v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
