{"title": "RepreGuard: Detecting LLM-Generated Text by Revealing Hidden Representation Patterns", "abstract": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

{"title": "Signal and Noise: A Framework for Reducing Uncertainty in Language Model Evaluation", "abstract": "Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions\nwith small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation\nsuites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements.

In this paper, we introduce a\nmulti-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to\neffectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic\ninformation. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space\nvia a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the\nrepresentation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral\ncross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and\npseudo points.

Yet finding\nthese parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a\nsmall set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader\npicture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the\ndistribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.\nTo achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation\nerror inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter\ndistribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,\nreporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to\ntraining parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density\nestimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a\nlikelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter\nconfigurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the\nusability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing\nfeature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three\nsimulation datasets.

LOOP integrates 13 coordinated\nneural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,\nmulti-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical\ndecomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from\nboth successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL\nspecifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds\na causal knowledge base from execution traces.

We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In\nparticular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and\nthe uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning\nthe variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one\nvertex out of each part.

{"title": "Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation", "abstract": "Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of\na dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative\nmodeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear\nsettings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a\nsignificant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the\nensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible\ndesign of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates\nMC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to\nassimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF\ndesign compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show\nthat EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap\nparticle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on\nhigh-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy\ntradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our\nresults highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in\nhigh-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.", "published": "2025-08-18 19:00:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "60G35 (Primary), 62M20 (Secondary), 93E11"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Hierarchical Conformal Classification", "abstract": "Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty\nin machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample\ncoverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction\nset of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high\nprobability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose\nsolutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the\nhierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial\nnature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured\nsubset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding\noptimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of\naudio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a\nuser study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat\nprediction sets.", "published": "2025-08-18 18:05:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Towards Human-AI Complementarity in Matching Tasks", "abstract": "Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision\nmakers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes\napplication domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,\nexisting systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:\ndecisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not\nnecessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our\nwork aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching\n(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative\napproach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task\nlike existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most\nconfident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,\ncomatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the\nhuman decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale\nhuman subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.\nThe results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch\noutperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic\nmatching on their own.

Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this\nissue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal\nTransformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used\nin HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially\nresulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the\nactivity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize\nPhysically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.\nPPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose\nestimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics\nsimulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and\nhardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional\nSTDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,\nwe evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to\ntheir STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can\nreduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects\nused for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving\nmacro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive\nperformance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs.

In\nresponse, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment\nmodels with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.\nSpecifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac\nknowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these\nplans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific\ncustomization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine\nplans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as\ncomplex.
