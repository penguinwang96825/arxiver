{"title": "Statistical Complexity in Traveling Densities", "abstract": "In this work, we analyze the behavior of statistical complexity in several systems where two identical densities that travel in opposite direction cross each other. The crossing between two Gaussian, rectangular and triangular densities is studied in detail. For these three cases, the shape of the total density presenting an extreme value in complexity is found.", "published": "2009-12-28 16:06:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5187v1", "categories": ["nlin.PS", "cs.IT", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "nlin.PS"}
