{"title": "SeVeN: Augmenting Word Embeddings with Unsupervised Relation Vectors", "abstract": "We present SeVeN (Semantic Vector Networks), a hybrid resource that encodes\nrelationships between words in the form of a graph. Different from traditional\nsemantic networks, these relations are represented as vectors in a continuous\nvector space. We propose a simple pipeline for learning such relation vectors,\nwhich is based on word vector averaging in combination with an ad hoc\nautoencoder. We show that by explicitly encoding relational information in a\ndedicated vector space we can capture aspects of word meaning that are\ncomplementary to what is captured by word embeddings. For example, by examining\nclusters of relation vectors, we observe that relational similarities can be\nidentified at a more abstract level than with traditional word vector\ndifferences. Finally, we test the effectiveness of semantic vector networks in\ntwo tasks: measuring word similarity and neural text categorization. SeVeN is\navailable at bitbucket.org/luisespinosa/seven.", "published": "2018-08-18 10:23:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06068v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning to Compose over Tree Structures via POS Tags", "abstract": "Recursive Neural Network (RecNN), a type of models which compose words or\nphrases recursively over syntactic tree structures, has been proven to have\nsuperior ability to obtain sentence representation for a variety of NLP tasks.\nHowever, RecNN is born with a thorny problem that a shared compositional\nfunction for each node of trees can't capture the complex semantic\ncompositionality so that the expressive power of model is limited. In this\npaper, in order to address this problem, we propose Tag-Guided\nHyperRecNN/TreeLSTM (TG-HRecNN/TreeLSTM), which introduces hypernetwork into\nRecNNs to take as inputs Part-of-Speech (POS) tags of word/phrase and generate\nthe semantic composition parameters dynamically. Experimental results on five\ndatasets for two typical NLP tasks show proposed models both obtain significant\nimprovement compared with RecNN and TreeLSTM consistently. Our TG-HTreeLSTM\noutperforms all existing RecNN-based models and achieves or is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art on four sentence classification benchmarks. The effectiveness\nof our models is also demonstrated by qualitative analysis.", "published": "2018-08-18 11:53:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06075v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Emoji Sentiment Scores of Writers using Odds Ratio and Fisher Exact Test", "abstract": "The sentiment of a given emoji is traditionally calculated by averaging the\nratings {-1, 0 or +1} given by various users to a given context where the emoji\nappears. However, using such formula complicates the statistical significance\nanalysis particularly for low sample sizes. Here, we provide sentiment scores\nusing odds and a sentiment mapping to a 4-icon scale. We show how odds ratio\nstatistics leads to simpler sentiment analysis. Finally, we provide a list of\nsentiment scores with the often-missing exact p-values and CI for the most\ncommon emoji.", "published": "2018-08-18 18:37:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06110v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Recipe for Arabic-English Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a recipe for building a good Arabic-English neural\nmachine translation. We compare neural systems with traditional phrase-based\nsystems using various parallel corpora including UN, ISI and Ummah. We also\ninvestigate the importance of special preprocessing of the Arabic script. The\npresented results are based on test sets from NIST MT 2005 and 2012. The best\nneural system produces a gain of +13 BLEU points compared to an equivalent\nsimple phrase-based system in NIST MT12 test set. Unexpectedly, we find that\ntuning a model trained on the whole data using a small high quality corpus like\nUmmah gives a substantial improvement (+3 BLEU points). We also find that\ntraining a neural system with a small Arabic-English corpus is competitive to a\ntraditional phrase-based system.", "published": "2018-08-18 19:04:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06116v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Characterizing Transgender Health Issues in Twitter", "abstract": "Although there are millions of transgender people in the world, a lack of\ninformation exists about their health issues. This issue has consequences for\nthe medical field, which only has a nascent understanding of how to identify\nand meet this population's health-related needs. Social media sites like\nTwitter provide new opportunities for transgender people to overcome these\nbarriers by sharing their personal health experiences. Our research employs a\ncomputational framework to collect tweets from self-identified transgender\nusers, detect those that are health-related, and identify their information\nneeds. This framework is significant because it provides a macro-scale\nperspective on an issue that lacks investigation at national or demographic\nlevels. Our findings identified 54 distinct health-related topics that we\ngrouped into 7 broader categories. Further, we found both linguistic and\ntopical differences in the health-related information shared by transgender men\n(TM) as com-pared to transgender women (TW). These findings can help inform\nmedical and policy-based strategies for health interventions within transgender\ncommunities. Also, our proposed approach can inform the development of\ncomputational strategies to identify the health-related information needs of\nother marginalized populations.", "published": "2018-08-18 00:00:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06022v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL", "stat.AP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Robust Speaker Clustering using Mixtures of von Mises-Fisher\n  Distributions for Naturalistic Audio Streams", "abstract": "Speaker Diarization (i.e. determining who spoke and when?) for multi-speaker\nnaturalistic interactions such as Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) sessions is a\nchallenging task. In this study, we propose robust speaker clustering based on\nmixture of multivariate von Mises-Fisher distributions. Our diarization\npipeline has two stages: (i) ground-truth segmentation; (ii) proposed speaker\nclustering. The ground-truth speech activity information is used for extracting\ni-Vectors from each speechsegment. We post-process the i-Vectors with principal\ncomponent analysis for dimension reduction followed by lengthnormalization.\nNormalized i-Vectors are high-dimensional unit vectors possessing\ndiscriminative directional characteristics. We model the normalized i-Vectors\nwith a mixture model consisting of multivariate von Mises-Fisher distributions.\nK-means clustering with cosine distance is chosen as baseline approach. The\nevaluation data is derived from: (i) CRSS-PLTL corpus; and (ii) three-meetings\nsubset of AMI corpus. The CRSSPLTL data contain audio recordings of PLTL\nsessions which is student-led STEM education paradigm. Proposed approach is\nconsistently better than baseline leading to upto 44.48% and 53.68% relative\nimprovements for PLTL and AMI corpus, respectively.
