{"title": "Path Eccentricity and Forbidden Induced Subgraphs", "abstract": "The path eccentricity of a connected graph $G$ is the minimum integer $k$\nsuch that $G$ has a path such that every vertex is at distance at most $k$ from\nthe path. A result of Duffus, Jacobson, and Gould from 1981 states that every\nconnected $\\{\\text{claw}, \\text{net}\\}$-free graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian path,\nthat is, $G$ has path eccentricity~$0$. Several more recent works identified\nvarious classes of connected graphs with path eccentricity at most $1$, or,\nequivalently, graphs having a spanning caterpillar, including connected\n$P_5$-free graphs, AT-free graphs, and biconvex graphs. Generalizing all these\nresults, we apply the work on structural distance domination of Bacs\\'o and\nTuza [Discrete Math., 2012] and characterize, for every positive integer $k$,\ngraphs such that every connected induced subgraph has path eccentricity less\nthan $k$. More specifically, we show that every connected $\\{S_{k},\nT_{k}\\}$-free graph has a path eccentricity less than $k$, where $S_k$ and\n$T_k$ are two specific graphs of path eccentricity $k$ (a subdivided claw and\nthe line graph of such a graph). As a consequence, every connected $H$-free\ngraph has path eccentricity less than $k$ if and only if $H$ is an induced\nsubgraph of $3P_{k}$ or $P_{2k+1} + P_{k-1}$. Our main result also answers an\nopen question of Bastide, Hilaire, and Robinson [Discrete Math., 2025].", "published": "2025-03-19 23:34:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15747v1", "categories": ["math.CO", "cs.DM", "05C12, 05C38", "G.2.2"], "primary_category": "math.CO"}
{"title": "The Fundamental Limits of Recovering Planted Subgraphs", "abstract": "Given an arbitrary subgraph $H=H_n$ and $p=p_n \\in (0,1)$, the planted\nsubgraph model is defined as follows. A statistician observes the union a\nrandom copy $H^*$ of $H$, together with random noise in the form of an instance\nof an Erdos-Renyi graph $G(n,p)$. Their goal is to recover the planted $H^*$\nfrom the observed graph. Our focus in this work is to understand the minimum\nmean squared error (MMSE) for sufficiently large $n$.\n  A recent paper [MNSSZ23] characterizes the graphs for which the limiting MMSE\ncurve undergoes a sharp phase transition from $0$ to $1$ as $p$ increases, a\nbehavior known as the all-or-nothing phenomenon, up to a mild density\nassumption on $H$. In this paper, we provide a formula for the limiting MMSE\ncurve for any graph $H=H_n$, up to the same mild density assumption. This curve\nis expressed in terms of a variational formula over pairs of subgraphs of $H$,\nand is inspired by the celebrated subgraph expectation thresholds from the\nprobabilistic combinatorics literature [KK07]. Furthermore, we give a\npolynomial-time description of the optimizers of this variational problem. This\nallows one to efficiently approximately compute the MMSE curve for any dense\ngraph $H$ when $n$ is large enough. The proof relies on a novel graph\ndecomposition of $H$ as well as a new minimax theorem which may be of\nindependent interest.\n  Our results generalize to the setting of minimax rates of recovering\narbitrary monotone boolean properties planted in random noise, where the\nstatistician observes the union of a planted minimal element $A \\subseteq [N]$\nof a monotone property and a random $Ber(p)^{\\otimes N}$ vector. In this\nsetting, we provide a variational formula inspired by the so-called\n\"fractional\" expectation threshold [Tal10], again describing the MMSE curve (in\nthis case up to a multiplicative constant) for large enough $n$.", "published": "2025-03-19 22:35:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15723v1", "categories": ["math.ST", "cs.DM", "cs.IT", "math.CO", "math.IT", "math.PR", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "math.ST"}

{"title": "Stochastic Volatility Model with Sticky Drawdown and Drawup Processes: A Deep Learning Approach", "abstract": "We propose a new financial model, the stochastic volatility model with sticky\ndrawdown and drawup processes (SVSDU model), which enables us to capture the\nfeatures of winning and losing streaks that are common across financial markets\nbut can not be captured simultaneously by the existing financial models.\nMoreover, the SVSDU model retains the advantages of the stochastic volatility\nmodels. Since there are not closed-form option pricing formulas under the SVSDU\nmodel and the existing simulation methods for the sticky diffusion processes\nare really time-consuming, we develop a deep neural network to solve the\ncorresponding high-dimensional parametric partial differential equation (PDE),\nwhere the solution to the PDE is the pricing function of a European option\naccording to the Feynman-Kac Theorem, and validate the accuracy and efficiency\nof our deep learning approach. We also propose a novel calibration framework\nfor our model, and demonstrate the calibration performances of our models on\nboth simulated data and historical data. The calibration results on SPX option\ndata show that the SVSDU model is a good representation of the asset value\ndynamic, and both winning and losing streaks are accounted for in option\nvalues.
