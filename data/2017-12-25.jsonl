{"title": "Generative Adversarial Nets for Multiple Text Corpora", "abstract": "Generative adversarial nets (GANs) have been successfully applied to the\nartificial generation of image data. In terms of text data, much has been done\non the artificial generation of natural language from a single corpus. We\nconsider multiple text corpora as the input data, for which there can be two\napplications of GANs: (1) the creation of consistent cross-corpus word\nembeddings given different word embeddings per corpus; (2) the generation of\nrobust bag-of-words document embeddings for each corpora. We demonstrate our\nGAN models on real-world text data sets from different corpora, and show that\nembeddings from both models lead to improvements in supervised learning\nproblems.", "published": "2017-12-25 20:16:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09127v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Leveraging Native Language Speech for Accent Identification using Deep\n  Siamese Networks", "abstract": "The problem of automatic accent identification is important for several\napplications like speaker profiling and recognition as well as for improving\nspeech recognition systems. The accented nature of speech can be primarily\nattributed to the influence of the speaker's native language on the given\nspeech recording. In this paper, we propose a novel accent identification\nsystem whose training exploits speech in native languages along with the\naccented speech. Specifically, we develop a deep Siamese network-based model\nwhich learns the association between accented speech recordings and the native\nlanguage speech recordings. The Siamese networks are trained with i-vector\nfeatures extracted from the speech recordings using either an unsupervised\nGaussian mixture model (GMM) or a supervised deep neural network (DNN) model.\nWe perform several accent identification experiments using the CSLU Foreign\nAccented English (FAE) corpus. In these experiments, our proposed approach\nusing deep Siamese networks yield significant relative performance improvements\nof 15.4 percent on a 10-class accent identification task, over a baseline\nDNN-based classification system that uses GMM i-vectors. Furthermore, we\npresent a detailed error analysis of the proposed accent identification system.", "published": "2017-12-25 02:28:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08992v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Overcomplete Frame Thresholding for Acoustic Scene Analysis", "abstract": "In this work, we derive a generic overcomplete frame thresholding scheme\nbased on risk minimization.
