{"title": "An SFP--FCC Method for Pricing and Hedging Early-exercise Options under L\u00e9vy Processes", "abstract": "This paper extends the Singular Fourier--Pad\u00e9 (SFP) method proposed by Chan (2018) to pricing/hedging early-exercise options--Bermudan, American and discrete-monitored barrier options--under a L\u00e9vy process. The current SFP method is incorporated with the Filon--Clenshaw--Curtis (FCC) rules invented by Dom\u00ednguez et al. (2011), and we call the new method SFP--FCC. The main purpose of using the SFP--FCC method is to require a small number of terms to yield fast error convergence and to formulate option pricing and option Greek curves rather than individual prices/Greek values. We also numerically show that the SFP--FCC method can retain a global spectral convergence rate in option pricing and hedging when the risk-free probability density function is piecewise smooth. Moreover, the computational complexity of the method is $\\mathcal{O}((L-1)(N+1)(\\tilde{N} \\log \\tilde{N}) )$ with $N$ a (small) number of complex Fourier series terms, $\\tilde{N}$ a number of Chebyshev series terms and $L$, the number of early-exercise/monitoring dates. Finally, we show that our method is more favourable than existing techniques in numerical experiments.", "published": "2019-09-16 16:26:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07319v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
