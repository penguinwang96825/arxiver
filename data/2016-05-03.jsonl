{"title": "Improving Image Captioning by Concept-based Sentence Reranking", "abstract": "This paper describes our winning entry in the ImageCLEF 2015 image sentence\ngeneration task. We improve Google's CNN-LSTM model by introducing\nconcept-based sentence reranking, a data-driven approach which exploits the\nlarge amounts of concept-level annotations on Flickr. Different from previous\nusage of concept detection that is tailored to specific image captioning\nmodels, the propose approach reranks predicted sentences in terms of their\nmatches with detected concepts, essentially treating the underlying model as a\nblack box. This property makes the approach applicable to a number of existing\nsolutions. We also experiment with fine tuning on the deep language model,\nwhich improves the performance further. Scoring METEOR of 0.1875 on the\nImageCLEF 2015 test set, our system outperforms the runner-up (METEOR of\n0.1687) with a clear margin.", "published": "2016-05-03 12:13:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00855v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "TheanoLM - An Extensible Toolkit for Neural Network Language Modeling", "abstract": "We present a new tool for training neural network language models (NNLMs),\nscoring sentences, and generating text. The tool has been written using Python\nlibrary Theano, which allows researcher to easily extend it and tune any aspect\nof the training process. Regardless of the flexibility, Theano is able to\ngenerate extremely fast native code that can utilize a GPU or multiple CPU\ncores in order to parallelize the heavy numerical computations. The tool has\nbeen evaluated in difficult Finnish and English conversational speech\nrecognition tasks, and significant improvement was obtained over our best\nback-off n-gram models. The results that we obtained in the Finnish task were\ncompared to those from existing RNNLM and RWTHLM toolkits, and found to be as\ngood or better, while training times were an order of magnitude shorter.", "published": "2016-05-03 15:20:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00942v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
