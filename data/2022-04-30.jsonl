{"title": "Receiver Design for MIMO Unsourced Random Access with SKP Coding", "abstract": "In this letter, we extend the sparse Kronecker-product (SKP) coding scheme, originally designed for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) unsourced random access (URA). With the SKP coding adopted for MIMO transmission, we develop an efficient Bayesian iterative receiver design to solve the intended challenging trilinear factorization problem. Numerical results show that the proposed design outperforms the existing counterparts, and that it performs well in all simulated settings with various antenna sizes and active-user numbers.", "published": "2022-04-30 03:08:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00138v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
