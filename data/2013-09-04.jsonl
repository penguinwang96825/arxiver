{"title": "Advances in the Logical Representation of Lexical Semantics", "abstract": "The integration of lexical semantics and pragmatics in the analysis of the\nmeaning of natural lan- guage has prompted changes to the global framework\nderived from Montague. In those works, the original lexicon, in which words\nwere assigned an atomic type of a single-sorted logic, has been re- placed by a\nset of many-facetted lexical items that can compose their meaning with salient\ncontextual properties using a rich typing system as a guide. Having related our\nproposal for such an expanded framework \\LambdaTYn, we present some recent\nadvances in the logical formalisms associated, including constraints on lexical\ntransformations and polymorphic quantifiers, and ongoing discussions and\nresearch on the granularity of the type system and the limits of transitivity.", "published": "2013-09-04 12:56:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1014v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning to answer questions", "abstract": "We present an open-domain Question-Answering system that learns to answer\nquestions based on successful past interactions. We follow a pattern-based\napproach to Answer-Extraction, where (lexico-syntactic) patterns that relate a\nquestion to its answer are automatically learned and used to answer future\nquestions. Results show that our approach contributes to the system's best\nperformance when it is conjugated with typical Answer-Extraction strategies.\nMoreover, it allows the system to learn with the answered questions and to\nrectify wrong or unsolved past questions.", "published": "2013-09-04 18:10:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1125v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Analysing Quality of English-Hindi Machine Translation Engine Outputs\n  Using Bayesian Classification", "abstract": "This paper considers the problem for estimating the quality of machine\ntranslation outputs which are independent of human intervention and are\ngenerally addressed using machine learning techniques.There are various\nmeasures through which a machine learns translations quality. Automatic\nEvaluation metrics produce good co-relation at corpus level but cannot produce\nthe same results at the same segment or sentence level. In this paper 16\nfeatures are extracted from the input sentences and their translations and a\nquality score is obtained based on Bayesian inference produced from training\ndata.", "published": "2013-09-04 18:23:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1129v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
