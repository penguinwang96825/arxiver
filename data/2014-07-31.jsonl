{"title": "Zipf's law for word frequencies: word forms versus lemmas in long texts", "abstract": "Zipf's law is a fundamental paradigm in the statistics of written and spoken\nnatural language as well as in other communication systems. We raise the\nquestion of the elementary units for which Zipf's law should hold in the most\nnatural way, studying its validity for plain word forms and for the\ncorresponding lemma forms. In order to have as homogeneous sources as possible,\nwe analyze some of the longest literary texts ever written, comprising four\ndifferent languages, with different levels of morphological complexity. In all\ncases Zipf's law is fulfilled, in the sense that a power-law distribution of\nword or lemma frequencies is valid for several orders of magnitude. We\ninvestigate the extent to which the word-lemma transformation preserves two\nparameters of Zipf's law: the exponent and the low-frequency cut-off. We are\nnot able to demonstrate a strict invariance of the tail, as for a few texts\nboth exponents deviate significantly, but we conclude that the exponents are\nvery similar, despite the remarkable transformation that going from words to\nlemmas represents, considerably affecting all ranges of frequencies. In\ncontrast, the low-frequency cut-offs are less stable.", "published": "2014-07-31 09:02:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8322v2", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
