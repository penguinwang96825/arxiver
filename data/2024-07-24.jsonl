{"title": "Estimation of bid-ask spreads in the presence of serial dependence", "abstract": "Starting from a basic model in which the dynamic of the transaction prices is\na geometric Brownian motion disrupted by a microstructure white noise,\ncorresponding to the random alternation of bids and asks, we propose\nmoment-based estimators along with their statistical properties. We then make\nthe model more realistic by considering serial dependence: we assume a\ngeometric fractional Brownian motion for the price, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess for the microstructure noise. In these two cases of serial dependence,\nwe propose again consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. All our\nestimators are compared on simulated data with existing approaches, such as\nRoll, Corwin-Schultz, Abdi-Ranaldo, or Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke estimators.", "published": "2024-07-24 16:26:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17401v3", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.TR", "stat.AP", "stat.ME"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
