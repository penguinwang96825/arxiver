{"title": "Generalized signals on simplicial complexes", "abstract": "Topological signal processing (TSP) over simplicial complexes typically assumes observations associated with the simplicial complexes are real scalars. In this paper, we develop TSP theories for the case where observations belong to general abelian groups, including function spaces that are commonly used to represent time-varying signals. Our approach generalizes the Hodge decomposition and allows for signal processing tasks to be performed on these more complex observations. We propose a unified and flexible framework for TSP that expands its applicability to a wider range of signal processing applications. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and provide a foundation for future research in this area.", "published": "2023-05-11 15:39:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06899v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Robust Detection of Lead-Lag Relationships in Lagged Multi-Factor Models", "abstract": "In multivariate time series systems, key insights can be obtained by discovering lead-lag relationships inherent in the data, which refer to the dependence between two time series shifted in time relative to one another, and which can be leveraged for the purposes of control, forecasting or clustering. We develop a clustering-driven methodology for robust detection of lead-lag relationships in lagged multi-factor models. Within our framework, the envisioned pipeline takes as input a set of time series, and creates an enlarged universe of extracted subsequence time series from each input time series, via a sliding window approach. This is then followed by an application of various clustering techniques, (such as k-means++ and spectral clustering), employing a variety of pairwise similarity measures, including nonlinear ones. Once the clusters have been extracted, lead-lag estimates across clusters are robustly aggregated to enhance the identification of the consistent relationships in the original universe. We establish connections to the multireference alignment problem for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Since multivariate time series are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, we demonstrate that our method is not only able to robustly detect lead-lag relationships in financial markets, but can also yield insightful results when applied to an environmental data set.", "published": "2023-05-11 10:30:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06704v3", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
