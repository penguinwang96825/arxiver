{"title": "A stronger null hypothesis for crossing dependencies", "abstract": "The syntactic structure of a sentence can be modeled as a tree where vertices\nare words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies between words. It is\nwell-known that those edges normally do not cross when drawn over the sentence.\nHere a new null hypothesis for the number of edge crossings of a sentence is\npresented. That null hypothesis takes into account the length of the pair of\nedges that may cross and predicts the relative number of crossings in random\ntrees with a small error, suggesting that a ban of crossings or a principle of\nminimization of crossings are not needed in general to explain the origins of\nnon-crossing dependencies. Our work paves the way for more powerful null\nhypotheses to investigate the origins of non-crossing dependencies in nature.", "published": "2014-10-20 22:04:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5485v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Using Mechanical Turk to Build Machine Translation Evaluation Sets", "abstract": "Building machine translation (MT) test sets is a relatively expensive task.\nAs MT becomes increasingly desired for more and more language pairs and more\nand more domains, it becomes necessary to build test sets for each case. In\nthis paper, we investigate using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to make MT\ntest sets cheaply. We find that MTurk can be used to make test sets much\ncheaper than professionally-produced test sets. More importantly, in\nexperiments with multiple MT systems, we find that the MTurk-produced test sets\nyield essentially the same conclusions regarding system performance as the\nprofessionally-produced test sets yield.", "published": "2014-10-20 22:28:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5491v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
