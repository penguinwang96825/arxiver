{"title": "Predicting economic market crises using measures of collective panic", "abstract": "Predicting panic is of critical importance in many areas of human and animal behavior, notably in the context of economics. The recent financial crisis is a case in point. Panic may be due to a specific external threat, or self-generated nervousness. Here we show that the recent economic crisis and earlier large single-day panics were preceded by extended periods of high levels of market mimicry --- direct evidence of uncertainty and nervousness, and of the comparatively weak influence of external news. High levels of mimicry can be a quite general indicator of the potential for self-organized crises.", "published": "2011-02-13 17:50:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2620v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
