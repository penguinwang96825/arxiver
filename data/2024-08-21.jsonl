{"title": "A case study on different one-factor Cheyette models for short maturity caplet calibration", "abstract": "In [1], we calibrated a one-factor Cheyette SLV model with a local volatility\nthat is linear in the benchmark forward rate and an uncorrelated CIR stochastic\nvariance to 3M caplets of various maturities. While caplet smiles for many\nmaturities could be reasonably well calibrated across the range of strikes, for\ninstance the 1Y maturity could not be calibrated well across that entire range\nof strikes. Here, we study whether models with alternative local volatility\nterms and/or alternative stochastic volatility or variance models can calibrate\nthe 1Y caplet smile better across the strike range better than the model\nstudied in [1]. This is made possible and feasible by the generic simulation,\npricing, and calibration frameworks introduced in [1] and some new frameworks\npresented in this paper. We find that some model settings calibrate well to the\n1Y smile across the strike range under study. In particular, a model setting\nwith a local volatility that is piece-wise linear in the benchmark forward rate\ntogether with an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance and one with a local\nvolatility that is linear in the benchmark rate together with a correlated\nlognormal stochastic volatility with quadratic drift (QDLNSV) as in [2]\ncalibrate well. We discuss why the later might be a preferable model.\n  [1] Arun Kumar Polala and Bernhard Hientzsch.

{"title": "Deviations from the Nash equilibrium and emergence of tacit collusion in a two-player optimal execution game with reinforcement learning", "abstract": "The use of reinforcement learning algorithms in financial trading is becoming\nincreasingly prevalent. However, the autonomous nature of these algorithms can\nlead to unexpected outcomes that deviate from traditional game-theoretical\npredictions and may even destabilize markets. In this study, we examine a\nscenario in which two autonomous agents, modeled with Double Deep Q-Learning,\nlearn to liquidate the same asset optimally in the presence of market impact,\nusing the Almgren-Chriss (2000) framework. Our results show that the strategies\nlearned by the agents deviate significantly from the Nash equilibrium of the\ncorresponding market impact game. Notably, the learned strategies exhibit tacit\ncollusion, closely aligning with the Pareto-optimal solution. We further\nexplore how different levels of market volatility influence the agents'\nperformance and the equilibria they discover, including scenarios where\nvolatility differs between the training and testing phases.", "published": "2024-08-21 16:54:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11773v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "econ.GN", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.EC", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Less is more: AI Decision-Making using Dynamic Deep Neural Networks for Short-Term Stock Index Prediction", "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a multi-agent deep-learning method which trades in\nthe Futures markets based on the US S&P 500 index. The method (referred to as\nModel A) is an innovation founded on existing well-established machine-learning\nmodels which sample market prices and associated derivatives in order to decide\nwhether the investment should be long/short or closed (zero exposure), on a\nday-to-day decision. We compare the predictions with some conventional\nmachine-learning methods namely, Long Short-Term Memory, Random Forest and\nGradient-Boosted-Trees. Results are benchmarked against a passive model in\nwhich the Futures contracts are held (long) continuously with the same exposure\n(level of investment). Historical tests are based on daily daytime trading\ncarried out over a period of 6 calendar years (2018-23). We find that Model A\noutperforms the passive investment in key performance metrics, placing it\nwithin the top quartile performance of US Large Cap active fund managers. Model\nA also outperforms the three machine-learning classification comparators over\nthis period. We observe that Model A is extremely efficient (doing less and\ngetting more) with an exposure to the market of only 41.95% compared to the\n100% market exposure of the passive investment, and thus provides increased\nprofitability with reduced risk.", "published": "2024-08-21 16:04:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11740v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.PM", "I.2.1; I.6.4; I.6.5"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "MEV Capture and Decentralization in Execution Tickets", "abstract": "We provide an economic model of Execution Tickets and use it to study the\nability of the Ethereum protocol to capture MEV from block construction. We\ndemonstrate that Execution Tickets extract all MEV when all buyers are\nhomogeneous, risk neutral and face no capital costs. We also show that MEV\ncapture decreases with risk aversion and capital costs. Moreover, when buyers\nare heterogeneous, MEV capture can be especially low and a single dominant\nbuyer can extract much of the MEV. This adverse effect can be partially\nmitigated by the presence of a Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) mechanism,\nwhich gives ET buyers access to a market of specialized builders, but in\npractice centralization vectors still persist. With PBS, ETs are concentrated\namong those with the highest ex-ante MEV extraction ability and lowest cost of\ncapital. We show how it is possible that large investors that are not builders\nbut have substantial advantage in capital cost can come to dominate the ET\nmarket.", "published": "2024-08-21 00:34:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11255v1", "categories": ["cs.GT", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.GT"}
