{"title": "Dynamic graph neural networks for enhanced volatility prediction in financial markets", "abstract": "Volatility forecasting is essential for risk management and decision-making\nin financial markets. Traditional models like Generalized Autoregressive\nConditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) effectively capture volatility\nclustering but often fail to model complex, non-linear interdependencies\nbetween multiple indices. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) to represent global financial markets as dynamic graphs.\nThe Temporal Graph Attention Network (Temporal GAT) combines Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to capture\nthe temporal and structural dynamics of volatility spillovers. By utilizing\ncorrelation-based and volatility spillover indices, the Temporal GAT constructs\ndirected graphs that enhance the accuracy of volatility predictions. Empirical\nresults from a 15-year study of eight major global indices show that the\nTemporal GAT outperforms traditional GARCH models and other machine learning\nmethods, particularly in short- to mid-term forecasts. The sensitivity and\nscenario-based analysis over a range of parameters and hyperparameters further\ndemonstrate the significance of the proposed technique. Hence, this work\nhighlights the potential of GNNs in modeling complex market behaviors,\nproviding valuable insights for financial analysts and investors.", "published": "2024-10-22 09:52:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16858v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "cs.LG", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Optimal consumption under relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint", "abstract": "This paper studies an optimal consumption problem with both relaxed benchmark\ntracking and consumption drawdown constraint, leading to a stochastic control\nproblem with dynamic state-control constraints. In our relaxed tracking\nformulation, it is assumed that the fund manager can strategically inject\ncapital to the fund account such that the total capital process always\noutperforms the benchmark process, which is described by a geometric Brownian\nmotion. We first transform the original regular-singular control problem with\nstate-control constraints into an equivalent regular control problem with a\nreflected state process and consumption drawdown constraint. By utilizing the\ndual transform and the optimal consumption behavior, we then turn to study the\nlinear dual PDE with both Neumann boundary condition and free boundary\ncondition in a piecewise manner across different regions. Using the smoothfit\nprinciple and the super-contact condition, we derive the closed-form solution\nof the dual PDE, and obtain the optimal investment and consumption in feedback\nform. We then prove the verification theorem on optimality by some novel\narguments with the aid of an auxiliary reflected dual process and some\ntechnical estimations. Some numerical examples and financial insights are also\npresented.", "published": "2024-10-22 01:49:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16611v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "Kendall Correlation Coefficients for Portfolio Optimization", "abstract": "Markowitz's optimal portfolio relies on the accurate estimation of\ncorrelations between asset returns, a difficult problem when the number of\nobservations is not much larger than the number of assets. Using powerful\nresults from random matrix theory, several schemes have been developed to\n\"clean\" the eigenvalues of empirical correlation matrices. By contrast, the (in\npractice equally important) problem of correctly estimating the eigenvectors of\nthe correlation matrix has received comparatively little attention. Here we\ndiscuss a class of correlation estimators generalizing Kendall's rank\ncorrelation coefficient which improve the estimation of both eigenvalues and\neigenvectors in data-poor regimes. Using both synthetic and real financial\ndata, we show that these generalized correlation coefficients yield Markowitz\nportfolios with lower out-of-sample risk than those obtained with rotationally\ninvariant estimators. Central to these results is a property shared by all\nKendall-like estimators but not with classical correlation coefficients: zero\neigenvalues only appear when the number of assets becomes proportional to the\nsquare of the number of data points.", "published": "2024-10-22 19:01:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17366v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cond-mat.stat-mech"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
