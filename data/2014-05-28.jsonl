We submitted runs for Bengali, English, Hindi, Marathi,\nPunjabi, Tamil and Telugu. A statistical HMM (Hidden Markov Models) based model\nhas been used to implement our system. The system has been trained and tested\non the NLP TOOLS CONTEST: ICON 2013 datasets. Our system obtains F-measures of\n0.8599, 0.7704, 0.7520, 0.4289, 0.5455, 0.4466, and 0.4003 for Bengali,\nEnglish, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu respectively.", "published": "2014-05-28 21:05:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7397v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
