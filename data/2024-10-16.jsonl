{"title": "Price impact and long-term profitability of energy storage", "abstract": "We study the price impact of storage facilities in electricity markets and\nanalyze the long-term profitability of these facilities in prospective\nscenarios of energy transition. To this end, we begin by characterizing the\noptimal operating strategy for a stylized storage system, assuming an arbitrary\nexogenous price process. Following this, we determine the equilibrium price in\na market comprising storage systems (acting as price takers), renewable energy\nproducers, and conventional producers with a defined supply function, all\ndriven by an exogenous demand process. The price process is characterized as a\nsolution to a fully coupled system of forward-backward stochastic differential\nequations, for which we establish existence and uniqueness under appropriate\nassumptions. We finally illustrate the impact of storage on intraday\nelectricity prices through numerical examples and show how the revenues of\nstorage agents may evolve in prospective energy transition scenarios from RTE,\nthe French energy electricity network operator, taking into account both the\nincreasing penetration of renewable energies and the self-cannibalization\neffect of growing storage capacity. We find that both the average revenues and\nthe interquantile ranges increase in all scenarios, highlighting higher\nexpected profits and higher risk for storage assets.", "published": "2024-10-16 12:16:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12495v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "91A80, 91A06"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "TradExpert: Revolutionizing Trading with Mixture of Expert LLMs", "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the financial domain has\nopened new avenues for quantitative trading, particularly through the use of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). However, the challenge of effectively\nsynthesizing insights from diverse data sources and integrating both structured\nand unstructured data persists. This paper presents TradeExpert, a novel\nframework that employs a mix of experts (MoE) approach, using four specialized\nLLMs, each analyzing distinct sources of financial data, including news\narticles, market data, alpha factors, and fundamental data. The insights of\nthese expert LLMs are further synthesized by a General Expert LLM to make a\nfinal prediction or decision. With specific prompts, TradeExpert can be\nswitched between the prediction mode and the ranking mode for stock movement\nprediction and quantitative stock trading, respectively. In addition to\nexisting benchmarks, we also release a large-scale financial dataset to\ncomprehensively evaluate TradeExpert's effectiveness. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate TradeExpert's superior performance across all trading scenarios.", "published": "2024-10-16 20:24:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00782v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
