{"title": "Coarse-grained Cross-lingual Alignment of Comparable Texts with Topic\n  Models and Encyclopedic Knowledge", "abstract": "We present a method for coarse-grained cross-lingual alignment of comparable\ntexts: segments consisting of contiguous paragraphs that discuss the same theme\n(e.g. history, economy) are aligned based on induced multilingual topics. The\nmethod combines three ideas: a two-level LDA model that filters out words that\ndo not convey themes, an HMM that models the ordering of themes in the\ncollection of documents, and language-independent concept annotations to serve\nas a cross-language bridge and to strengthen the connection between paragraphs\nin the same segment through concept relations. The method is evaluated on\nEnglish and French data previously used for monolingual alignment. The results\nshow state-of-the-art performance in both monolingual and cross-lingual\nsettings.", "published": "2014-11-28 11:33:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7820v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Using Sentence Plausibility to Learn the Semantics of Transitive Verbs", "abstract": "The functional approach to compositional distributional semantics considers\ntransitive verbs to be linear maps that transform the distributional vectors\nrepresenting nouns into a vector representing a sentence. We conduct an initial\ninvestigation that uses a matrix consisting of the parameters of a logistic\nregression classifier trained on a plausibility task as a transitive verb\nfunction. We compare our method to a commonly used corpus-based method for\nconstructing a verb matrix and find that the plausibility training may be more\neffective for disambiguation tasks.", "published": "2014-11-28 16:57:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7942v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
