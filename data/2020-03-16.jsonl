Area coverage with unmanned vehicles is used today in the exploration of an area with UAVs, sweeping mines with robots, cleaning ground with robots in large shopping malls, mowing lawn in a large area etc. The problem has versions such as area coverage with a single unmanned vehicle, area coverage with multiple unmanned vehicles, on-line area coverage (The map of the area that will be covered is not known before starting the coverage) with unmanned vehicles etc. In addition, the area may have obstacles that the vehicles cannot move over. Naturally, many researches are working on the problem and a lot of researches have been done on the problem until today. Spanning tree coverage is one of the major approaches to the problem. In this approach, at the basic level, the planar area is divided into identical squares according to the range of sight of the vehicle, and centers of these squares are assumed to be vertexes of a graph. The vertexes of this graph are connected with the edges with unit costs and after finding the minimum spanning tree of the graph, the vehicle strolls around the spanning tree. The method we propose suggests a way to cover a non-planar area with unmanned vehicles. The method we propose also takes advantage of the spanning-tree coverage approach, but instead of assigning unit costs to the edges, we assigned a weight to each edge using slopes between vertexes those the edges connect. We have gotten noticeably better results than the results we got when we did not consider the slope between two squares and used the classical spanning tree approach.", "published": "2020-03-16 14:07:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09310v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.MA", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Health State Estimation", "abstract": "Life's most valuable asset is health. Continuously understanding the state of our health and modeling how it evolves is essential if we wish to improve it. Given the opportunity that people live with more data about their life today than any other time in history, the challenge rests in interweaving this data with the growing body of knowledge to compute and model the health state of an individual continually. This dissertation presents an approach to build a personal model and dynamically estimate the health state of an individual by fusing multi-modal data and domain knowledge. The system is stitched together from four essential abstraction elements: 1. the events in our life, 2. the layers of our biological systems (from molecular to an organism), 3. the functional utilities that arise from biological underpinnings, and 4. how we interact with these utilities in the reality of daily life. Connecting these four elements via graph network blocks forms the backbone by which we instantiate a digital twin of an individual. Edges and nodes in this graph structure are then regularly updated with learning techniques as data is continuously digested. Experiments demonstrate the use of dense and heterogeneous real-world data from a variety of personal and environmental sensors to monitor individual cardiovascular health state. State estimation and individual modeling is the fundamental basis to depart from disease-oriented approaches to a total health continuum paradigm. Precision in predicting health requires understanding state trajectory. By encasing this estimation within a navigational approach, a systematic guidance framework can plan actions to transition a current state towards a desired one. This work concludes by presenting this framework of combining the health state and personal graph model to perpetually plan and assist us in living life towards our goals.", "published": "2020-03-16 21:06:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09312v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CY", "cs.HC", "q-bio.QM"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

We present a Next Location Predictor with Markov Modeling (NLPMM) which has the following advantages: (1) it considers both individual and collective movement patterns in making prediction, (2) it is effective even when the trajectory data is sparse, (3) it considers the time factor and builds models that are suited to different time periods. We have conducted extensive experiments in a real dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of NLPMM over existing methods.", "published": "2020-03-16 05:48:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07037v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Solving Area Coverage Problem with UAVs: A Vehicle Routing with Time Windows Variation", "abstract": "In real life, providing security for a set of large areas by covering the area with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a difficult problem that consist of multiple objectives. These difficulties are even greater if the area coverage must continue throughout a specific time window. We address this by considering a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) variation in which capacity of agents is one and each customer (target area) must be supplied with more than one vehicles simultaneously without violating time windows. In this problem, our aim is to find a way to cover all areas with the necessary number of UAVs during the time windows, minimize the total distance traveled, and provide a fast solution by satisfying the additional constraint that each agent has limited fuel. We present a novel algorithm that relies on clustering the target areas according to their time windows, and then incrementally generating transportation problems with each cluster and the ready UAVs. Then we solve transportation problems with the simplex algorithm to generate the solution. The performance of the proposed algorithm and other implemented algorithms to compare the solution quality is evaluated on example scenarios with practical problem sizes.", "published": "2020-03-16 11:27:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07124v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Uncertainty Quantification for Demand Prediction in Contextual Dynamic Pricing", "abstract": "Data-driven sequential decision has found a wide range of applications in modern operations management, such as dynamic pricing, inventory control, and assortment optimization. Most existing research on data-driven sequential decision focuses on designing an online policy to maximize the revenue. However, the research on uncertainty quantification on the underlying true model function (e.g., demand function), a critical problem for practitioners, has not been well explored. In this paper, using the problem of demand function prediction in dynamic pricing as the motivating example, we study the problem of constructing accurate confidence intervals for the demand function. The main challenge is that sequentially collected data leads to significant distributional bias in the maximum likelihood estimator or the empirical risk minimization estimate, making classical statistics approaches such as the Wald's test no longer valid. We address this challenge by developing a debiased approach and provide the asymptotic normality guarantee of the debiased estimator. Based this the debiased estimator, we provide both point-wise and uniform confidence intervals of the demand function.", "published": "2020-03-16 04:21:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07017v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Multi-modal Multi-channel Target Speech Separation", "abstract": "Target speech separation refers to extracting a target speaker's voice from an overlapped audio of simultaneous talkers. Previously the use of visual modality for target speech separation has demonstrated great potentials. This work proposes a general multi-modal framework for target speech separation by utilizing all the available information of the target speaker, including his/her spatial location, voice characteristics and lip movements. Also, under this framework, we investigate on the fusion methods for multi-modal joint modeling. A factorized attention-based fusion method is proposed to aggregate the high-level semantic information of multi-modalities at embedding level. This method firstly factorizes the mixture audio into a set of acoustic subspaces, then leverages the target's information from other modalities to enhance these subspace acoustic embeddings with a learnable attention scheme. To validate the robustness of proposed multi-modal separation model in practical scenarios, the system was evaluated under the condition that one of the modalities is temporarily missing, invalid or corrupted. Experiments are conducted on a large-scale audio-visual dataset collected from YouTube (to be released) that spatialized by simulated room impulse responses (RIRs). Experiment results illustrate that our proposed multi-modal framework significantly outperforms single-modal and bi-modal speech separation approaches, while can still support real-time processing.", "published": "2020-03-16 05:33:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07032v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD", "eess.IV"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "A Generative Learning Approach for Spatio-temporal Modeling in Connected Vehicular Network", "abstract": "Spatio-temporal modeling of wireless access latency is of great importance for connected-vehicular systems. The quality of the molded results rely heavily on the number and quality of samples which can vary significantly due to the sensor deployment density as well as traffic volume and density. This paper proposes LaMI (Latency Model Inpainting), a novel framework to generate a comprehensive spatio-temporal of wireless access latency of a connected vehicles across a wide geographical area. LaMI adopts the idea from image inpainting and synthesizing and can reconstruct the missing latency samples by a two-step procedure. In particular, it first discovers the spatial correlation between samples collected in various regions using a patching-based approach and then feeds the original and highly correlated samples into a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a deep generative model, to create latency samples with similar probability distribution with the original samples. Finally, LaMI establishes the empirical PDF of latency performance and maps the PDFs into the confidence levels of different vehicular service requirements. Extensive performance evaluation has been conducted using the real traces collected in a commercial LTE network in a university campus. Simulation results show that our proposed model can significantly improve the accuracy of latency modeling especially compared to existing popular solutions such as interpolation and nearest neighbor-based methods.", "published": "2020-03-16 03:43:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07004v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
