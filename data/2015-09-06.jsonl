{"title": "A Hybrid Approach to Domain-Specific Entity Linking", "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art Entity Linking (EL) systems are geared towards\ncorpora that are as heterogeneous as the Web, and therefore perform\nsub-optimally on domain-specific corpora. A key open problem is how to\nconstruct effective EL systems for specific domains, as knowledge of the local\ncontext should in principle increase, rather than decrease, effectiveness. In\nthis paper we propose the hybrid use of simple specialist linkers in\ncombination with an existing generalist system to address this problem. Our\nmain findings are the following. First, we construct a new reusable benchmark\nfor EL on a corpus of domain-specific conversations. Second, we test the\nperformance of a range of approaches under the same conditions, and show that\nspecialist linkers obtain high precision in isolation, and high recall when\ncombined with generalist linkers. Hence, we can effectively exploit local\ncontext and get the best of both worlds.", "published": "2015-09-06 23:16:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01865v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "H.3.1"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Sampled Weighted Min-Hashing for Large-Scale Topic Mining", "abstract": "We present Sampled Weighted Min-Hashing (SWMH), a randomized approach to\nautomatically mine topics from large-scale corpora. SWMH generates multiple\nrandom partitions of the corpus vocabulary based on term co-occurrence and\nagglomerates highly overlapping inter-partition cells to produce the mined\ntopics. While other approaches define a topic as a probabilistic distribution\nover a vocabulary, SWMH topics are ordered subsets of such vocabulary.\nInterestingly, the topics mined by SWMH underlie themes from the corpus at\ndifferent levels of granularity. We extensively evaluate the meaningfulness of\nthe mined topics both qualitatively and quantitatively on the NIPS (1.7 K\ndocuments), 20 Newsgroups (20 K), Reuters (800 K) and Wikipedia (4 M) corpora.\nAdditionally, we compare the quality of SWMH with Online LDA topics for\ndocument representation in classification.", "published": "2015-09-06 06:09:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01771v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
