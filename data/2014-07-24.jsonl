{"title": "Feature Engineering for Knowledge Base Construction", "abstract": "Knowledge base construction (KBC) is the process of populating a knowledge\nbase, i.e., a relational database together with inference rules, with\ninformation extracted from documents and structured sources. KBC blurs the\ndistinction between two traditional database problems, information extraction\nand information integration. For the last several years, our group has been\nbuilding knowledge bases with scientific collaborators. Using our approach, we\nhave built knowledge bases that have comparable and sometimes better quality\nthan those constructed by human volunteers. In contrast to these knowledge\nbases, which took experts a decade or more human years to construct, many of\nour projects are constructed by a single graduate student.\n  Our approach to KBC is based on joint probabilistic inference and learning,\nbut we do not see inference as either a panacea or a magic bullet: inference is\na tool that allows us to be systematic in how we construct, debug, and improve\nthe quality of such systems. In addition, inference allows us to construct\nthese systems in a more loosely coupled way than traditional approaches. To\nsupport this idea, we have built the DeepDive system, which has the design goal\nof letting the user \"think about features---not algorithms.\" We think of\nDeepDive as declarative in that one specifies what they want but not how to get\nit. We describe our approach with a focus on feature engineering, which we\nargue is an understudied problem relative to its importance to end-to-end\nquality.", "published": "2014-07-24 03:34:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6439v3", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DB"}
