{"title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects", "abstract": "Deep learning mechanisms are prevailing approaches in recent days for the\nvarious tasks in natural language processing, speech recognition, image\nprocessing and many others. To leverage this we use deep learning based\nmechanism specifically Bidirectional- Long Short-Term Memory (B-LSTM) for the\ntask of dialectic identification in Arabic and German broadcast speech and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) for discriminating between similar Languages. Two\nunique B-LSTM models are created using the Large-vocabulary Continuous Speech\nRecognition (LVCSR) based lexical features and a fixed length of 400 per\nutterance bottleneck features generated by i-vector framework. These models\nwere evaluated on the VarDial 2017 datasets for the tasks Arabic, German\ndialect identification with dialects of Egyptian, Gulf, Levantine, North\nAfrican, and MSA for Arabic and Basel, Bern, Lucerne, and Zurich for German.\nAlso for the task of Discriminating between Similar Languages like Bosnian,\nCroatian and Serbian. The B-LSTM model showed accuracy of 0.246 on lexical\nfeatures and accuracy of 0.577 bottleneck features of i-Vector framework.", "published": "2019-01-02 08:47:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00297v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Judge the Judges: A Large-Scale Evaluation Study of Neural Language\n  Models for Online Review Generation", "abstract": "We conduct a large-scale, systematic study to evaluate the existing\nevaluation methods for natural language generation in the context of generating\nonline product reviews. We compare human-based evaluators with a variety of\nautomated evaluation procedures, including discriminative evaluators that\nmeasure how well machine-generated text can be distinguished from human-written\ntext, as well as word overlap metrics that assess how similar the generated\ntext compares to human-written references. We determine to what extent these\ndifferent evaluators agree on the ranking of a dozen of state-of-the-art\ngenerators for online product reviews. We find that human evaluators do not\ncorrelate well with discriminative evaluators, leaving a bigger question of\nwhether adversarial accuracy is the correct objective for natural language\ngeneration. In general, distinguishing machine-generated text is challenging\neven for human evaluators, and human decisions correlate better with lexical\noverlaps. We find lexical diversity an intriguing metric that is indicative of\nthe assessments of different evaluators. A post-experiment survey of\nparticipants provides insights into how to evaluate and improve the quality of\nnatural language generation systems.", "published": "2019-01-02 14:45:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00398v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
