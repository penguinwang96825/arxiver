{"title": "Automatic Labelling of Topics with Neural Embeddings", "abstract": "Topics generated by topic models are typically represented as list of terms.\nTo reduce the cognitive overhead of interpreting these topics for end-users, we\npropose labelling a topic with a succinct phrase that summarises its theme or\nidea. Using Wikipedia document titles as label candidates, we compute neural\nembeddings for documents and words to select the most relevant labels for\ntopics. Compared to a state-of-the-art topic labelling system, our methodology\nis simpler, more efficient, and finds better topic labels.", "published": "2016-12-16 02:49:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05340v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Two-Phase Approach Towards Identifying Argument Structure in Natural\n  Language", "abstract": "We propose a new approach for extracting argument structure from natural\nlanguage texts that contain an underlying argument. Our approach comprises of\ntwo phases: Score Assignment and Structure Prediction. The Score Assignment\nphase trains models to classify relations between argument units (Support,\nAttack or Neutral). To that end, different training strategies have been\nexplored. We identify different linguistic and lexical features for training\nthe classifiers. Through ablation study, we observe that our novel use of\nword-embedding features is most effective for this task. The Structure\nPrediction phase makes use of the scores from the Score Assignment phase to\narrive at the optimal structure. We perform experiments on three argumentation\ndatasets, namely, AraucariaDB, Debatepedia and Wikipedia. We also propose two\nbaselines and observe that the proposed approach outperforms baseline systems\nfor the final task of Structure Prediction.", "published": "2016-12-16 10:39:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05420v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Machine Reading with Background Knowledge", "abstract": "Intelligent systems capable of automatically understanding natural language\ntext are important for many artificial intelligence applications including\nmobile phone voice assistants, computer vision, and robotics. Understanding\nlanguage often constitutes fitting new information into a previously acquired\nview of the world. However, many machine reading systems rely on the text alone\nto infer its meaning. In this paper, we pursue a different approach; machine\nreading methods that make use of background knowledge to facilitate language\nunderstanding. To this end, we have developed two methods: The first method\naddresses prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity. It uses background\nknowledge within a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that learns from\nboth labeled and unlabeled data. This approach yields state-of-the-art results\non two datasets against strong baselines; The second method extracts\nrelationships from compound nouns. Our knowledge-aware method for compound noun\nanalysis accurately extracts relationships and significantly outperforms a\nbaseline that does not make use of background knowledge.", "published": "2016-12-16 03:33:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05348v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
