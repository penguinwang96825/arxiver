{"title": "Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models", "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful\nalternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering\nefficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.", "published": "2025-08-01 17:56:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

In the context of complex, nonlinear\nfinite element modeling environments, this can become computationally\nchallenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to\nbalance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand\nassociated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the\nlow-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased\nestimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a\nmulti-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is\nthen computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale\nhigh-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates\nthat the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves\nfor nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational\nsavings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.", "published": "2025-08-01 16:04:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00734v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

However, most existing GDA methods rely\non the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world\nscenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely\nimpairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain\nshifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy.", "published": "2025-08-01 15:32:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00716v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

The\npresent contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of\ntraditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of\nlinking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve\nsuch a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i)\ncomparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a\nsuitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative)\nedge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of\nconcordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an\ninformation-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation\nof Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time\nseries that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while\nrandomising everything else.

Accurate channel\nestimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity\nincreases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a\nsignificant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations\nand require frequent updates.
