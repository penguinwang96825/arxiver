{"title": "Beyond Fixed: Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models", "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful\nalternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering\nefficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.", "published": "2025-08-01 17:56:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

To address these challenges, we introduce an\nadaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize\nhigh-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon\ndecision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward\nPilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by\nprogressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to\nfollow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.\nSubsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of\ngenerated plans.

{"title": "Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English", "abstract": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use.
