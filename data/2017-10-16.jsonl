{"title": "Semi-Supervised Approach to Monitoring Clinical Depressive Symptoms in\n  Social Media", "abstract": "With the rise of social media, millions of people are routinely expressing\ntheir moods, feelings, and daily struggles with mental health issues on social\nmedia platforms like Twitter. Unlike traditional observational cohort studies\nconducted through questionnaires and self-reported surveys, we explore the\nreliable detection of clinical depression from tweets obtained unobtrusively.\nBased on the analysis of tweets crawled from users with self-reported\ndepressive symptoms in their Twitter profiles, we demonstrate the potential for\ndetecting clinical depression symptoms which emulate the PHQ-9 questionnaire\nclinicians use today. Our study uses a semi-supervised statistical model to\nevaluate how the duration of these symptoms and their expression on Twitter (in\nterms of word usage patterns and topical preferences) align with the medical\nfindings reported via the PHQ-9. Our proactive and automatic screening tool is\nable to identify clinical depressive symptoms with an accuracy of 68% and\nprecision of 72%.", "published": "2017-10-16 00:52:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05429v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

In this paper,\nwe present our work on building BKTreebank, a dependency treebank for\nVietnamese.

{"title": "Aligning Script Events with Narrative Texts", "abstract": "Script knowledge plays a central role in text understanding and is relevant\nfor a variety of downstream tasks. In this paper, we consider two recent\ndatasets which provide a rich and general representation of script events in\nterms of paraphrase sets. We introduce the task of mapping event mentions in\nnarrative texts to such script event types, and present a model for this task\nthat exploits rich linguistic representations as well as information on\ntemporal ordering. The results of our experiments demonstrate that this complex\ntask is indeed feasible.", "published": "2017-10-16 14:11:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05709v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification on Business\n  Reviews", "abstract": "Recently Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models have proven remarkable\nresults for text classification and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we\npresent our approach on the task of classifying business reviews using word\nembeddings on a large-scale dataset provided by Yelp: Yelp 2017 challenge\ndataset. We compare word-based CNN using several pre-trained word embeddings\nand end-to-end vector representations for text reviews classification. We\nconduct several experiments to capture the semantic relationship between\nbusiness reviews and we use deep learning techniques that prove that the\nobtained results are competitive with traditional methods.", "published": "2017-10-16 20:03:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05978v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A retrieval-based dialogue system utilizing utterance and context\n  embeddings", "abstract": "Finding semantically rich and computer-understandable representations for\ntextual dialogues, utterances and words is crucial for dialogue systems (or\nconversational agents), as their performance mostly depends on understanding\nthe context of conversations. Recent research aims at finding distributed\nvector representations (embeddings) for words, such that semantically similar\nwords are relatively close within the vector-space. Encoding the \"meaning\" of\ntext into vectors is a current trend, and text can range from words, phrases\nand documents to actual human-to-human conversations. In recent research\napproaches, responses have been generated utilizing a decoder architecture,\ngiven the vector representation of the current conversation. In this paper, the\nutilization of embeddings for answer retrieval is explored by using\nLocality-Sensitive Hashing Forest (LSH Forest), an Approximate Nearest Neighbor\n(ANN) model, to find similar conversations in a corpus and rank possible\ncandidates. Experimental results on the well-known Ubuntu Corpus (in English)\nand a customer service chat dataset (in Dutch) show that, in combination with a\ncandidate selection method, retrieval-based approaches outperform generative\nones and reveal promising future research directions towards the usability of\nsuch a system.", "published": "2017-10-16 15:23:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05780v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
