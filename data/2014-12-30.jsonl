{"title": "From Logical to Distributional Models", "abstract": "The paper relates two variants of semantic models for natural language,\nlogical functional models and compositional distributional vector space models,\nby transferring the logic and reasoning from the logical to the distributional\nmodels.\n  The geometrical operations of quantum logic are reformulated as algebraic\noperations on vectors. A map from functional models to vector space models\nmakes it possible to compare the meaning of sentences word by word.", "published": "2014-12-30 01:43:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8527v1", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.CL", "quant-ph", "F.4.0; F.4.1"], "primary_category": "cs.LO"}
