{"title": "When G^2 is a Konig-Egervary graph?", "abstract": "The square of a graph G is the graph G^2 with the same vertex set as in G, and an edge of G^2 is joining two distinct vertices, whenever the distance between them in G is at most 2. G is a square-stable graph if it enjoys the property alpha(G)=alpha(G^2), where alpha(G) is the size of a maximum stable set in G. In this paper we show that G^2 is a Konig-Egervary graph if and only if G is a square-stable Konig-Egervary graph.", "published": "2010-04-27 13:44:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.4804v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
