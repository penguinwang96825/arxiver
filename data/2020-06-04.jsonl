{"title": "The Requirement Gatherers' Approach to the 2019 Multi-Agent Programming Contest Scenario", "abstract": "The 2019 Multi-Agent Programming Contest (MAPC) scenario poses many challenges for agents participating in the contest. We discuss The Requirement Gatherers' (TRG) approach to handling the various challenges we faced -- including how we designed our system, how we went about debugging our agents, and the strategy we employed to each of our agents. We conclude the paper with remarks about the performance of our agents, and what we should have done differently.", "published": "2020-06-04 12:23:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02816v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
