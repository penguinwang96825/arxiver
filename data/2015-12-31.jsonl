{"title": "Write a Classifier: Predicting Visual Classifiers from Unstructured Text", "abstract": "People typically learn through exposure to visual concepts associated with\nlinguistic descriptions. For instance, teaching visual object categories to\nchildren is often accompanied by descriptions in text or speech. In a machine\nlearning context, these observations motivates us to ask whether this learning\nprocess could be computationally modeled to learn visual classifiers. More\nspecifically, the main question of this work is how to utilize purely textual\ndescription of visual classes with no training images, to learn explicit visual\nclassifiers for them. We propose and investigate two baseline formulations,\nbased on regression and domain transfer, that predict a linear classifier.\nThen, we propose a new constrained optimization formulation that combines a\nregression function and a knowledge transfer function with additional\nconstraints to predict the parameters of a linear classifier. We also propose a\ngeneric kernelized models where a kernel classifier is predicted in the form\ndefined by the representer theorem. The kernelized models allow defining and\nutilizing any two RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space) kernel functions in\nthe visual space and text space, respectively. We finally propose a kernel\nfunction between unstructured text descriptions that builds on distributional\nsemantics, which shows an advantage in our setting and could be useful for\nother applications. We applied all the studied models to predict visual\nclassifiers on two fine-grained and challenging categorization datasets (CU\nBirds and Flower Datasets), and the results indicate successful predictions of\nour final model over several baselines that we designed.", "published": "2015-12-31 22:23:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00025v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
