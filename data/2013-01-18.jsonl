{"title": "Language learning from positive evidence, reconsidered: A\n  simplicity-based approach", "abstract": "Children learn their native language by exposure to their linguistic and\ncommunicative environment, but apparently without requiring that their mistakes\nare corrected. Such learning from positive evidence has been viewed as raising\nlogical problems for language acquisition. In particular, without correction,\nhow is the child to recover from conjecturing an over-general grammar, which\nwill be consistent with any sentence that the child hears? There have been many\nproposals concerning how this logical problem can be dissolved. Here, we review\nrecent formal results showing that the learner has sufficient data to learn\nsuccessfully from positive evidence, if it favours the simplest encoding of the\nlinguistic input. Results include the ability to learn a linguistic prediction,\ngrammaticality judgements, language production, and form-meaning mappings. The\nsimplicity approach can also be scaled-down to analyse the ability to learn a\nspecific linguistic constructions, and is amenable to empirical test as a\nframework for describing human language acquisition.", "published": "2013-01-18 16:53:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4432v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
