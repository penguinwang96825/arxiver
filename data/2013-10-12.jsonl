{"title": "Visualizing Bags of Vectors", "abstract": "The motivation of this work is two-fold - a) to compare between two different\nmodes of visualizing data that exists in a bag of vectors format b) to propose\na theoretical model that supports a new mode of visualizing data. Visualizing\nhigh dimensional data can be achieved using Minimum Volume Embedding, but the\ndata has to exist in a format suitable for computing similarities while\npreserving local distances. This paper compares the visualization between two\nmethods of representing data and also proposes a new method providing sample\nvisualizations for that method.", "published": "2013-10-12 03:48:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3333v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
