{"title": "Loss-Versus-Fair: Efficiency of Dutch Auctions on Blockchains", "abstract": "Milionis et al.(2023) studied the rate at which automated market makers leak\nvalue to arbitrageurs when block times are discrete and follow a Poisson\nprocess, and where the risky asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion.\nWe extend their model to analyze another popular mechanism in decentralized\nfinance for onchain trading: Dutch auctions. We compute the expected losses\nthat a seller incurs to arbitrageurs and expected time-to-fill for Dutch\nauctions as a function of starting price, volatility, decay rate, and average\ninterblock time. We also extend the analysis to gradual Dutch auctions, a\nvariation on Dutch auctions for selling tokens over time at a continuous rate.\nWe use these models to explore the tradeoff between speed of execution and\nquality of execution, which could help inform practitioners in setting\nparameters for starting price and decay rate on Dutch auctions, or help\nplatform designers determine performance parameters like block times.", "published": "2024-05-31 18:04:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00113v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
