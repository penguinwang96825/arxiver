{"title": "Reconstructing Native Language Typology from Foreign Language Usage", "abstract": "Linguists and psychologists have long been studying cross-linguistic\ntransfer, the influence of native language properties on linguistic performance\nin a foreign language. In this work we provide empirical evidence for this\nprocess in the form of a strong correlation between language similarities\nderived from structural features in English as Second Language (ESL) texts and\nequivalent similarities obtained from the typological features of the native\nlanguages. We leverage this finding to recover native language typological\nsimilarity structure directly from ESL text, and perform prediction of\ntypological features in an unsupervised fashion with respect to the target\nlanguages. Our method achieves 72.2% accuracy on the typology prediction task,\na result that is highly competitive with equivalent methods that rely on\ntypological resources.", "published": "2014-04-25 04:10:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6312v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
