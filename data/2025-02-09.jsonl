{"title": "Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) Problems", "abstract": "The Ramsey problem R(3, k) seeks to determine the smallest value of n such\nthat any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on n vertices must either\ncontain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size k. Despite its\nsignificance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey R(3, k)\nproblem such as R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) lack formal verification. To address this\nissue, we use the software MATHCHECK to generate certificates for Ramsey\nproblems R(3, 8) and R(3, 9) (and symmetrically R(8, 3) and R(9, 3)) by\nintegrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra\nsystem (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional\nSAT-only methods, demonstrating a significant improvement in runtime. For\ninstance, our SAT+CAS approach solves R(8, 3) sequentially in 18.5 hours, while\na SAT-only approach using the state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7\ndays. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problem like\nR(9, 3) we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized\ncube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently\nverifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and\ncompleteness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.", "published": "2025-02-09 22:24:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.SC", "math.GR"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Amnesiac Flooding: Easy to break, hard to escape", "abstract": "Broadcast is a central problem in distributed computing. Recently, Hussak and\nTrehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac\nFlooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal\ntime (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i)\nAre there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable\nproperties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with\nrespect to \\emph{faults}?\n  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable\nrestriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free\nsynchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \\emph{only} strictly\nstateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We\nidentify four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that\nAmnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor\nrelaxations of \\textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of\nother terminating broadcast protocols.\n  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating\nor non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on\na single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the\nset of all \\textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the\nnetwork, and obtain a \\textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations,\nstarting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.\n  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents\ncapable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on\narbitrary networks.", "published": "2025-02-09 19:17:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06001v1", "categories": ["cs.DC", "cs.DM", "cs.DS", "68W15, 68W40, 05C85, 68Q25", "F.2.0; G.2.2; C.2.2; C.2.4"], "primary_category": "cs.DC"}
{"title": "Polynomial Regret Concentration of UCB for Non-Deterministic State Transitions", "abstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven effective in solving\ndecision-making problems in perfect information settings. However, its\napplication to stochastic and imperfect information domains remains limited.\nThis paper extends the theoretical framework of MCTS to stochastic domains by\naddressing non-deterministic state transitions, where actions lead to\nprobabilistic outcomes. Specifically, building on the work of Shah et al.\n(2020), we derive polynomial regret concentration bounds for the Upper\nConfidence Bound algorithm in multi-armed bandit problems with stochastic\ntransitions, offering improved theoretical guarantees. Our primary contribution\nis proving that these bounds also apply to non-deterministic environments,\nensuring robust performance in stochastic settings.
