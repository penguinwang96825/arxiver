{"title": "De Finetti's problem with fixed transaction costs and regime switching", "abstract": "In this paper, we examine a modified version of de Finetti's optimal dividend\nproblem, incorporating fixed transaction costs and altering the surplus process\nby introducing two-valued drift and two-valued volatility coefficients. This\nmodification aims to capture the transitions or adjustments in the company's\nfinancial status. We identify the optimal dividend strategy, which maximizes\nthe expected total net dividend payments (after accounting for transaction\ncosts) until ruin, as a two-barrier impulsive dividend strategy. Notably, the\noptimal strategy can be explicitly determined for almost all scenarios\ninvolving different drifts and volatility coefficients. Our primary focus is on\nexploring how changes in drift and volatility coefficients influence the\noptimal dividend strategy.", "published": "2025-02-09 10:21:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05839v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
