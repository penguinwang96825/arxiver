From the weight perspective, we\ndynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old\nknowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a\nweight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,\nwe develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current\nnon-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the\nsemantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has\nlargely been ignored by previous methods.

Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation.

We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail\nReconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the\nmatched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable\nconvolution techniques.", "published": "2025-08-05 11:36:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03338v1", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent.

Both datasets are curated\nthrough a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative\nrefinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight\nVLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand\nsatellite imagery.

Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo).

Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring\nsystem relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach\nsignificantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of\nour CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the\nnumber of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the\nuntrusted transmission link.", "published": "2025-08-05 13:11:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03423v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Are All Genders Equal in the Eyes of Algorithms? -- Analysing Search and Retrieval Algorithms for Algorithmic Gender Fairness", "abstract": "Algorithmic systems such as search engines and information retrieval\nplatforms significantly influence academic visibility and the dissemination of\nknowledge. Despite assumptions of neutrality, these systems can reproduce or\nreinforce societal biases, including those related to gender. This paper\nintroduces and applies a bias-preserving definition of algorithmic gender\nfairness, which assesses whether algorithmic outputs reflect real-world gender\ndistributions without introducing or amplifying disparities. Using a\nheterogeneous dataset of academic profiles from German universities and\nuniversities of applied sciences, we analyse gender differences in metadata\ncompleteness, publication retrieval in academic databases, and visibility in\nGoogle search results. While we observe no overt algorithmic discrimination,\nour findings reveal subtle but consistent imbalances: male professors are\nassociated with a greater number of search results and more aligned publication\nrecords, while female professors display higher variability in digital\nvisibility. These patterns reflect the interplay between platform algorithms,\ninstitutional curation, and individual self-presentation. Our study highlights\nthe need for fairness evaluations that account for both technical performance\nand representational equality in digital systems.", "published": "2025-08-05 15:33:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05680v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning and Prompt-Based Learning: A Comparative Study for developing Natural Language-Based BIM Information Retrieval Systems", "abstract": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for managing building data\nacross the entire lifecycle, supporting tasks from design to maintenance.\nNatural Language Interface (NLI) systems are increasingly explored as\nuser-friendly tools for information retrieval in Building Information Modeling\n(BIM) environments. Despite their potential, accurately extracting BIM-related\ndata through natural language queries remains a persistent challenge due to the\ncomplexity use queries and specificity of domain knowledge. This study presents\na comparative analysis of two prominent approaches for developing NLI-based BIM\ninformation retrieval systems: domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based\nlearning using large language models (LLMs). A two-stage framework consisting\nof intent recognition and table-based question answering is implemented to\nevaluate the effectiveness of both approaches. To support this evaluation, a\nBIM-specific dataset of 1,740 annotated queries of varying types across 69\nmodels is constructed. Experimental results show that domain-specific\nfine-tuning delivers superior performance in intent recognition tasks, while\nprompt-based learning, particularly with GPT-4o, shows strength in table-based\nquestion answering. Based on these findings, this study identify a hybrid\nconfiguration that combines fine-tuning for intent recognition with\nprompt-based learning for question answering, achieving more balanced and\nrobust performance across tasks. This integrated approach is further tested\nthrough case studies involving BIM models of varying complexity. This study\nprovides a systematic analysis of the strengths and limitations of each\napproach and discusses the applicability of the NLI to real-world BIM\nscenarios. The findings offer insights for researchers and practitioners in\ndesigning intelligent, language-driven BIM systems.", "published": "2025-08-05 08:51:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05676v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "LLMDistill4Ads: Using Cross-Encoders to Distill from LLM Signals for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendations at eBay", "abstract": "Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the\nperformance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases\nis crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items\nand maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase\nrecommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.\nDue to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing\nLLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in\nseveral studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation\nprocess from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)\nmodel from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM\nteacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a\nmulti-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to\nretrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge\ndistillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances\nbi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.", "published": "2025-08-05 16:47:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Asymptotic universal moment matching properties of normal distributions", "abstract": "Moment matching is an easy-to-implement and usually effective method to\nreduce variance of Monte Carlo simulation estimates. On the other hand, there\nis no guarantee that moment matching will always reduce simulation variance for\ngeneral integration problems at least asymptotically, i.e. when the number of\nsamples is large. We study the characterization of conditions on a given\nunderlying distribution $X$ under which asymptotic variance reduction is\nguaranteed for a general integration problem $\\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ when moment\nmatching techniques are applied. We show that a sufficient and necessary\ncondition for such asymptotic variance reduction property is $X$ being a normal\ndistribution. Moreover, when $X$ is a normal distribution, formulae for\nefficient estimation of simulation variance for (first and second order) moment\nmatching Monte Carlo are obtained. These formulae allow estimations of\nsimulation variance as by-products of the simulation process, in a way similar\nto variance estimations for plain Monte Carlo. Moreover, we propose non-linear\nmoment matching schemes for any given continuous distribution such that\nasymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed.", "published": "2025-08-05 17:22:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03790v2", "categories": ["math.ST", "math.PR", "q-fin.CP", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "math.ST"}
