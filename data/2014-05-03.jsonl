{"title": "Extracting Family Relationship Networks from Novels", "abstract": "We present an approach to the extraction of family relations from literary\nnarrative, which incorporates a technique for utterance attribution proposed\nrecently by Elson and McKeown (2010). In our work this technique is used in\ncombination with the detection of vocatives - the explicit forms of address\nused by the characters in a novel. We take advantage of the fact that certain\nvocatives indicate family relations between speakers. The extracted relations\nare then propagated using a set of rules. We report the results of the\napplication of our method to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.", "published": "2014-05-03 16:07:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0603v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Kaggle LSHTC4 Winning Solution", "abstract": "Our winning submission to the 2014 Kaggle competition for Large Scale\nHierarchical Text Classification (LSHTC) consists mostly of an ensemble of\nsparse generative models extending Multinomial Naive Bayes. The\nbase-classifiers consist of hierarchically smoothed models combining document,\nlabel, and hierarchy level Multinomials, with feature pre-processing using\nvariants of TF-IDF and BM25. Additional diversification is introduced by\ndifferent types of folds and random search optimization for different measures.\nThe ensemble algorithm optimizes macroFscore by predicting the documents for\neach label, instead of the usual prediction of labels per document. Scores for\ndocuments are predicted by weighted voting of base-classifier outputs with a\nvariant of Feature-Weighted Linear Stacking. The number of documents per label\nis chosen using label priors and thresholding of vote scores. This document\ndescribes the models and software used to build our solution. Reproducing the\nresults for our solution can be done by running the scripts included in the\nKaggle package. A package omitting precomputed result files is also\ndistributed. All code is open source, released under GNU GPL 2.0, and GPL 3.0\nfor Weka and Meka dependencies.", "published": "2014-05-03 01:41:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0546v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Automated Attribution and Intertextual Analysis", "abstract": "In this work, we employ quantitative methods from the realm of statistics and\nmachine learning to develop novel methodologies for author attribution and\ntextual analysis. In particular, we develop techniques and software suitable\nfor applications to Classical study, and we illustrate the efficacy of our\napproach in several interesting open questions in the field. We apply our\nnumerical analysis techniques to questions of authorship attribution in the\ncase of the Greek tragedian Euripides, to instances of intertextuality and\ninfluence in the poetry of the Roman statesman Seneca the Younger, and to cases\nof \"interpolated\" text with respect to the histories of Livy.", "published": "2014-05-03 19:02:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0616v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
