{"title": "Discriminating word senses with tourist walks in complex networks", "abstract": "Patterns of topological arrangement are widely used for both animal and human\nbrains in the learning process. Nevertheless, automatic learning techniques\nfrequently overlook these patterns. In this paper, we apply a learning\ntechnique based on the structural organization of the data in the attribute\nspace to the problem of discriminating the senses of 10 polysemous words. Using\ntwo types of characterization of meanings, namely semantical and topological\napproaches, we have observed significative accuracy rates in identifying the\nsuitable meanings in both techniques. Most importantly, we have found that the\ncharacterization based on the deterministic tourist walk improves the\ndisambiguation process when one compares with the discrimination achieved with\ntraditional complex networks measurements such as assortativity and clustering\ncoefficient. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such deterministic\nwalk has been applied to such a kind of problem. Therefore, our finding\nsuggests that the tourist walk characterization may be useful in other related\napplications.", "published": "2013-06-17 16:25:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3920v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
