{"title": "Does Syntactic Knowledge help English-Hindi SMT?", "abstract": "In this paper we explore various parameter settings of the state-of-art\nStatistical Machine Translation system to improve the quality of the\ntranslation for a `distant' language pair like English-Hindi. We proposed new\ntechniques for efficient reordering. A slight improvement over the baseline is\nreported using these techniques. We also show that a simple pre-processing step\ncan improve the quality of the translation significantly.", "published": "2014-01-20 11:49:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4869v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Review of Verbal and Non-Verbal Human-Robot Interactive Communication", "abstract": "In this paper, an overview of human-robot interactive communication is\npresented, covering verbal as well as non-verbal aspects of human-robot\ninteraction. Following a historical introduction, and motivation towards fluid\nhuman-robot communication, ten desiderata are proposed, which provide an\norganizational axis both of recent as well as of future research on human-robot\ncommunication. Then, the ten desiderata are examined in detail, culminating to\na unifying discussion, and a forward-looking conclusion.", "published": "2014-01-20 17:31:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4994v1", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
