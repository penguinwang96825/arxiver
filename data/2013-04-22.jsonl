{"title": "Dealing with natural language interfaces in a geolocation context", "abstract": "In the geolocation field where high-level programs and low-level devices\ncoexist, it is often difficult to find a friendly user inter- face to configure\nall the parameters. The challenge addressed in this paper is to propose\nintuitive and simple, thus natural lan- guage interfaces to interact with\nlow-level devices. Such inter- faces contain natural language processing and\nfuzzy represen- tations of words that facilitate the elicitation of\nbusiness-level objectives in our context.", "published": "2013-04-22 09:06:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5880v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Towards a Formal Distributional Semantics: Simulating Logical Calculi\n  with Tensors", "abstract": "The development of compositional distributional models of semantics\nreconciling the empirical aspects of distributional semantics with the\ncompositional aspects of formal semantics is a popular topic in the\ncontemporary literature. This paper seeks to bring this reconciliation one step\nfurther by showing how the mathematical constructs commonly used in\ncompositional distributional models, such as tensors and matrices, can be used\nto simulate different aspects of predicate logic.\n  This paper discusses how the canonical isomorphism between tensors and\nmultilinear maps can be exploited to simulate a full-blown quantifier-free\npredicate calculus using tensors. It provides tensor interpretations of the set\nof logical connectives required to model propositional calculi. It suggests a\nvariant of these tensor calculi capable of modelling quantifiers, using few\nnon-linear operations. It finally discusses the relation between these\nvariants, and how this relation should constitute the subject of future work.", "published": "2013-04-22 01:39:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5823v2", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.CL", "cs.LO", "68T50, 03B10", "F.4.1; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
