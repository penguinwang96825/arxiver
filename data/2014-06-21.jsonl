{"title": "A survey on phrase structure learning methods for text classification", "abstract": "Text classification is a task of automatic classification of text into one of\nthe predefined categories. The problem of text classification has been widely\nstudied in different communities like natural language processing, data mining\nand information retrieval. Text classification is an important constituent in\nmany information management tasks like topic identification, spam filtering,\nemail routing, language identification, genre classification, readability\nassessment etc. The performance of text classification improves notably when\nphrase patterns are used. The use of phrase patterns helps in capturing\nnon-local behaviours and thus helps in the improvement of text classification\ntask. Phrase structure extraction is the first step to continue with the phrase\npattern identification. In this survey, detailed study of phrase structure\nlearning methods have been carried out. This will enable future work in several\nNLP tasks, which uses syntactic information from phrase structure like grammar\ncheckers, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, text\nclassification. The paper also provides different levels of classification and\ndetailed comparison of the phrase structure learning methods.", "published": "2014-06-21 11:30:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5598v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
