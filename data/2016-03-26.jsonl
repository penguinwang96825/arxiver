{"title": "Measuring Book Impact Based on the Multi-granularity Online Review\n  Mining", "abstract": "As with articles and journals, the customary methods for measuring books'\nacademic impact mainly involve citations, which is easy but limited to\ninterrogating traditional citation databases and scholarly book reviews,\nResearchers have attempted to use other metrics, such as Google Books,\nlibcitation, and publisher prestige. However, these approaches lack\ncontent-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of\nusers. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic\nbooks can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric\nperspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by\nmulti-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a\nbook's impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn\nare crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted\nto identify review sentiment polarities and aspects' sentiment values. Lastly,\nthe numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values,\nstar values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the\nentropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores.\nThe results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our\nmethod versus traditional book citations show that, although there are\nsubstantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to\nreflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a\npromising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at\nthe multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also\nbe a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications.", "published": "2016-03-26 09:25:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08091v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
{"title": "Do You See What I Mean? Visual Resolution of Linguistic Ambiguities", "abstract": "Understanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate\ncomplex contextual information obtained via perception. In this work, we\npresent a novel task for grounded language understanding: disambiguating a\nsentence given a visual scene which depicts one of the possible interpretations\nof that sentence. To this end, we introduce a new multimodal corpus containing\nambiguous sentences, representing a wide range of syntactic, semantic and\ndiscourse ambiguities, coupled with videos that visualize the different\ninterpretations for each sentence. We address this task by extending a vision\nmodel which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video. We demonstrate how\nsuch a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpretations of the same\nunderlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a unified fashion\nacross the different ambiguity types.", "published": "2016-03-26 06:49:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08079v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Online shopping behavior study based on multi-granularity opinion\n  mining: China vs. America", "abstract": "With the development of e-commerce, many products are now being sold\nworldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain a better understanding of\ncustomer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous\nefforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and\ncostly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has\nseen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user\npreferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper\naddresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently\ndeveloped opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons.\nFirst, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing\nalgorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based\nanswer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports\nof customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct\ninformation, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second,\ninternational customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for\nmultilingual opinion mining. Third, this is the first time an automatic\nquestionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in\nChina and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and\nEnglish, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet\ncomputers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine\nof the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers\nexpress their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about\ngeneral feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product\ndetails. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American\ncustomers care more about the internal features of products.", "published": "2016-03-26 08:57:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08089v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
