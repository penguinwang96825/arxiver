{"title": "Deep Feature Factorization For Concept Discovery", "abstract": "We propose Deep Feature Factorization (DFF), a method capable of localizing similar semantic concepts within an image or a set of images. We use DFF to gain insight into a deep convolutional neural network's learned features, where we detect hierarchical cluster structures in feature space. This is visualized as heat maps, which highlight semantically matching regions across a set of images, revealing what the network `perceives' as similar. DFF can also be used to perform co-segmentation and co-localization, and we report state-of-the-art results on these tasks.", "published": "2018-06-26 20:39:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10206v5", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "MMSE Approximation For Sparse Coding Algorithms Using Stochastic Resonance", "abstract": "Sparse coding refers to the pursuit of the sparsest representation of a signal in a typically overcomplete dictionary. From a Bayesian perspective, sparse coding provides a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the unknown vector under a sparse prior. In this work, we suggest enhancing the performance of sparse coding algorithms by a deliberate and controlled contamination of the input with random noise, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. The proposed method adds controlled noise to the input and estimates a sparse representation from the perturbed signal. A set of such solutions is then obtained by projecting the original input signal onto the recovered set of supports. We present two variants of the described method, which differ in their final step. The first is a provably convergent approximation to the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, relying on the generative model and applying a weighted average over the recovered solutions. The second is a relaxed variant of the former that simply applies an empirical mean. We show that both methods provide a computationally efficient approximation to the MMSE estimator, which is typically intractable to compute. We demonstrate our findings empirically and provide a theoretical analysis of our method under several different cases.", "published": "2018-06-26 19:03:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10171v5", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Hierarchical VampPrior Variational Fair Auto-Encoder", "abstract": "Decision making is a process that is extremely prone to different biases. In this paper we consider learning fair representations that aim at removing nuisance (sensitive) information from the decision process. For this purpose, we propose to use deep generative modeling and adapt a hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder to learn these fair representations. Moreover, we utilize the mutual information as a useful regularizer for enforcing fairness of a representation. In experiments on two benchmark datasets and two scenarios where the sensitive variables are fully and partially observable, we show that the proposed approach either outperforms or performs on par with the current best model.", "published": "2018-06-26 11:31:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09918v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Learning a Compressed Sensing Measurement Matrix via Gradient Unrolling", "abstract": "Linear encoding of sparse vectors is widely popular, but is commonly data-independent -- missing any possible extra (but a priori unknown) structure beyond sparsity. In this paper we present a new method to learn linear encoders that adapt to data, while still performing well with the widely used $\\ell_1$ decoder. The convex $\\ell_1$ decoder prevents gradient propagation as needed in standard gradient-based training. Our method is based on the insight that unrolling the convex decoder into $T$ projected subgradient steps can address this issue. Our method can be seen as a data-driven way to learn a compressed sensing measurement matrix. We compare the empirical performance of 10 algorithms over 6 sparse datasets (3 synthetic and 3 real). Our experiments show that there is indeed additional structure beyond sparsity in the real datasets; our method is able to discover it and exploit it to create excellent reconstructions with fewer measurements (by a factor of 1.1-3x) compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods. We illustrate an application of our method in learning label embeddings for extreme multi-label classification, and empirically show that our method is able to match or outperform the precision scores of SLEEC, which is one of the state-of-the-art embedding-based approaches.", "published": "2018-06-26 19:11:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10175v4", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.IT", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Outage Probability of UAV Communications in the Presence of Interference", "abstract": "Unlike terrestrial communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications have some advantages such as line-of-sight (LoS) environment and flexible mobility, but the interference will be still inevitable. In this paper, we analyze the effect of interference on the UAV communications by considering the LoS probability and different channel fadings for LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links, affected by the elevation angle of communication link. We then derive a closed-form outage probability in the presence of interfering node for all the possible scenarios and environments of main and interference links. After discussing the impacts of transmitting and interfering node parameters on the outage probability, we show the existence of the optimal height of UAV that minimizes the outage probability. We also show NLoS environment can be better than LoS environment if the average received power of interference is more dominant than that of transmitting signal in UAV communications.", "published": "2018-06-26 08:47:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09843v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
