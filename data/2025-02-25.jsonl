{"title": "Adaptive Nesterov Accelerated Distributional Deep Hedging for Efficient Volatility Risk Management", "abstract": "In the field of financial derivatives trading, managing volatility risk is\ncrucial for protecting investment portfolios from market changes. Traditional\nVega hedging strategies, which often rely on basic and rule-based models, are\nhard to adapt well to rapidly changing market conditions. We introduce a new\nframework for dynamic Vega hedging, the Adaptive Nesterov Accelerated\nDistributional Deep Hedging (ANADDH), which combines distributional\nreinforcement learning with a tailored design based on adaptive Nesterov\nacceleration. This approach improves the learning process in complex financial\nenvironments by modeling the hedging efficiency distribution, providing a more\naccurate and responsive hedging strategy. The design of adaptive Nesterov\nacceleration refines gradient momentum adjustments, significantly enhancing the\nstability and speed of convergence of the model. Through empirical analysis and\ncomparisons, our method demonstrates substantial performance gains over\nexisting hedging techniques. Our results confirm that this innovative\ncombination of distributional reinforcement learning with the proposed\noptimization techniques improves financial risk management and highlights the\npractical benefits of implementing advanced neural network architectures in the\nfinance sector.", "published": "2025-02-25 02:12:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17777v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation", "abstract": "In econophysics, there are several enigmatic empirical laws: (i)~the\nmarket-order flow has strong persistence (long-range order-sign correlation),\nwell formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems\nparadoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the\nprice impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law,\n$I(Q)\\propto \\sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of\nthe nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize\nthe Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped\nto an exactly solvable L\\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical\nsimulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains\ndiffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation.\nSecond, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical\nexponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple\nmodel lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other\nenigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price\nstatistics and (iv)~volatility clustering. This work illustrates the crucial\nrole of the square-root law in understanding rich and complex financial price\ndynamics from a single coherent viewpoint.", "published": "2025-02-25 07:12:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks", "abstract": "The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a\ncritical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes\nand market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work\narXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated\nsignificant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly\noptimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve\npredictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully\nlinear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for\ndynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic\nneural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time.\nWe introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural\nnetworks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and\nsecond, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously\noptimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis,\nconducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this\ndynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional\nmethods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance\ngains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across\nvarying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures\ncan effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while\nmaintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.", "published": "2025-02-25 13:11:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18177v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "LLM Knows Geometry Better than Algebra: Numerical Understanding of LLM-Based Agents in A Trading Arena", "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nimproved performance in natural language processing tasks. However, their\nability to generalize to dynamic, unseen tasks, particularly in numerical\nreasoning, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks mainly evaluate LLMs on\nproblems with predefined optimal solutions, which may not align with real-world\nscenarios where clear answers are absent. To bridge this gap, we design the\nAgent Trading Arena, a virtual numerical game simulating complex economic\nsystems through zero-sum games, where agents invest in stock portfolios. Our\nexperiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with algebraic\nreasoning when dealing with plain-text stock data, often focusing on local\ndetails rather than global trends. In contrast, LLMs perform significantly\nbetter with geometric reasoning when presented with visual data, such as\nscatter plots or K-line charts, suggesting that visual representations enhance\nnumerical reasoning. This capability is further improved by incorporating the\nreflection module, which aids in the analysis and interpretation of complex\ndata. We validate our findings on NASDAQ Stock dataset, where LLMs demonstrate\nstronger reasoning with visual data compared to text.
