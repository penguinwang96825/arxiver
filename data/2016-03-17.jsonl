{"title": "Predicate Gradual Logic and Linguistics", "abstract": "There are several major proposals for treating donkey anaphora such as\ndiscourse representation theory and the likes, or E-Type theories and the\nlikes. Every one of them works well for a set of specific examples that they\nuse to demonstrate validity of their approaches. As I show in this paper,\nhowever, they are not very generalisable and do not account for essentially the\nsame problem that they remedy when it manifests in other examples. I propose\nanother logical approach. I develoop logic that extends a recent, propositional\ngradual logic, and show that it can treat donkey anaphora generally. I also\nidentify and address a problem around the modern convention on existential\nimport. Furthermore, I show that Aristotle's syllogisms and conversion are\nrealisable in this logic.", "published": "2016-03-17 16:43:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05570v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Self-organization of vocabularies under different interaction orders", "abstract": "Traditionally, the formation of vocabularies has been studied by agent-based\nmodels (specially, the Naming Game) in which random pairs of agents negotiate\nword-meaning associations at each discrete time step. This paper proposes a\nfirst approximation to a novel question: To what extent the negotiation of\nword-meaning associations is influenced by the order in which the individuals\ninteract? Automata Networks provide the adequate mathematical framework to\nexplore this question. Computer simulations suggest that on two-dimensional\nlattices the typical features of the formation of word-meaning associations are\nrecovered under random schemes that update small fractions of the population at\nthe same time.", "published": "2016-03-17 03:54:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05350v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Modeling self-organization of vocabularies under phonological similarity\n  effects", "abstract": "This work develops a computational model (by Automata Networks) of\nphonological similarity effects involved in the formation of word-meaning\nassociations on artificial populations of speakers. Classical studies show that\nin recalling experiments memory performance was impaired for phonologically\nsimilar words versus dissimilar ones. Here, the individuals confound\nphonologically similar words according to a predefined parameter. The main\nhypothesis is that there is a critical range of the parameter, and with this,\nof working-memory mechanisms, which implies drastic changes in the final\nconsensus of the entire population. Theoretical results present proofs of\nconvergence for a particular case of the model within a worst-case complexity\nframework. Computer simulations describe the evolution of an energy function\nthat measures the amount of local agreement between individuals. The main\nfinding is the appearance of sudden changes in the energy function at critical\nparameters.", "published": "2016-03-17 04:39:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05354v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Predicting health inspection results from online restaurant reviews", "abstract": "Informatics around public health are increasingly shifting from the\nprofessional to the public spheres. In this work, we apply linguistic analytics\nto restaurant reviews, from Yelp, in order to automatically predict official\nhealth inspection reports. We consider two types of feature sets, i.e., keyword\ndetection and topic model features, and use these in several classification\nmethods. Our empirical analysis shows that these extracted features can predict\npublic health inspection reports with over 90% accuracy using simple support\nvector machines.", "published": "2016-03-17 20:20:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05673v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Bank distress in the news: Describing events through deep learning", "abstract": "While many models are purposed for detecting the occurrence of significant\nevents in financial systems, the task of providing qualitative detail on the\ndevelopments is not usually as well automated. We present a deep learning\napproach for detecting relevant discussion in text and extracting natural\nlanguage descriptions of events. Supervised by only a small set of event\ninformation, comprising entity names and dates, the model is leveraged by\nunsupervised learning of semantic vector representations on extensive text\ndata. We demonstrate applicability to the study of financial risk based on news\n(6.6M articles), particularly bank distress and government interventions (243\nevents), where indices can signal the level of bank-stress-related reporting at\nthe entity level, or aggregated at national or European level, while being\ncoupled with explanations. Thus, we exemplify how text, as timely, widely\navailable and descriptive data, can serve as a useful complementary source of\ninformation for financial and systemic risk analytics.", "published": "2016-03-17 20:06:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05670v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "cs.NE", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
