{"title": "Automatic Ranking of MT Outputs using Approximations", "abstract": "Since long, research on machine translation has been ongoing. Still, we do\nnot get good translations from MT engines so developed. Manual ranking of these\noutputs tends to be very time consuming and expensive. Identifying which one is\nbetter or worse than the others is a very taxing task. In this paper, we show\nan approach which can provide automatic ranks to MT outputs (translations)\ntaken from different MT Engines and which is based on N-gram approximations. We\nprovide a solution where no human intervention is required for ranking systems.\nFurther we also show the evaluations of our results which show equivalent\nresults as that of human ranking.", "published": "2013-11-22 18:13:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5836v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
