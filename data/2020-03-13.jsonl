{"title": "Neural Network Tracking of Moving Objects with Unknown Equations of Motion", "abstract": "In this paper we present a Neural Network design that can be used to track the location of a moving object within a given range based on the object's noisy coordinates measurement. A function commonly performed by the KLMn filter, our goal is to show that our method outperforms the Kalman filter in certain scenarios.", "published": "2020-03-13 13:16:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08362v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.CV", "eess.IV"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
