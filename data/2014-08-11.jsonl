{"title": "Gap-weighted subsequences for automatic cognate identification and\n  phylogenetic inference", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the problem of cognate identification and its\nrelation to phylogenetic inference. We introduce subsequence based features for\ndiscriminating cognates from non-cognates. We show that subsequence based\nfeatures perform better than the state-of-the-art string similarity measures\nfor the purpose of cognate identification. We use the cognate judgments for the\npurpose of phylogenetic inference and observe that these classifiers infer a\ntree which is close to the gold standard tree. The contribution of this paper\nis the use of subsequence features for cognate identification and to employ the\ncognate judgments for phylogenetic inference.", "published": "2014-08-11 09:32:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2359v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Optimizing Component Combination in a Multi-Indexing Paragraph Retrieval\n  System", "abstract": "We demonstrate a method to optimize the combination of distinct components in\na paragraph retrieval system. Our system makes use of several indices, query\ngenerators and filters, each of them potentially contributing to the quality of\nthe returned list of results. The components are combined with a weighed sum,\nand we optimize the weights using a heuristic optimization algorithm. This\nallows us to maximize the quality of our results, but also to determine which\ncomponents are most valuable in our system. We evaluate our approach on the\nparagraph selection task of a Question Answering dataset.", "published": "2014-08-11 14:58:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2430v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "68T50"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
