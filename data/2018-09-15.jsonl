{"title": "Kernelization and approximation of distance-$r$ independent sets on nowhere dense graphs", "abstract": "For a positive integer $r$, a distance-$r$ independent set in an undirected graph $G$ is a set $I\\subseteq V(G)$ of vertices pairwise at distance greater than $r$, while a distance-$r$ dominating set is a set $D\\subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex of the graph is within distance at most $r$ from a vertex from $D$. We study the duality between the maximum size of a distance-$2r$ independent set and the minimum size of a distance-$r$ dominating set in nowhere dense graph classes, as well as the kernelization complexity of the distance-$r$ independent set problem on these graph classes. Specifically, we prove that the distance-$r$ independent set problem admits an almost linear kernel on every nowhere dense graph class.", "published": "2018-09-15 08:50:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05675v2", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Kernel-based collocation methods for Heath-Jarrow-Morton models with Musiela parametrization", "abstract": "We propose kernel-based collocation methods for numerical solutions to Heath-Jarrow-Morton models with Musiela parametrization. The methods can be seen as the Euler-Maruyama approximation of some finite dimensional stochastic differential equations, and allow us to compute the derivative prices by the usual Monte Carlo methods. We derive a bound on the rate of convergence under some decay condition on the inverse of the interpolation matrix and some regularity conditions on the volatility functionals.", "published": "2018-09-15 03:45:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05643v4", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.NA", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
