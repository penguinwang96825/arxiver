{"title": "Option Pricing with Stochastic Volatility, Equity Premium, and Interest Rates", "abstract": "This paper presents a new model for options pricing. The Black-Scholes-Merton\n(BSM) model plays an important role in financial options pricing. However, the\nBSM model assumes that the risk-free interest rate, volatility, and equity\npremium are constant, which is unrealistic in the real market. To address this,\nour paper considers the time-varying characteristics of those parameters. Our\nmodel integrates elements of the BSM model, the Heston (1993) model for\nstochastic variance, the Vasicek model (1977) for stochastic interest rates,\nand the Campbell and Viceira model (1999, 2001) for stochastic equity premium.\nWe derive a linear second-order parabolic PDE and extend our model to encompass\nfixed-strike Asian options, yielding a new PDE. In the absence of closed-form\nsolutions for any options from our new model, we utilize finite difference\nmethods to approximate prices for European call and up-and-out barrier options,\nand outline the numerical implementation for fixed-strike Asian call options.", "published": "2024-08-27 21:45:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15416v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.AP", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
