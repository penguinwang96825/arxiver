{"title": "KSU KDD: Word Sense Induction by Clustering in Topic Space", "abstract": "We describe our language-independent unsupervised word sense induction\nsystem. This system only uses topic features to cluster different word senses\nin their global context topic space. Using unlabeled data, this system trains a\nlatent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model then uses it to infer the topics\ndistribution of the test instances. By clustering these topics distributions in\ntheir topic space we cluster them into different senses. Our hypothesis is that\ncloseness in topic space reflects similarity between different word senses.\nThis system participated in SemEval-2 word sense induction and disambiguation\ntask and achieved the second highest V-measure score among all other systems.", "published": "2013-02-28 02:10:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7056v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "stat.AP", "stat.ML", "68T05"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
