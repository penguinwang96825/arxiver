{"title": "TWICE: What Advantages Can Low-Resource Domain-Specific Embedding Model Bring? -- A Case Study on Korea Financial Texts", "abstract": "Domain specificity of embedding models is critical for effective performance.\nHowever, existing benchmarks, such as FinMTEB, are primarily designed for\nhigh-resource languages, leaving low-resource settings, such as Korean,\nunder-explored. Directly translating established English benchmarks often fails\nto capture the linguistic and cultural nuances present in low-resource domains.\nIn this paper, titled TWICE: What Advantages Can Low-Resource Domain-Specific\nEmbedding Models Bring? A Case Study on Korea Financial Texts, we introduce\nKorFinMTEB, a novel benchmark for the Korean financial domain, specifically\ntailored to reflect its unique cultural characteristics in low-resource\nlanguages. Our experimental results reveal that while the models perform\nrobustly on a translated version of FinMTEB, their performance on KorFinMTEB\nuncovers subtle yet critical discrepancies, especially in tasks requiring\ndeeper semantic understanding, that underscore the limitations of direct\ntranslation. This discrepancy highlights the necessity of benchmarks that\nincorporate language-specific idiosyncrasies and cultural nuances. The insights\nfrom our study advocate for the development of domain-specific evaluation\nframeworks that can more accurately assess and drive the progress of embedding\nmodels in low-resource settings.", "published": "2025-02-10 23:49:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07131v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A nested MLMC framework for efficient simulations on FPGAs", "abstract": "Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) reduces the total computational cost of\nfinancial option pricing by combining SDE approximations with multiple\nresolutions. This paper explores a further avenue for reducing cost and\nimproving power efficiency through the use of low precision calculations on\nconfigurable hardware devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).\nWe propose a new framework that exploits approximate random variables and\nfixed-point operations with optimised precision to generate most SDE paths with\na lower cost and reduce the overall cost of the MLMC framework. We first\ndiscuss several methods for the cheap generation of approximate random Normal\nincrements. To set the bit-width of variables in the path generation we then\npropose a rounding error model and optimise the precision of all variables on\neach MLMC level. With these key improvements, our proposed framework offers\nhigher computational savings than the existing mixed-precision MLMC frameworks.", "published": "2025-02-10 23:36:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07123v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.NA", "math.NA", "65C05, 91G60, 65G50, 65C10"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
