{"title": "Prior Polarity Lexical Resources for the Italian Language", "abstract": "In this paper we present SABRINA (Sentiment Analysis: a Broad Resource for\nItalian Natural language Applications) a manually annotated prior polarity\nlexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the field of\nopinion mining and sentiment induction. The resource consists in two different\nsets, an Italian dictionary of more than 277.000 words tagged with their prior\npolarity value, and a set of polarity modifiers, containing more than 200\nwords, which can be used in combination with non neutral terms of the\ndictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms. To the\nbest of our knowledge this is the first prior polarity manually annotated\nresource which has been developed for the Italian natural language.", "published": "2015-07-01 07:29:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00133v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Dimensionality on Summarization", "abstract": "Summarization is one of the key features of human intelligence. It plays an\nimportant role in understanding and representation. With rapid and continual\nexpansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization\nbecomes more and more desirable. Text summarization has been studied for over\nhalf century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied\nsummary. Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the\nfundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding.\nThis paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a\nmulti-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional\nmethodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and\nprinciples of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental\nmechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of\nrepresentations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms.\nInvestigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the\nsummarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general\nsummarization framework.", "published": "2015-07-01 12:39:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00209v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
