{"title": "A Counterexample in Ito Integration Theory", "abstract": "Ito's Lemma implies that if $W$ is a Wiener process and $f$ is a twice continuously differentiable function, then the process $f(W)$ is the sum of a time integral and an Ito integral. The Ito integrand is not necessarily locally square integrable. This note provides a counterexample.", "published": "2023-05-18 04:14:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10695v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
