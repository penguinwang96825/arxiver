{"title": "Noise Robust IOA/CAS Speech Separation and Recognition System For The\n  Third 'CHIME' Challenge", "abstract": "This paper presents the contribution to the third 'CHiME' speech separation\nand recognition challenge including both front-end signal processing and\nback-end speech recognition. In the front-end, Multi-channel Wiener filter\n(MWF) is designed to achieve background noise reduction. Different from\ntraditional MWF, optimized parameter for the tradeoff between noise reduction\nand target signal distortion is built according to the desired noise reduction\nlevel. In the back-end, several techniques are taken advantage to improve the\nnoisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance including Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory\n(LSTM) using medium vocabulary, Lattice rescoring with a big vocabulary\nlanguage model finite state transducer, and ROVER scheme. Experimental results\nshow the proposed system combining front-end and back-end is effective to\nimprove the ASR performance.", "published": "2015-09-21 03:37:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06103v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
