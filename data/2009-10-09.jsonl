{"title": "Finding a sun in building-free graphs", "abstract": "Deciding whether an arbitrary graph contains a sun was recently shown to be NP-complete. We show that whether a building-free graph contains a sun can be decided in O(min$\\{m{n^3}, m^{1.5}n^2\\}$) time and, if a sun exists, it can be found in the same time bound. The class of building-free graphs contains many interesting classes of perfect graphs such as Meyniel graphs which, in turn, contains classes such as hhd-free graphs, i-triangulated graphs, and parity graphs. Moreover, there are imperfect graphs that are building-free. The class of building-free graphs generalizes several classes of graphs for which an efficient test for the presence of a sun is known. We also present a vertex elimination scheme for the class of (building, gem)-free graphs. The class of (building, gem)-free graphs is a generalization of the class of distance hereditary graphs and a restriction of the class of (building, sun)-free graphs.", "published": "2009-10-09 18:11:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1808v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
