{"title": "Learning Vague Concepts for the Semantic Web", "abstract": "Ontologies can be a powerful tool for structuring knowledge, and they are\ncurrently the subject of extensive research. Updating the contents of an\nontology or improving its interoperability with other ontologies is an\nimportant but difficult process. In this paper, we focus on the presence of\nvague concepts, which are pervasive in natural language, within the framework\nof formal ontologies. We will adopt a framework in which vagueness is captured\nvia numerical restrictions that can be automatically adjusted. Since updating\nvague concepts, either through ontology alignment or ontology evolution, can\nlead to inconsistent sets of axioms, we define and implement a method to\ndetecting and repairing such inconsistencies in a local fashion.", "published": "2014-10-19 14:34:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5078v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
