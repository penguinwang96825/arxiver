In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies.

For WM, to solve\nthe highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and\nfractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is\ninvoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented\nLagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling\nconstraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting\naugmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is\nextended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a\nlow-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS\nstructure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the\nlarge-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1)\nthe MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to\nconventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for\nunicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap\nbetween WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are\ngeographically isolated.", "published": "2025-08-20 06:27:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14458v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State\nSpace Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,\nchunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)\nmemories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and\ncomplexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably\nactivate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale\nprototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose\nsole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative\nscaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and\ncontrollable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.\nWe explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory\nutilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to\nstimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM\nefficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,\nHydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language\nmodels; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.", "published": "2025-08-20 22:31:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15099v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "MeshCoder: LLM-Powered Structured Mesh Code Generation from Point Clouds", "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications\nlike reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often\nrely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,\nrestricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that\nreconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python\nscripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into\nexecutable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these\ncontributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for\nprogrammatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

{"title": "Building and Measuring Trust between Large Language Models", "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with each other, most\nnotably in multi-agent setups, we may expect (and hope) that `trust'\nrelationships develop between them, mirroring trust relationships between human\ncolleagues, friends, or partners. Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be\ncapable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in\ntrust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build\ntrust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how\nthis relates to explicit measures of trust.\n  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.\nsusceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with\nexplicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established\nin psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,\nby starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the\nLLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust\nare either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.\nThese findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their\nopinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may\nbe more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other.", "published": "2025-08-20 11:38:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15858v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Robust Residual Finite Scalar Quantization for Neural Compression", "abstract": "Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to\nVector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training\nand improved stability.

{"title": "MGSC: A Multi-granularity Consistency Framework for Robust End-to-end Asr", "abstract": "End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce\ncatastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility\nto the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final\noutput errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess\nunconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft\nConsistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that\nenforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level\nsentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the\nfirst to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency\ngranularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that\nsignificantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public\ndataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%\nacross diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere\nmeaning-altering mistakes.

{"title": "Fast reliable pricing and calibration of the rough Heston model", "abstract": "The paper is an extended and modified version of the preprint S.Boyarchenko\nand S.Levendorski\\u{i} ``Correct implied volatility shapes and reliable pricing\nin the rough Heston model\". We combine a modification of the Adams method with\nthe SINH-acceleration method S.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorskii (IJTAF 2019,\nv.22) of Fourier inversion (iFT) to price vanilla options under the rough\nHeston model. For moderate or long maturities and strikes near spot, thousands\nof prices are computed in several milliseconds (ms) in Matlab on a Mac with\nmoderate specs, with relative errors $\\lesssim 10^{-4}$. Even for options close\nto expiry and far-OTM, the pricing takes a few tens or hundreds of ms. We show\nthat, for the calibrated parameters in El Euch and Rosenbaum (Math.Finance\n2019, v.29), the model implied vol surface is much flatter and fits the market\ndata poorly; thus the calibration in op.cit. is a case of ``ghost calibration''\n(M.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorski\\u{i}, Quant.

We explain how such\nerrors arise in popular iFT implementations that use fixed numerical\nparameters, yielding spurious smiles/skews, and provide numerical evidence that\nSINH acceleration is faster and more accurate than competing methods. Robust\nerror control is ensured by a general Conformal Bootstrap principle that we\nformulate; the principle is applicable to many Fourier-pricing methods. We\noutline how this principle and our method enable accurate calibration\nprocedures that are hundreds of times faster than approaches commonly used in\nthe industry.
