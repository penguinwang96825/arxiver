{"title": "ARKref: a rule-based coreference resolution system", "abstract": "ARKref is a tool for noun phrase coreference. It is a deterministic,\nrule-based system that uses syntactic information from a constituent parser,\nand semantic information from an entity recognition component. Its architecture\nis based on the work of Haghighi and Klein (2009). ARKref was originally\nwritten in 2009. At the time of writing, the last released version was in March\n2011. This document describes that version, which is open-source and publicly\navailable at: http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/ARKref", "published": "2013-10-08 00:30:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1975v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Treating clitics with minimalist grammars", "abstract": "We propose an extension of Stabler's version of clitics treatment for a wider\ncoverage of the French language. For this, we present the lexical entries\nneeded in the lexicon. Then, we show the recognition of complex syntactic\nphenomena as (left and right) dislo- cation, clitic climbing over modal and\nextraction from determiner phrase. The aim of this presentation is the\nsyntax-semantic interface for clitics analyses in which we will stress on\nclitic climbing over verb and raising verb.", "published": "2013-10-08 17:19:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2527v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Optimization Of Cross Domain Sentiment Analysis Using Sentiwordnet", "abstract": "The task of sentiment analysis of reviews is carried out using manually built\n/ automatically generated lexicon resources of their own with which terms are\nmatched with lexicon to compute the term count for positive and negative\npolarity. On the other hand the Sentiwordnet, which is quite different from\nother lexicon resources that gives scores (weights) of the positive and\nnegative polarity for each word. The polarity of a word namely positive,\nnegative and neutral have the score ranging between 0 to 1 indicates the\nstrength/weight of the word with that sentiment orientation. In this paper, we\nshow that using the Sentiwordnet, how we could enhance the performance of the\nclassification at both sentence and document level.", "published": "2013-10-08 13:48:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3230v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
