{"title": "Speech Recognition Challenge in the Wild: Arabic MGB-3", "abstract": "This paper describes the Arabic MGB-3 Challenge - Arabic Speech Recognition\nin the Wild. Unlike last year's Arabic MGB-2 Challenge, for which the\nrecognition task was based on more than 1,200 hours broadcast TV news\nrecordings from Aljazeera Arabic TV programs, MGB-3 emphasises dialectal Arabic\nusing a multi-genre collection of Egyptian YouTube videos. Seven genres were\nused for the data collection: comedy, cooking, family/kids, fashion, drama,\nsports, and science (TEDx). A total of 16 hours of videos, split evenly across\nthe different genres, were divided into adaptation, development and evaluation\ndata sets. The Arabic MGB-Challenge comprised two tasks: A) Speech\ntranscription, evaluated on the MGB-3 test set, along with the 10 hour MGB-2\ntest set to report progress on the MGB-2 evaluation; B) Arabic dialect\nidentification, introduced this year in order to distinguish between four major\nArabic dialects - Egyptian, Levantine, North African, Gulf, as well as Modern\nStandard Arabic. Two hours of audio per dialect were released for development\nand a further two hours were used for evaluation. For dialect identification,\nboth lexical features and i-vector bottleneck features were shared with\nparticipants in addition to the raw audio recordings. Overall, thirteen teams\nsubmitted ten systems to the challenge. We outline the approaches adopted in\neach system, and summarise the evaluation results.", "published": "2017-09-21 12:10:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07276v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Retrofitting Concept Vector Representations of Medical Concepts to\n  Improve Estimates of Semantic Similarity and Relatedness", "abstract": "Estimation of semantic similarity and relatedness between biomedical concepts\nhas utility for many informatics applications. Automated methods fall into two\ncategories: methods based on distributional statistics drawn from text corpora,\nand methods using the structure of existing knowledge resources. Methods in the\nformer category disregard taxonomic structure, while those in the latter fail\nto consider semantically relevant empirical information. In this paper, we\npresent a method that retrofits distributional context vector representations\nof biomedical concepts using structural information from the UMLS\nMetathesaurus, such that the similarity between vector representations of\nlinked concepts is augmented. We evaluated it on the UMNSRS benchmark. Our\nresults demonstrate that retrofitting of concept vector representations leads\nto better correlation with human raters for both similarity and relatedness,\nsurpassing the best results reported to date. They also demonstrate a clear\nimprovement in performance on this reference standard for retrofitted vector\nrepresentations, as compared to those without retrofitting.", "published": "2017-09-21 14:51:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07357v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Inducing Distant Supervision in Suggestion Mining through Part-of-Speech\n  Embeddings", "abstract": "Mining suggestion expressing sentences from a given text is a less\ninvestigated sentence classification task, and therefore lacks hand labeled\nbenchmark datasets. In this work, we propose and evaluate two approaches for\ndistant supervision in suggestion mining. The distant supervision is obtained\nthrough a large silver standard dataset, constructed using the text from\nwikiHow and Wikipedia. Both the approaches use a LSTM based neural network\narchitecture to learn a classification model for suggestion mining, but vary in\ntheir method to use the silver standard dataset. The first approach directly\ntrains the classifier using this dataset, while the second approach only learns\nword embeddings from this dataset. In the second approach, we also learn POS\nembeddings, which interestingly gives the best classification accuracy.", "published": "2017-09-21 16:40:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07403v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning Domain-Specific Word Embeddings from Sparse Cybersecurity Texts", "abstract": "Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that\nautomatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in an\nembedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost the\nperformance of a vari-ety of NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition,\nSyntac-tic Parsing and Sentiment Analysis. Classic word embedding methods such\nas Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. When\nthe input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g.,\ncybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. In\nthis pa-per, we describe a novel method to train domain-specificword embeddings\nfrom sparse texts. In addition to domain texts, our method also leverages\ndiverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary and semantic\nrelations. Specifi-cally, we first propose a general framework to encode\ndiverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations. Then we de-velop a novel\nWord Annotation Embedding (WAE) algorithm to incorporate diverse types of text\nannotations in word em-bedding. We have evaluated our method on two\ncybersecurity text corpora: a malware description corpus and a Common\nVulnerability and Exposure (CVE) corpus. Our evaluation re-sults have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our method in learning domain-specific word\nembeddings.", "published": "2017-09-21 18:17:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07470v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "WERd: Using Social Text Spelling Variants for Evaluating Dialectal\n  Speech Recognition", "abstract": "We study the problem of evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems\nthat target dialectal speech input. A major challenge in this case is that the\northography of dialects is typically not standardized. From an ASR evaluation\nperspective, this means that there is no clear gold standard for the expected\noutput, and several possible outputs could be considered correct according to\ndifferent human annotators, which makes standard word error rate (WER)\ninadequate as an evaluation metric. Such a situation is typical for machine\ntranslation (MT), and thus we borrow ideas from an MT evaluation metric, namely\nTERp, an extension of translation error rate which is closely-related to WER.\nIn particular, in the process of comparing a hypothesis to a reference, we make\nuse of spelling variants for words and phrases, which we mine from Twitter in\nan unsupervised fashion. Our experiments with evaluating ASR output for\nEgyptian Arabic, and further manual analysis, show that the resulting WERd\n(i.e., WER for dialects) metric, a variant of TERp, is more adequate than WER\nfor evaluating dialectal ASR.", "published": "2017-09-21 18:37:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07484v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T10", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Analyzing users' sentiment towards popular consumer industries and\n  brands on Twitter", "abstract": "Social media serves as a unified platform for users to express their thoughts\non subjects ranging from their daily lives to their opinion on consumer brands\nand products. These users wield an enormous influence in shaping the opinions\nof other consumers and influence brand perception, brand loyalty and brand\nadvocacy. In this paper, we analyze the opinion of 19M Twitter users towards 62\npopular industries, encompassing 12,898 enterprise and consumer brands, as well\nas associated subject matter topics, via sentiment analysis of 330M tweets over\na period spanning a month. We find that users tend to be most positive towards\nmanufacturing and most negative towards service industries. In addition, they\ntend to be more positive or negative when interacting with brands than\ngenerally on Twitter. We also find that sentiment towards brands within an\nindustry varies greatly and we demonstrate this using two industries as use\ncases. In addition, we discover that there is no strong correlation between\ntopic sentiments of different industries, demonstrating that topic sentiments\nare highly dependent on the context of the industry that they are mentioned in.\nWe demonstrate the value of such an analysis in order to assess the impact of\nbrands on social media. We hope that this initial study will prove valuable for\nboth researchers and companies in understanding users' perception of\nindustries, brands and associated topics and encourage more research in this\nfield.", "published": "2017-09-21 17:50:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07434v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Broadband Multizone Sound Rendering by Jointly Optimizing the Sound\n  Pressure and Particle Velocity", "abstract": "In this paper, a recently proposed approach to multizone sound field\nsynthesis, referred to as Joint Pressure and Velocity Matching (JPVM), is\ninvestigated analytically using a spherical harmonics representation of the\nsound field. The approach is motivated by the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral\nequation and aims at controlling the sound field inside the local listening\nzones by evoking the sound pressure and particle velocity on surrounding\ncontours. Based on the findings of the modal analysis, an improved version of\nJPVM is proposed which provides both better performance and lower complexity.\nIn particular, it is shown analytically that the optimization of the tangential\ncomponent of the particle velocity vector, as is done in the original JPVM\napproach, is very susceptible to errors and thus not pursued anymore. The\nanalysis furthermore provides fundamental insights as to how the spherical\nharmonics used to describe the 3D variant sound field translate into 2D basis\nfunctions as observed on the contours surrounding the zones. By means of\nsimulations, it is verified that discarding the tangential component of the\nparticle velocity vector ultimately leads to an improved performance. Finally,\nthe impact of sensor noise on the reproduction performance is assessed.", "published": "2017-09-21 11:46:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07269v3", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
