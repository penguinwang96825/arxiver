{"title": "Translation Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network", "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to the shared task on word/phrase level\nQuality Estimation (QE) in the First Conference on Statistical Machine\nTranslation (WMT16). The objective of the shared task was to predict if the\ngiven word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given\nsentence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for word level Quality\nEstimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture.\nRNN-LMs have been found very effective in different Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) applications. RNN-LM is mainly used for vector space language modeling\nfor different NLP problems. For this task, we modify the architecture of\nRNN-LM. The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD) in the slot rather than\npredicting the word. The input to the system is a word sequence, similar to the\nstandard RNN-LM. The approach is language independent and requires only the\ntranslated text for QE. To estimate the phrase level quality, we use the output\nof the word level QE system.", "published": "2016-10-16 10:54:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04841v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Term-Class-Max-Support (TCMS): A Simple Text Document Categorization\n  Approach Using Term-Class Relevance Measure", "abstract": "In this paper, a simple text categorization method using term-class relevance\nmeasures is proposed. Initially, text documents are processed to extract\nsignificant terms present in them. For every term extracted from a document, we\ncompute its importance in preserving the content of a class through a novel\nterm-weighting scheme known as Term_Class Relevance (TCR) measure proposed by\nGuru and Suhil (2015) [1]. In this way, for every term, its relevance for all\nthe classes present in the corpus is computed and stored in the knowledgebase.\nDuring testing, the terms present in the test document are extracted and the\nterm-class relevance of each term is obtained from the stored knowledgebase. To\nachieve quick search of term weights, Btree indexing data structure has been\nadapted. Finally, the class which receives maximum support in terms of\nterm-class relevance is decided to be the class of the given test document. The\nproposed method works in logarithmic complexity in testing time and simple to\nimplement when compared to any other text categorization techniques available\nin literature. The experiments conducted on various benchmarking datasets have\nrevealed that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactory and\nencouraging.", "published": "2016-10-16 03:40:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04814v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
