{"title": "Time-sync Video Tag Extraction Using Semantic Association Graph", "abstract": "Time-sync comments reveal a new way of extracting the online video tags. However, such time-sync comments have lots of noises due to users' diverse comments, introducing great challenges for accurate and fast video tag extractions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised video tag extraction algorithm named Semantic Weight-Inverse Document Frequency (SW-IDF). Specifically, we first generate corresponding semantic association graph (SAG) using semantic similarities and timestamps of the time-sync comments. Second, we propose two graph cluster algorithms, i.e., dialogue-based algorithm and topic center-based algorithm, to deal with the videos with different density of comments. Third, we design a graph iteration algorithm to assign the weight to each comment based on the degrees of the clustered subgraphs, which can differentiate the meaningful comments from the noises. Finally, we gain the weight of each word by combining Semantic Weight (SW) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). In this way, the video tags are extracted automatically in an unsupervised way. Extensive experiments have shown that SW-IDF (dialogue-based algorithm) achieves 0.4210 F1-score and 0.4932 MAP (Mean Average Precision) in high-density comments, 0.4267 F1-score and 0.3623 MAP in low-density comments; while SW-IDF (topic center-based algorithm) achieves 0.4444 F1-score and 0.5122 MAP in high-density comments, 0.4207 F1-score and 0.3522 MAP in low-density comments. It has a better performance than the state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms in both F1-score and MAP.", "published": "2019-05-03 07:30:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01053v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.MM"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Personalized Query Auto-Completion Through a Lightweight Representation of the User Context", "abstract": "Query Auto-Completion (QAC) is a widely used feature in many domains, including web and eCommerce search, suggesting full queries based on a prefix typed by the user. QAC has been extensively studied in the literature in the recent years, and it has been consistently shown that adding personalization features can significantly improve the performance of QAC. In this work we propose a novel method for personalized QAC that uses lightweight embeddings learnt through fastText. We construct an embedding for the user context queries, which are the last few queries issued by the user. We also use the same model to get the embedding for the candidate queries to be ranked. We introduce ranking features that compute the distance between the candidate queries and the context queries in the embedding space. These features are then combined with other commonly used QAC ranking features to learn a ranking model. We apply our method to a large eCommerce search engine (eBay) and show that the ranker with our proposed feature significantly outperforms the baselines on all of the offline metrics measured, which includes Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Success Rate (SR), Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Our baselines include the Most Popular Completion (MPC) model as well as a ranking model without our proposed features. The ranking model with the proposed features results in a $20-30\\%$ improvement over the MPC model on all metrics. We obtain up to a $5\\%$ improvement over the baseline ranking model for all the sessions, which goes up to about $10\\%$ when we restrict to sessions that contain the user context. Moreover, our proposed features also significantly outperform text based personalization features studied in the literature before, and adding text based features on top of our proposed embedding based features results only in minor improvements.", "published": "2019-05-03 23:28:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01386v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A Relation Extraction Approach for Clinical Decision Support", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how semantic relations between concepts extracted from medical documents can be employed to improve the retrieval of medical literature. Semantic relations explicitly represent relatedness between concepts and carry high informative power that can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of retrieval functionalities of clinical decision support systems. We present preliminary results and show how relations are able to provide a sizable increase of the precision for several topics, albeit having no impact on others. We then discuss some future directions to minimize the impact of negative results while maximizing the impact of good results.", "published": "2019-05-03 16:22:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01257v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
