{"title": "Balanced Vertices in Trees and a Simpler Algorithm to Compute the Genomic Distance", "abstract": "This paper provides a short and transparent solution for the covering cost of white-grey trees which play a crucial role in the algorithm of Bergeron {\\it et al.}\\ to compute the rearrangement distance between two multichromosomal genomes in linear time ({\\it Theor. Comput. Sci.}, 410:5300-5316, 2009). In the process it introduces a new {\\em center} notion for trees, which seems to be interesting on its own.", "published": "2010-04-15 23:44:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2735v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
