{"title": "Modelling, Visualising and Summarising Documents with a Single\n  Convolutional Neural Network", "abstract": "Capturing the compositional process which maps the meaning of words to that\nof documents is a central challenge for researchers in Natural Language\nProcessing and Information Retrieval. We introduce a model that is able to\nrepresent the meaning of documents by embedding them in a low dimensional\nvector space, while preserving distinctions of word and sentence order crucial\nfor capturing nuanced semantics. Our model is based on an extended Dynamic\nConvolution Neural Network, which learns convolution filters at both the\nsentence and document level, hierarchically learning to capture and compose low\nlevel lexical features into high level semantic concepts. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this model on a range of document modelling tasks, achieving\nstrong results with no feature engineering and with a more compact model.\nInspired by recent advances in visualising deep convolution networks for\ncomputer vision, we present a novel visualisation technique for our document\nnetworks which not only provides insight into their learning process, but also\ncan be interpreted to produce a compelling automatic summarisation system for\ntexts.", "published": "2014-06-15 17:15:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3830v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Human language reveals a universal positivity bias", "abstract": "Using human evaluation of 100,000 words spread across 24 corpora in 10\nlanguages diverse in origin and culture, we present evidence of a deep imprint\nof human sociality in language, observing that (1) the words of natural human\nlanguage possess a universal positivity bias; (2) the estimated emotional\ncontent of words is consistent between languages under translation; and (3)\nthis positivity bias is strongly independent of frequency of word usage.\nAlongside these general regularities, we describe inter-language variations in\nthe emotional spectrum of languages which allow us to rank corpora. We also\nshow how our word evaluations can be used to construct physical-like\ninstruments for both real-time and offline measurement of the emotional content\nof large-scale texts.", "published": "2014-06-15 19:38:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3855v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
