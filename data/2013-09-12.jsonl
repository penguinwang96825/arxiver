{"title": "Mapping Mutable Genres in Structurally Complex Volumes", "abstract": "To mine large digital libraries in humanistically meaningful ways, scholars\nneed to divide them by genre. This is a task that classification algorithms are\nwell suited to assist, but they need adjustment to address the specific\nchallenges of this domain. Digital libraries pose two problems of scale not\nusually found in the article datasets used to test these algorithms. 1) Because\nlibraries span several centuries, the genres being identified may change\ngradually across the time axis. 2) Because volumes are much longer than\narticles, they tend to be internally heterogeneous, and the classification task\nneeds to begin with segmentation. We describe a multi-layered solution that\ntrains hidden Markov models to segment volumes, and uses ensembles of\noverlapping classifiers to address historical change. We test this approach on\na collection of 469,200 volumes drawn from HathiTrust Digital Library. To\ndemonstrate the humanistic value of these methods, we extract 32,209 volumes of\nfiction from the digital library, and trace the changing proportions of first-\nand third-person narration in the corpus. We note that narrative points of view\nseem to have strong associations with particular themes and genres.", "published": "2013-09-12 22:27:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3323v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
