In the present work, we establish how and when\nhallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept\nrepresentations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with\nexperimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic\nexperiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer\nmodel grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured.

This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to\naccurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.\nOur model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,\nand two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant\nresponses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,\ndocument plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,\nmedium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures.

In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven\ntable reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool\ninvocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox\nenvironment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)\nexhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt\nstrategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning\nparadigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised\nfine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool\nusage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize\nmulti-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy\nOptimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality\ntrajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of\nlow-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and\nmore accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks\ndemonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to\ncompetitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy\nand computational precision.", "published": "2025-09-08 02:00:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06278v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

These datasets are synthesized\nusing emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on\nsurrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and\nvehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations\ncorresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,\nthe synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering\nstrong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on\ntasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance\nsegmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through\nstatistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further\ndemonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on\nsynthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity\nscores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on\nreal data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing\nbenchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity.

{"title": "Evolving from Unknown to Known: Retentive Angular Representation Learning for Incremental Open Set Recognition", "abstract": "Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static\nscenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones\nwithin fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should\nincrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data\nstreams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the\ndiscriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to\nrestricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class\nconfusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation\nlearning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown\nrepresentations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an\nangular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating\nexcessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt\na virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known\nrepresentations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through\nboundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification\nstrategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation\nbias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and\npositive/negative class samples.

With consistent experience, learners\ncreate a \"compressed\" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal)\nwhich is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon\nreceiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting\nlearning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent\nwith our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically\nimpaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space\nstructure allows for compression.

Results: The model\nachieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,\nwhere predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both\nreconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related\nfeatures (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned\nwith model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were\nless strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline\nfeatures, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised\ndecompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates\nthat supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while\npartially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,\nmulti-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling\nphysiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as\nECG.

We test 13 commercially available\nLMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people\nin stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical\nprofessions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965\nresulting images for gender representation.

Thus, if\nfault-tolerant quantum computers could efficiently solve such nonlinear\nproblems, it would be a transformative change for many industries. In a recent\nbreakthrough [Liu et al., PNAS 2021], the first efficient quantum algorithm for\nsolving nonlinear differential equations was constructed, based on a single\ncondition $R<1$, where $R$ characterizes the ratio of nonlinearity to\ndissipation. This result, however, is limited to the class of purely\ndissipative systems with negative log-norm, which excludes application to many\nimportant problems. In this work, we correct technical issues with this and\nother prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of\nways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems\nto a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic\nLyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent\n$R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme. Secondly, we\nextend our stable system results to physically relevant settings where\nconserved polynomial quantities exist. Finally, we provide extensive results\nfor the class of non-resonant systems. With this, we are able to show that\nefficient quantum algorithms exist for a much wider class of nonlinear systems\nthan previously known, and prove the BQP-completeness of nonlinear oscillator\nproblems of exponential size.
