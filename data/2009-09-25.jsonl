{"title": "On graphs without a C4 or a diamond", "abstract": "We consider the class of (C4, diamond)-free graphs; graphs in this class do not contain a C4 or a diamond as an induced subgraph. We provide an efficient recognition algorithm for this class. We count the number of maximal cliques in a (C4, diamond)-free graph and the number of n-vertex, labeled (C4, diamond)-free graphs. We also give an efficient algorithm for finding a largest clique in the more general class of (house, diamond)-free graphs.", "published": "2009-09-25 15:14:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4719v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
