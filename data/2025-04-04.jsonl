{"title": "Constant Rate Isometric Embeddings of Hamming Metric into Edit Metric", "abstract": "A function $\\varphi: \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^N$ is called an isometric\nembedding of the $n$-dimensional Hamming metric space to the $N$-dimensional\nedit metric space if, for all $x, y \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$, the Hamming distance\nbetween $x$ and $y$ is equal to the edit distance between $\\varphi(x)$ and\n$\\varphi(y)$. The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio $n/N$. It\nis well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a\nrate of $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\log n})$. However, achieving even near-isometric\nembeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.\n  In this paper, we present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by\ndiscovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the\ncontext of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]). At a\ntechnical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric\nembeddings using a novel object called misaligners. As an immediate consequence\nof our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower\nbounds for various optimization problems in the edit metric, but now with\noptimal dependency on the dimension.\n  We complement our results by showing that no isometric embedding\n$\\varphi:\\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\{0, 1\\}^N$ can have rate greater than 15/32 for all\npositive integers $n$. En route to proving this upper bound, we uncover\nfundamental structural properties necessary for every Hamming-to-edit isometric\nembedding. We also prove similar upper and lower bounds for embeddings over\nlarger alphabets.\n  Finally, we consider embeddings $\\varphi:\\Sigma_{\\text{in}}^n\\to\n\\Sigma_{\\text{out}}^N$ between different input and output alphabets, where the\nrate is given by\n$\\frac{n\\log|\\Sigma_{\\text{in}}|}{N\\log|\\Sigma_{\\text{out}}|}$. In this\nsetting, we show that the rate can be made arbitrarily close to 1.", "published": "2025-04-04 17:21:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03605v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CC", "cs.DS", "cs.IT", "math.CO", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}

Recently, agents powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have been shown to emulate human-like behavior in social\nsettings.

In this work, we combine QD\noptimization with LLM-powered agents to iteratively search for prompts that\ngenerate diverse team behavior in a long-horizon, multi-step collaborative\nenvironment. We first show, through a human-subjects experiment (n=54\nparticipants), that humans exhibit diverse coordination and communication\nbehavior in this domain.
