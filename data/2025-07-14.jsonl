This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and\nthen predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively\npreserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by\nhigh-resolution data.

{"title": "Non-parametric Graph Convolution for Re-ranking in Recommendation Systems", "abstract": "Graph knowledge has been proven effective in enhancing item rankings in\nrecommender systems (RecSys), particularly during the retrieval stage. However,\nits application in the ranking stage, especially when richer contextual\ninformation in user-item interactions is available, remains underexplored. A\nmajor challenge lies in the substantial computational cost associated with\nrepeatedly retrieving neighborhood information from billions of items stored in\ndistributed systems. This resource-intensive requirement makes it difficult to\nscale graph-based methods in practical RecSys. To bridge this gap, we first\ndemonstrate that incorporating graphs in the ranking stage improves ranking\nqualities. Notably, while the improvement is evident, we show that the\nsubstantial computational overheads entailed by graphs are prohibitively\nexpensive for real-world recommendations. In light of this, we propose a\nnon-parametric strategy that utilizes graph convolution for re-ranking only\nduring test time. Our strategy circumvents the notorious computational\noverheads from graph convolution during training, and utilizes structural\nknowledge hidden in graphs on-the-fly during testing. It can be used as a\nplug-and-play module and easily employed to enhance the ranking ability of\nvarious ranking layers of a real-world RecSys with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead. Through comprehensive experiments across four benchmark\ndatasets with varying levels of sparsity, we demonstrate that our strategy\nyields noticeable improvements (i.e., 8.1% on average) during testing time with\nlittle to no additional computational overheads (i.e., 0.5 on average).

To\naddress these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user\nquery through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to\nbridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early\nmethods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from\ntoken co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or\npurchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically\ntransformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are\nbeing used for query reformulation task.

{"title": "Multi-residual Mixture of Experts Learning for Cooperative Control in Multi-vehicle Systems", "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their\napplications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as\nmobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts\nwith traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is\nreferred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective\nLagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic\nscenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are\nhighly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such\ndiverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint\ncomplexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among\nparticipants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict\nphysical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce\nMulti-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for\nLagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with\na learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic\nscenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement\nlearning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a\nresidual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable\nnominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic\nscenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case\nstudy in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas\nFort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.\nThe results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving\nan additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the\nstrongest baseline in each setting.", "published": "2025-07-14 00:17:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09836v1", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.MA", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}

Existing\nASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with\nconsiderable computational cost and memory demands. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework\nthat operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to\nmaximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a\nnetwork trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on\nlocal image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of\ninterpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are\nemployed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight\nand fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality.\nExperimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT\nconsistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency\ncompared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising\nsolution for resource-constrained applications.", "published": "2025-07-14 05:02:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09923v2", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}

When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68\nparticipants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily\ntoothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points\npreceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to\nintervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can\nadvance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive,\nhabitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.", "published": "2025-07-14 20:51:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10798v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for\nparsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much\nWestern music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric\norganisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing\nalgorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and\nphrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and\nethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced\nmethod of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an\nexisting tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we\ngenerate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the\noriginal tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener.\nAdditionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different\nrepresentation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The\noverarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable\nvariations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical\nmusic, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.", "published": "2025-07-14 18:21:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10708v1", "categories": ["cs.NE", "cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.NE"}
{"title": "Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data", "abstract": "In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion\ndetection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and\nIIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled\ncyber-attack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions.\nThis data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the\neffective training of machine learning models. Moreover, rapid detection of\nattacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent\nlarge-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time\nintrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning\nframework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages\nabundant unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and attack behaviors\neffectively. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15,\nBoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20 percent, 1.28 percent, and 8 percent\nof labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions.\nExperimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive\nlearning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection\naccuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model\ncomplex relationships and its learnable activation functions are also explored\nand visualized, offering interpretability and potential for rule extraction.\nThe method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in\nsafety-critical environments where reliability is paramount.", "published": "2025-07-14 21:02:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808v1", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.SY", "eess.SP", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}

Robust Minimum\nRedundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this\nredundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of\nsensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,\nwith prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten\nsensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for\narray sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive\nsearch algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating\nthe search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was\nvalidated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,\nconfirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable\nto failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal\nconfigurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the\npotential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given\nsufficient computational resources.

{"title": "From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents", "abstract": "The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,\ndocument-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'\nbehalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become\nmore capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem.

{"title": "NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting", "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet\nconventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their\norigin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy\nobservations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they\ncorrespond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can\nbe viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a\nshared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as\nlearning the transition from the historical function family to the future\nfunction family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we\nleverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships\nbetween their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the\ntransition path in function space from the historical function family to the\nfuture function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a\nnovel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for\nlearning path of measure between historical and future function families. By\nparameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function\nspaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies\nat discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.\nExperiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior\naccuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family\nperspective.", "published": "2025-07-14 03:48:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09888v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

When the\nchannel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler\nspread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS\ncarrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to\npredict the effective channel at all other carriers. The image of the\nscattering environment changes slowly, making it possible to employ precoding\nat the transmitter. Precoding techniques were developed more than thirty years\nago for wireline modem channels (V.34 standard) defined by linear convolution\nwhere a pulse in the time domain (TD) is used to probe the one-dimensional\npartial response channel. The action of a doubly spread channel on Zak-OTFS\nmodulation determines a two-dimensional partial response channel defined by\ntwisted convolution, and we develop a novel precoding technique for this\nchannel. The proposed precoder leads to separate equalization of each DD\ncarrier which has significantly lower complexity than joint equalization of all\ncarriers. Further, the effective precoded channel results in non-interfering DD\ncarriers which significantly reduces the overhead of guard carriers separating\ndata and pilot carriers, which improves the spectral efficiency significantly.", "published": "2025-07-14 03:58:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09894v2", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
