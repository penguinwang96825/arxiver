{"title": "Scalable Topical Phrase Mining from Text Corpora", "abstract": "While most topic modeling algorithms model text corpora with unigrams, human\ninterpretation often relies on inherent grouping of terms into phrases. As\nsuch, we consider the problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths.\nExisting work either performs post processing to the inference results of\nunigram-based topic models, or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models.\nThese methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases or suffer from poor\nscalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a different approach\nthat is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a\nnovel phrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word\nphrases, and a new topic model that operates on the induced document partition.\nOur approach discovers high quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost\nto the bag-of-words topic model in a variety of datasets including research\npublication titles, abstracts, reviews, and news articles.", "published": "2014-06-24 17:10:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6312v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
