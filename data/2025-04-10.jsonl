{"title": "Specialized text classification: an approach to classifying Open Banking transactions", "abstract": "With the introduction of the PSD2 regulation in the EU which established the\nOpen Banking framework, a new window of opportunities has opened for banks and\nfintechs to explore and enrich Bank transaction descriptions with the aim of\nbuilding a better understanding of customer behavior, while using this\nunderstanding to prevent fraud, reduce risks and offer more competitive and\ntailored services.\n  And although the usage of natural language processing models and techniques\nhas seen an incredible progress in various applications and domains over the\npast few years, custom applications based on domain-specific text corpus remain\nunaddressed especially in the banking sector.\n  In this paper, we introduce a language-based Open Banking transaction\nclassification system with a focus on the french market and french language\ntext. The system encompasses data collection, labeling, preprocessing,\nmodeling, and evaluation stages. Unlike previous studies that focus on general\nclassification approaches, this system is specifically tailored to address the\nchallenges posed by training a language model with a specialized text corpus\n(Banking data in the French context). By incorporating language-specific\ntechniques and domain knowledge, the proposed system demonstrates enhanced\nperformance and efficiency compared to generic approaches.", "published": "2025-04-10 17:14:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12319v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Optimal Investment in Equity and Credit Default Swaps in the Presence of Default", "abstract": "We consider an equity market subject to risk from both unhedgeable shocks and\ndefault. The novelty of our work is that to partially offset default risk,\ninvestors may dynamically trade in a credit default swap (CDS) market. Assuming\ninvestment opportunities are driven by functions of an underlying diffusive\nfactor process, we identify the certainty equivalent for a constant absolute\nrisk aversion investor with a semi-linear partial differential equation (PDE)\nwhich has quadratic growth in both the function and gradient coefficients. For\ngeneral model specifications, we prove existence of a solution to the PDE which\nis also the certainty equivalent. We show the optimal policy in the CDS market\ncovers not only equity losses upon default (as one would expect), but also\nlosses due to restricted future trading opportunities. We use our results to\nprice default dependent claims though the principal of utility indifference,\nand we show that provided the underlying equity market is complete absent the\npossibility of default, the equity-CDS market is complete accounting for\ndefault. Lastly, through a numerical application, we show the optimal CDS\npolicies are essentially static (and hence easily implementable) and that\ninvesting in CDS dramatically increases investor indirect utility.", "published": "2025-04-10 19:30:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08085v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.RM", "91G10 (primary) 91G20, 92G40 (secondary)"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Trading Graph Neural Network", "abstract": "This paper proposes a new algorithm -- Trading Graph Neural Network (TGNN)\nthat can structurally estimate the impact of asset features, dealer features\nand relationship features on asset prices in trading networks. It combines the\nstrength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent\nmachine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms\nexisting reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction\naccuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for\nheterogeneity among both traders and assets.", "published": "2025-04-10 17:40:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07923v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
