The data for the study comes from Russian National Corpus (Russian). The\ntheoretical framework consists of Paul F. Lazarsfeld`s Theory of Sociological\nResearch Methodology and the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). Quantitative\nanalysis shows features in the representation of altruism in Russian that\nsociologists need to know in the preparation of questionnaires, interview\nguides and analysis of transcripts.", "published": "2015-03-04 09:27:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01258v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "All Who Wander: On the Prevalence and Characteristics of Multi-community\n  Engagement", "abstract": "Although analyzing user behavior within individual communities is an active\nand rich research domain, people usually interact with multiple communities\nboth on- and off-line. How do users act in such multi-community environments?\nAlthough there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has\nreceived much less attention in the research community in comparison to the\nintra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of\nmulti-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the\nlanguage that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users\nreceive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source,\nand DBLP for auxiliary experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of\nfeatures drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of\nactivity.\n  One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the \"settling-down\" process\nin real life: an initial exploration of sub-communities before settling down\ninto a few niches. However, we find that the users in our data continually post\nin new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly\namong a more diverse set of smaller communities. Interestingly, it seems that\nusers that eventually leave the community are \"destined\" to do so from the very\nbeginning, in the sense of showing significantly different \"wandering\" patterns\nvery early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important\ndesign implications for community maintainers. Our multi-community perspective\nalso allows us to investigate the \"situation vs. personality\" debate from\nlanguage usage across different communities.", "published": "2015-03-04 01:05:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01180v2", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph", "J.4; H.2.8"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Statistical modality tagging from rule-based annotations and\n  crowdsourcing", "abstract": "We explore training an automatic modality tagger. Modality is the attitude\nthat a speaker might have toward an event or state. One of the main hurdles for\ntraining a linguistic tagger is gathering training data. This is particularly\nproblematic for training a tagger for modality because modality triggers are\nsparse for the overwhelming majority of sentences. We investigate an approach\nto automatically training a modality tagger where we first gathered sentences\nbased on a high-recall simple rule-based modality tagger and then provided\nthese sentences to Mechanical Turk annotators for further annotation. We used\nthe resulting set of training data to train a precise modality tagger using a\nmulti-class SVM that delivers good performance.", "published": "2015-03-04 01:34:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01190v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Bethe Projections for Non-Local Inference", "abstract": "Many inference problems in structured prediction are naturally solved by\naugmenting a tractable dependency structure with complex, non-local auxiliary\nobjectives. This includes the mean field family of variational inference\nalgorithms, soft- or hard-constrained inference using Lagrangian relaxation or\nlinear programming, collective graphical models, and forms of semi-supervised\nlearning such as posterior regularization. We present a method to\ndiscriminatively learn broad families of inference objectives, capturing\npowerful non-local statistics of the latent variables, while maintaining\ntractable and provably fast inference using non-Euclidean projected gradient\ndescent with a distance-generating function given by the Bethe entropy. We\ndemonstrate the performance and flexibility of our method by (1) extracting\nstructured citations from research papers by learning soft global constraints,\n(2) achieving state-of-the-art results on a widely-used handwriting recognition\ntask using a novel learned non-convex inference procedure, and (3) providing a\nfast and highly scalable algorithm for the challenging problem of inference in\na collective graphical model applied to bird migration.", "published": "2015-03-04 17:36:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01397v3", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
