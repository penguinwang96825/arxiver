{"title": "Statistical sentiment analysis performance in Opinum", "abstract": "The classification of opinion texts in positive and negative is becoming a\nsubject of great interest in sentiment analysis. The existence of many labeled\nopinions motivates the use of statistical and machine-learning methods.\nFirst-order statistics have proven to be very limited in this field. The Opinum\napproach is based on the order of the words without using any syntactic and\nsemantic information. It consists of building one probabilistic model for the\npositive and another one for the negative opinions. Then the test opinions are\ncompared to both models and a decision and confidence measure are calculated.\nIn order to reduce the complexity of the training corpus we first lemmatize the\ntexts and we replace most named-entities with wildcards. Opinum presents an\naccuracy above 81% for Spanish opinions in the financial products domain. In\nthis work we discuss which are the most important factors that have impact on\nthe classification performance.", "published": "2013-03-03 01:38:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0446v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Detecting and resolving spatial ambiguity in text using named entity\n  extraction and self learning fuzzy logic techniques", "abstract": "Information extraction identifies useful and relevant text in a document and\nconverts unstructured text into a form that can be loaded into a database\ntable. Named entity extraction is a main task in the process of information\nextraction and is a classification problem in which words are assigned to one\nor more semantic classes or to a default non-entity class. A word which can\nbelong to one or more classes and which has a level of uncertainty in it can be\nbest handled by a self learning Fuzzy Logic Technique. This paper proposes a\nmethod for detecting the presence of spatial uncertainty in the text and\ndealing with spatial ambiguity using named entity extraction techniques coupled\nwith self learning fuzzy logic techniques", "published": "2013-03-03 01:21:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0445v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "A Semantic approach for effective document clustering using WordNet", "abstract": "Now a days, the text document is spontaneously increasing over the internet,\ne-mail and web pages and they are stored in the electronic database format. To\narrange and browse the document it becomes difficult. To overcome such problem\nthe document preprocessing, term selection, attribute reduction and maintaining\nthe relationship between the important terms using background knowledge,\nWordNet, becomes an important parameters in data mining. In these paper the\ndifferent stages are formed, firstly the document preprocessing is done by\nremoving stop words, stemming is performed using porter stemmer algorithm, word\nnet thesaurus is applied for maintaining relationship between the important\nterms, global unique words, and frequent word sets get generated, Secondly,\ndata matrix is formed, and thirdly terms are extracted from the documents by\nusing term selection approaches tf-idf, tf-df, and tf2 based on their minimum\nthreshold value. Further each and every document terms gets preprocessed, where\nthe frequency of each term within the document is counted for representation.\nThe purpose of this approach is to reduce the attributes and find the effective\nterm selection method using WordNet for better clustering accuracy. Experiments\nare evaluated on Reuters Transcription Subsets, wheat, trade, money grain, and\nship, Reuters 21578, Classic 30, 20 News group (atheism), 20 News group\n(Hardware), 20 News group (Computer Graphics) etc.", "published": "2013-03-03 12:19:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0489v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
