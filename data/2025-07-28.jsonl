Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction\nloss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise\napproach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to\njittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we\npropose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the\ninfluence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme\ncoarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based\non their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually\nconsistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the\nconventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics\nand visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling\nphonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D\nfacial animation.

To\naddress this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal\nModel Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality\nrooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to\ndistinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the\nneed for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA.

Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired.

To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments.

{"title": "Hyperbolic Embeddings for Order-Aware Classification of Audio Effect Chains", "abstract": "Audio effects (AFXs) are essential tools in music production, frequently\napplied in chains to shape timbre and dynamics. The order of AFXs in a chain\nplays a crucial role in determining the final sound, particularly when\nnon-linear (e.g., distortion) or time-variant (e.g., chorus) processors are\ninvolved. Despite its importance, most AFX-related studies have primarily\nfocused on estimating effect types and their parameters from a wet signal. To\naddress this gap, we formulate AFX chain recognition as the task of jointly\nestimating AFX types and their order from a wet signal. We propose a\nneural-network-based method that embeds wet signals into a hyperbolic space and\nclassifies their AFX chains. Hyperbolic space can represent tree-structured\ndata more efficiently than Euclidean space due to its exponential expansion\nproperty. Since AFX chains can be represented as trees, with AFXs as nodes and\nedges encoding effect order, hyperbolic space is well-suited for modeling the\nexponentially growing and non-commutative nature of ordered AFX combinations,\nwhere changes in effect order can result in different final sounds. Experiments\nusing guitar sounds demonstrate that, with an appropriate curvature, the\nproposed method outperforms its Euclidean counterpart. Further analysis based\non AFX type and chain length highlights the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in capturing AFX order.", "published": "2025-07-28 08:38:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20624v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB", "abstract": "Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA)\nis studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA\nsignificantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA\nestimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the\nconventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a\nnew multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In\nparticular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to\nfacilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the\nMUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature,\neffectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed\nfor both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is\ntheoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation\naccuracy compared to traditional SPDAs.
