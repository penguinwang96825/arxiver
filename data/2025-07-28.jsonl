Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction\nloss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise\napproach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to\njittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we\npropose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the\ninfluence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme\ncoarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based\non their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually\nconsistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the\nconventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics\nand visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling\nphonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D\nfacial animation.

To\naddress this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal\nModel Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality\nrooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to\ndistinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the\nneed for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA.

Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired.
