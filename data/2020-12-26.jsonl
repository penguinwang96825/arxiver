{"title": "Smartajweed Automatic Recognition of Arabic Quranic Recitation Rules", "abstract": "Tajweed is a set of rules to read the Quran in a correct Pronunciation of the\nletters with all its Qualities, while Reciting the Quran. which means you have\nto give every letter in the Quran its due of characteristics and apply it to\nthis particular letter in this specific situation while reading, which may\ndiffer in other times. These characteristics include melodic rules, like where\nto stop and for how long, when to merge two letters in pronunciation or when to\nstretch some, or even when to put more strength on some letters over other.\nMost of the papers focus mainly on the main recitation rules and the\npronunciation but not (Ahkam AL Tajweed) which give different rhythm and\ndifferent melody to the pronunciation with every different rule of (Tajweed).\nWhich is also considered very important and essential in Reading the Quran as\nit can give different meanings to the words. In this paper we discuss in detail\nfull system for automatic recognition of Quran Recitation Rules (Tajweed) by\nusing support vector machine and threshold scoring system", "published": "2020-12-26 11:24:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04200v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Social media data reveals signal for public consumer perceptions", "abstract": "Researchers have used social media data to estimate various macroeconomic\nindicators about public behaviors, mostly as a way to reduce surveying costs.\nOne of the most widely cited economic indicator is consumer confidence index\n(CCI). Numerous studies in the past have focused on using social media,\nespecially Twitter data, to predict CCI. However, the strong correlations\ndisappeared when those models were tested with newer data according to a recent\ncomprehensive survey. In this work, we revisit this problem of assessing the\ntrue potential of using social media data to measure CCI, by proposing a robust\nnon-parametric Bayesian modeling framework grounded in Gaussian Process\nRegression (which provides both an estimate and an uncertainty associated with\nit). Integral to our framework is a principled experimentation methodology that\ndemonstrates how digital data can be employed to reduce the frequency of\nsurveys, and thus periodic polling would be needed only to calibrate our model.\nVia extensive experimentation we show how the choice of different\nmicro-decisions, such as the smoothing interval, various types of lags etc.\nhave an important bearing on the results. By using decadal data (2008-2019)\nfrom Reddit, we show that both monthly and daily estimates of CCI can, indeed,\nbe reliably estimated at least several months in advance, and that our model\nestimates are far superior to those generated by the existing methods.", "published": "2020-12-26 03:58:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13675v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Spatial Reasoning from Natural Language Instructions for Robot\n  Manipulation", "abstract": "Robots that can manipulate objects in unstructured environments and\ncollaborate with humans can benefit immensely by understanding natural\nlanguage. We propose a pipelined architecture of two stages to perform spatial\nreasoning on the text input. All the objects in the scene are first localized,\nand then the instruction for the robot in natural language and the localized\nco-ordinates are mapped to the start and end co-ordinates corresponding to the\nlocations where the robot must pick up and place the object respectively. We\nshow that representing the localized objects by quantizing their positions to a\nbinary grid is preferable to representing them as a list of 2D co-ordinates. We\nalso show that attention improves generalization and can overcome biases in the\ndataset. The proposed method is used to pick-and-place playing cards using a\nrobot arm.", "published": "2020-12-26 07:53:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13693v2", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
{"title": "Translating Natural Language Instructions to Computer Programs for Robot\n  Manipulation", "abstract": "It is highly desirable for robots that work alongside humans to be able to\nunderstand instructions in natural language. Existing language conditioned\nimitation learning models directly predict the actuator commands from the image\nobservation and the instruction text. Rather than directly predicting actuator\ncommands, we propose translating the natural language instruction to a Python\nfunction which queries the scene by accessing the output of the object detector\nand controls the robot to perform the specified task. This enables the use of\nnon-differentiable modules such as a constraint solver when computing commands\nto the robot. Moreover, the labels in this setup are significantly more\ninformative computer programs that capture the intent of the expert rather than\nteleoperated demonstrations. We show that the proposed method performs better\nthan training a neural network to directly predict the robot actions.", "published": "2020-12-26 07:57:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13695v2", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
