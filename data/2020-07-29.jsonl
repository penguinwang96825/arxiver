{"title": "Book Embeddings of Graph Products", "abstract": "A $k$-stack layout (also called a $k$-page book embedding) of a graph consists of a total order of the vertices, and a partition of the edges into $k$ sets of non-crossing edges with respect to the vertex order. The stack number (book thickness, page number) of a graph is the minimum $k$ such that it admits a $k$-stack layout. A $k$-queue layout is defined similarly, except that no two edges in a single set may be nested.\n  It was recently proved that graphs of various non-minor-closed classes are subgraphs of the strong product of a path and a graph with bounded treewidth. Motivated by this decomposition result, we explore stack layouts of graph products. We show that the stack number is bounded for the strong product of a path and (i) a graph of bounded pathwidth or (ii) a bipartite graph of bounded treewidth and bounded degree. The results are obtained via a novel concept of simultaneous stack-queue layouts, which may be of independent interest.", "published": "2020-07-29 20:48:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15102v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.DS", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "A Hybrid Adaptive Educational eLearning Project based on Ontologies Matching and Recommendation System", "abstract": "The implementation of teaching interventions in learning needs has received considerable attention, as the provision of the same educational conditions to all students, is pedagogically ineffective. In contrast, more effectively considered the pedagogical strategies that adapt to the real individual skills of the students. An important innovation in this direction is the Adaptive Educational Systems (AES) that support automatic modeling study and adjust the teaching content on educational needs and students' skills. Effective utilization of these educational approaches can be enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in order to the substantive content of the web acquires structure and the published information is perceived by the search engines. This study proposes a novel Adaptive Educational eLearning System (AEeLS) that has the capacity to gather and analyze data from learning repositories and to adapt these to the educational curriculum according to the student skills and experience. It is a novel hybrid machine learning system that combines a Semi-Supervised Classification method for ontology matching and a Recommendation Mechanism that uses a hybrid method from neighborhood-based collaborative and content-based filtering techniques, in order to provide a personalized educational environment for each student.", "published": "2020-07-29 12:13:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14771v3", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.DL", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Editorial: Understanding Cryptocurrencies", "abstract": "Cryptocurrency refers to a type of digital asset that uses distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology to enable a secure transaction. Although the technology is widely misunderstood, many central banks are considering launching their own national cryptocurrency. In contrast to most data in financial economics, detailed data on the history of every transaction in the cryptocurrency complex are freely available. Furthermore, empirically-oriented research is only now beginning, presenting an extraordinary research opportunity for academia. We provide some insights into the mechanics of cryptocurrencies, describing summary statistics and focusing on potential future research avenues in financial economics.", "published": "2020-07-29 09:30:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14702v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
