{"title": "Corpus-based Web Document Summarization using Statistical and Linguistic\n  Approach", "abstract": "Single document summarization generates summary by extracting the\nrepresentative sentences from the document. In this paper, we presented a novel\ntechnique for summarization of domain-specific text from a single web document\nthat uses statistical and linguistic analysis on the text in a reference corpus\nand the web document. The proposed summarizer uses the combinational function\nof Sentence Weight (SW) and Subject Weight (SuW) to determine the rank of a\nsentence, where SW is the function of number of terms (t_n) and number of words\n(w_n) in a sentence, and term frequency (t_f) in the corpus and SuW is the\nfunction of t_n and w_n in a subject, and t_f in the corpus. 30 percent of the\nranked sentences are considered to be the summary of the web document. We\ngenerated three web document summaries using our technique and compared each of\nthem with the summaries developed manually from 16 different human subjects.\nResults showed that 68 percent of the summaries produced by our approach\nsatisfy the manual summaries.", "published": "2013-04-09 07:30:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2476v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
