As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model.

This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary\nresuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with\nvigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR\napp on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth\nand rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,\nbleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation\nand questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events.

In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple\ncomponents across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.\nThey serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing\nconfigurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like\ndocumentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary\nstudy on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our\nstudy revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over\nthe past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these\ndependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay\nof 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation.

As a more\nfeasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback\nhas shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video\nusually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents.

{"title": "LAG: Logic-Augmented Generation from a Cartesian Perspective", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\na wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring\nspecialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates\nthis by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning\nscenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of\nstructured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from\n\\textit{Discours de la m\\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented\nGeneration (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through\nsystematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,\nLAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by\nlogical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers\nto guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise\ngrounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG\nsignificantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns\nLLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to\nexisting RAG systems.", "published": "2025-08-07 15:42:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05509v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "On the Reliability of Sampling Strategies in Offline Recommender Evaluation", "abstract": "Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems\nwhen online testing is impractical or risky.

While prior work has\nproposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on\nfixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model\ncomparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user\npreferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of\nlogging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.\nUsing a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate\ndiverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling\nstrategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model\nseparability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability\nunder exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth).

Distinctly, communities are constituted by\nindividuals, who present high dynamicity and relate to rich structural patterns\nin social networks. To our knowledge, limited research has been devoted to\ncomprehensively exploiting this information for recommending communities.\n  To bridge this gap, this paper presents CASO, a novel and effective model\nspecially designed for social community recommendation.
