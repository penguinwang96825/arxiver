{"title": "Better Document-level Sentiment Analysis from RST Discourse Parsing", "abstract": "Discourse structure is the hidden link between surface features and\ndocument-level properties, such as sentiment polarity. We show that the\ndiscourse analyses produced by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsers can\nimprove document-level sentiment analysis, via composition of local information\nup the discourse tree. First, we show that reweighting discourse units\naccording to their position in a dependency representation of the rhetorical\nstructure can yield substantial improvements on lexicon-based sentiment\nanalysis. Next, we present a recursive neural network over the RST structure,\nwhich offers significant improvements over classification-based methods.", "published": "2015-09-04 20:28:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01599v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification", "abstract": "This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level\nconvolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed\nseveral large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional\nnetworks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are\noffered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their\nTFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and\nrecurrent neural networks.", "published": "2015-09-04 22:31:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
