{"title": "Population size predicts lexical diversity, but so does the mean sea\n  level - why it is important to correctly account for the structure of\n  temporal data", "abstract": "In order to demonstrate why it is important to correctly account for the\n(serial dependent) structure of temporal data, we document an apparently\nspectacular relationship between population size and lexical diversity: for\nfive out of seven investigated languages, there is a strong relationship\nbetween population size and lexical diversity of the primary language in this\ncountry. We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model\nthat does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar\nbut nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and\nlexical diversity. Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were\npublished that present surprising links between different economic, cultural,\npolitical and (socio-)demographical variables on the one hand and cultural or\nlinguistic characteristics on the other hand, but seem to suffer from exactly\nthis problem, we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has\nprofound consequences. We demonstrate how simple transformation of the time\nseries can often solve problems of this type and argue that the evaluation of\nthe plausibility of a relationship is important in this context. We hope that\nour paper will help both researchers and reviewers to understand why it is\nimportant to use special models for the analysis of data with a natural\ntemporal ordering.", "published": "2015-11-06 09:39:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02014v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Approach for Improving Instructions", "abstract": "A new approach called SKYSET (Synthetic Knowledge Yield Social Entities\nTranslation) is proposed to validate completeness and to reduce ambiguity from\nwritten instructional documentation. SKYSET utilizes a quintuple set of\nstandardized categories, which differs from traditional approaches that\ntypically use triples. The SKYSET System defines the categories required to\nform a standard template for representing information that is portable across\ndifferent domains. It provides a standardized framework that enables sentences\nfrom written instructions to be translated into sets of category typed entities\non a table or database. The SKYSET entities contain conceptual units or phrases\nthat represent information from the original source documentation. SKYSET\nenables information concatenation where multiple documents from different\ndomains can be translated and combined into a single common filterable and\nsearchable table of entities.", "published": "2015-11-06 15:36:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02117v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multi-lingual Geoparsing based on Machine Translation", "abstract": "Our method for multi-lingual geoparsing uses monolingual tools and resources\nalong with machine translation and alignment to return location words in many\nlanguages. Not only does our method save the time and cost of developing\ngeoparsers for each language separately, but also it allows the possibility of\na wide range of language capabilities within a single interface. We evaluated\nour method in our LanguageBridge prototype on location named entities using\nnewswire, broadcast news and telephone conversations in English, Arabic and\nChinese data from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Our results for\ngeoparsing Chinese and Arabic text using our multi-lingual geoparsing method\nare comparable to our results for geoparsing English text with our English\ntools.

{"title": "Towards a Better Understanding of Predict and Count Models", "abstract": "In a recent paper, Levy and Goldberg pointed out an interesting connection\nbetween prediction-based word embedding models and count models based on\npointwise mutual information. Under certain conditions, they showed that both\nmodels end up optimizing equivalent objective functions. This paper explores\nthis connection in more detail and lays out the factors leading to differences\nbetween these models. We find that the most relevant differences from an\noptimization perspective are (i) predict models work in a low dimensional space\nwhere embedding vectors can interact heavily; (ii) since predict models have\nfewer parameters, they are less prone to overfitting.\n  Motivated by the insight of our analysis, we show how count models can be\nregularized in a principled manner and provide closed-form solutions for L1 and\nL2 regularization. Finally, we propose a new embedding model with a convex\nobjective and the additional benefit of being intelligible.", "published": "2015-11-06 10:29:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02024v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
