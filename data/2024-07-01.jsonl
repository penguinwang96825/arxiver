{"title": "Offline Digital Euro: a Minimum Viable CBDC using Groth-Sahai proofs", "abstract": "Current digital payment solutions are fragile and offer less privacy than\ntraditional cash.\n  Their critical dependency on an online service used to perform and validate\ntransactions makes them void if this service is unreachable.\n  Moreover, no transaction can be executed during server malfunctions or power\noutages.\n  Due to climate change, the likelihood of extreme weather increases. As\nextreme weather is a major cause of power outages, the frequency of power\noutages is expected to increase.\n  The lack of privacy is an inherent result of their account-based design or\nthe use of a public ledger.\n  The critical dependency and lack of privacy can be resolved with a Central\nBank Digital Currency that can be used offline.\n  This thesis proposes a design and a first implementation for an offline-first\ndigital euro.\n  The protocol offers complete privacy during transactions using zero-knowledge\nproofs.\n  Furthermore, transactions can be executed offline without third parties and\nretroactive double-spending detection is facilitated.\n  To protect the users' privacy, but also guard against money laundering, we\nhave added the following privacy-guarding mechanism.\n  The bank and trusted third parties for law enforcement must collaborate to\ndecrypt transactions, revealing the digital pseudonym used in the transaction.\n  Importantly, the transaction can be decrypted without decrypting prior\ntransactions attached to the digital euro.\n  The protocol has a working initial implementation showcasing its usability\nand demonstrating functionality.", "published": "2024-07-01 09:55:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13776v1", "categories": ["cs.CR", "q-fin.TR", "68-02"], "primary_category": "cs.CR"}
