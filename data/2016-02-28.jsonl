{"title": "QuotationFinder - Searching for Quotations and Allusions in Greek and\n  Latin Texts and Establishing the Degree to Which a Quotation or Allusion\n  Matches Its Source", "abstract": "The software programs generally used with the TLG (Thesaurus Linguae Graecae)\nand the CLCLT (CETEDOC Library of Christian Latin Texts) CD-ROMs are not well\nsuited for finding quotations and allusions. QuotationFinder uses more\nsophisticated criteria as it ranks search results based on how closely they\nmatch the source text, listing search results with literal quotations first and\nloose verbal parallels last.", "published": "2016-02-28 02:25:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08657v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Identification of Parallel Passages Across a Large Hebrew/Aramaic Corpus", "abstract": "We propose a method for efficiently finding all parallel passages in a large\ncorpus, even if the passages are not quite identical due to rephrasing and\northographic variation. The key ideas are the representation of each word in\nthe corpus by its two most infrequent letters, finding matched pairs of strings\nof four or five words that differ by at most one word and then identifying\nclusters of such matched pairs. Using this method, over 4600 parallel pairs of\npassages were identified in the Babylonian Talmud, a Hebrew-Aramaic corpus of\nover 1.8 million words, in just over 30 seconds. Empirical comparisons on\nsample data indicate that the coverage obtained by our method is essentially\nthe same as that obtained using slow exhaustive methods.", "published": "2016-02-28 13:43:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08715v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Gibberish Semantics: How Good is Russian Twitter in Word Semantic\n  Similarity Task?", "abstract": "The most studied and most successful language models were developed and\nevaluated mainly for English and other close European languages, such as\nFrench, German, etc. It is important to study applicability of these models to\nother languages. The use of vector space models for Russian was recently\nstudied for multiple corpora, such as Wikipedia, RuWac, lib.ru. These models\nwere evaluated against word semantic similarity task. For our knowledge Twitter\nwas not considered as a corpus for this task, with this work we fill the gap.\nResults for vectors trained on Twitter corpus are comparable in accuracy with\nother single-corpus trained models, although the best performance is currently\nachieved by combination of multiple corpora.", "published": "2016-02-28 16:58:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08741v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Optimizing the Learning Order of Chinese Characters Using a Novel\n  Topological Sort Algorithm", "abstract": "We present a novel algorithm for optimizing the order in which Chinese\ncharacters are learned, one that incorporates the benefits of learning them in\norder of usage frequency and in order of their hierarchal structural\nrelationships. We show that our work outperforms previously published orders\nand algorithms. Our algorithm is applicable to any scheduling task where nodes\nhave intrinsic differences in importance and must be visited in topological\norder.", "published": "2016-02-28 16:59:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08742v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Resource Constrained Structured Prediction", "abstract": "We study the problem of structured prediction under test-time budget\nconstraints. We propose a novel approach applicable to a wide range of\nstructured prediction problems in computer vision and natural language\nprocessing. Our approach seeks to adaptively generate computationally costly\nfeatures during test-time in order to reduce the computational cost of\nprediction while maintaining prediction performance. We show that training the\nadaptive feature generation system can be reduced to a series of structured\nlearning problems, resulting in efficient training using existing structured\nlearning algorithms. This framework provides theoretical justification for\nseveral existing heuristic approaches found in literature. We evaluate our\nproposed adaptive system on two structured prediction tasks, optical character\nrecognition (OCR) and dependency parsing and show strong performance in\nreduction of the feature costs without degrading accuracy.", "published": "2016-02-28 19:44:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08761v2", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
