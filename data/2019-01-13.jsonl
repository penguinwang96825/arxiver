{"title": "Passage Re-ranking with BERT", "abstract": "Recently, neural models pretrained on a language modeling task, such as ELMo\n(Peters et al., 2017), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et\nal., 2018), have achieved impressive results on various natural language\nprocessing tasks such as question-answering and natural language inference. In\nthis paper, we describe a simple re-implementation of BERT for query-based\npassage re-ranking. Our system is the state of the art on the TREC-CAR dataset\nand the top entry in the leaderboard of the MS MARCO passage retrieval task,\noutperforming the previous state of the art by 27% (relative) in MRR@10. The\ncode to reproduce our results is available at\nhttps://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4marco-bert", "published": "2019-01-13 23:27:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04085v5", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
