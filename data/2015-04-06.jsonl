{"title": "Bengali to Assamese Statistical Machine Translation using Moses (Corpus\n  Based)", "abstract": "Machine dialect interpretation assumes a real part in encouraging man-machine\ncorrespondence and in addition men-men correspondence in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP). Machine Translation (MT) alludes to utilizing machine to\nchange one dialect to an alternate. Statistical Machine Translation is a type\nof MT consisting of Language Model (LM), Translation Model (TM) and decoder. In\nthis paper, Bengali to Assamese Statistical Machine Translation Model has been\ncreated by utilizing Moses. Other translation tools like IRSTLM for Language\nModel and GIZA-PP-V1.0.7 for Translation model are utilized within this\nframework which is accessible in Linux situations. The purpose of the LM is to\nencourage fluent output and the purpose of TM is to encourage similarity\nbetween input and output, the decoder increases the probability of translated\ntext in target language. A parallel corpus of 17100 sentences in Bengali and\nAssamese has been utilized for preparing within this framework. Measurable MT\nprocedures have not so far been generally investigated for Indian dialects. It\nmight be intriguing to discover to what degree these models can help the\nimmense continuous MT deliberations in the nation.", "published": "2015-04-06 01:18:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01182v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Metric to Classify Style of Spoken Speech", "abstract": "The ability to classify spoken speech based on the style of speaking is an\nimportant problem. With the advent of BPO's in recent times, specifically those\nthat cater to a population other than the local population, it has become\nnecessary for BPO's to identify people with certain style of speaking\n(American, British etc). Today BPO's employ accent analysts to identify people\nhaving the required style of speaking. This process while involving human bias,\nit is becoming increasingly infeasible because of the high attrition rate in\nthe BPO industry. In this paper, we propose a new metric, which robustly and\naccurately helps classify spoken speech based on the style of speaking. The\nrole of the proposed metric is substantiated by using it to classify real\nspeech data collected from over seventy different people working in a BPO. We\ncompare the performance of the metric against human experts who independently\ncarried out the classification process. Experimental results show that the\nperformance of the system using the novel metric performs better than two\ndifferent human expert.", "published": "2015-04-06 22:00:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01427v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Semi-supervised Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Categorization\n  via Region Embedding", "abstract": "This paper presents a new semi-supervised framework with convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for text categorization. Unlike the previous approaches that\nrely on word embeddings, our method learns embeddings of small text regions\nfrom unlabeled data for integration into a supervised CNN. The proposed scheme\nfor embedding learning is based on the idea of two-view semi-supervised\nlearning, which is intended to be useful for the task of interest even though\nthe training is done on unlabeled data. Our models achieve better results than\nprevious approaches on sentiment classification and topic classification tasks.", "published": "2015-04-06 10:42:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01255v3", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "QUOTUS: The Structure of Political Media Coverage as Revealed by Quoting\n  Patterns", "abstract": "Given the extremely large pool of events and stories available, media outlets\nneed to focus on a subset of issues and aspects to convey to their audience.\nOutlets are often accused of exhibiting a systematic bias in this selection\nprocess, with different outlets portraying different versions of reality.\nHowever, in the absence of objective measures and empirical evidence, the\ndirection and extent of systematicity remains widely disputed.\n  In this paper we propose a framework based on quoting patterns for\nquantifying and characterizing the degree to which media outlets exhibit\nsystematic bias. We apply this framework to a massive dataset of news articles\nspanning the six years of Obama's presidency and all of his speeches, and\nreveal that a systematic pattern does indeed emerge from the outlet's quoting\nbehavior. Moreover, we show that this pattern can be successfully exploited in\nan unsupervised prediction setting, to determine which new quotes an outlet\nwill select to broadcast. By encoding bias patterns in a low-rank space we\nprovide an analysis of the structure of political media coverage. This reveals\na latent media bias space that aligns surprisingly well with political ideology\nand outlet type. A linguistic analysis exposes striking differences across\nthese latent dimensions, showing how the different types of media outlets\nportray different realities even when reporting on the same events. For\nexample, outlets mapped to the mainstream conservative side of the latent space\nfocus on quotes that portray a presidential persona disproportionately\ncharacterized by negativity.", "published": "2015-04-06 20:00:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01383v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
