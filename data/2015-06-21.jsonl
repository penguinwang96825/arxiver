{"title": "Extreme Extraction: Only One Hour per Relation", "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) aims to automatically generate a large knowledge\nbase from natural language text, but progress remains slow. Supervised learning\nrequires copious human annotation, while unsupervised and weakly supervised\napproaches do not deliver competitive accuracy. As a result, most fielded\napplications of IE, as well as the leading TAC-KBP systems, rely on significant\namounts of manual engineering. Even \"Extreme\" methods, such as those reported\nin Freedman et al. 2011, require about 10 hours of expert labor per relation.\n  This paper shows how to reduce that effort by an order of magnitude. We\npresent a novel system, InstaRead, that streamlines authoring with an ensemble\nof methods: 1) encoding extraction rules in an expressive and compositional\nrepresentation, 2) guiding the user to promising rules based on corpus\nstatistics and mined resources, and 3) introducing a new interactive\ndevelopment cycle that provides immediate feedback --- even on large datasets.\nExperiments show that experts can create quality extractors in under an hour\nand even NLP novices can author good extractors. These extractors equal or\noutperform ones obtained by comparably supervised and state-of-the-art\ndistantly supervised approaches.", "published": "2015-06-21 22:04:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06418v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR", "H.2.8, H.3.1, I.2.7, I.5.5"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
