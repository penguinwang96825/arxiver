{"title": "An evaluation of keyword extraction from online communication for the\n  characterisation of social relations", "abstract": "The set of interpersonal relationships on a social network service or a\nsimilar online community is usually highly heterogenous. The concept of tie\nstrength captures only one aspect of this heterogeneity. Since the unstructured\ntext content of online communication artefacts is a salient source of\ninformation about a social relationship, we investigate the utility of keywords\nextracted from the message body as a representation of the relationship's\ncharacteristics as reflected by the conversation topics. Keyword extraction is\nperformed using standard natural language processing methods. Communication\ndata and human assessments of the extracted keywords are obtained from Facebook\nusers via a custom application. The overall positive quality assessment\nprovides evidence that the keywords indeed convey relevant information about\nthe relationship.", "published": "2014-02-11 10:27:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2427v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
