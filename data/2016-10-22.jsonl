{"title": "Automatic Identification of Sarcasm Target: An Introductory Approach", "abstract": "Past work in computational sarcasm deals primarily with sarcasm detection. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel, related problem: sarcasm target\nidentification i.e., extracting the target of ridicule in a sarcastic\nsentence). We present an introductory approach for sarcasm target\nidentification. Our approach employs two types of extractors: one based on\nrules, and another consisting of a statistical classifier. To compare our\napproach, we use two baselines: a na\\\"ive baseline and another baseline based\non work in sentiment target identification. We perform our experiments on book\nsnippets and tweets, and show that our hybrid approach performs better than the\ntwo baselines and also, in comparison with using the two extractors\nindividually. Our introductory approach establishes the viability of sarcasm\ntarget identification, and will serve as a baseline for future work.", "published": "2016-10-22 19:50:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07091v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
