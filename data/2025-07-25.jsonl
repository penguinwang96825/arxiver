{"title": "Let It Go? Not Quite: Addressing Item Cold Start in Sequential Recommendations with Content-Based Initialization", "abstract": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure.

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC\nof 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity\nof 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the\nmodel relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,\nvasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was\nintegrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing\nclinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty.

{"title": "Perspective from a Higher Dimension: Can 3D Geometric Priors Help Visual Floorplan Localization?", "abstract": "Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,\nand inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within\nthe floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released\nafter the anonymous review.", "published": "2025-07-25 01:34:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18881v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.RO"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel\nadversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and\nundefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)\nrepresentations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting\npoint clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point\nclouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,\nMAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain\neffective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting\nand prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the\noptimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and\nundefendability.

The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework.

To\nfacilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \\benchmarkname{}, a large-scale\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both\nsingle-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-\nand closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under\nmulti-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while\npreserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external\nadversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any\nadditional supervision.", "published": "2025-07-25 18:11:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19598v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Large Language Models: A Survey", "abstract": "Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large\nlanguage models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of\nself-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context\nmodeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two\nprincipal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention\nmethods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent\nformulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with\nreduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit\nattention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,\nblock-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while\npreserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and\ncomprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic\ninnovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the\nincorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language\nmodels, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and\nhybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning\ntheoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to\nserve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and\nefficient language models.", "published": "2025-07-25 18:08:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19595v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
