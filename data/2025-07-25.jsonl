{"title": "Let It Go? Not Quite: Addressing Item Cold Start in Sequential Recommendations with Content-Based Initialization", "abstract": "Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where\nitems with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due\nto the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage\nitem metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use\nembeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as\ninitialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content\nembeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt\nto the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can\ndegrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far\nfrom their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to\naddress this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or\nfine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen\nembeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting\nthem go too far from their original semantic structure.

Recent advances have\nequipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing\nthem to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by\nthis ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming\nto enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever.

In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel\nregularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in\ngraph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content.

{"title": "Learning Individual Intrinsic Reward in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Incorporating Generalized Human Expertise", "abstract": "Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a\nchallenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in\nenvironments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue\ninvolves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient\nexploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered\nshaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves\nineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex\nproblems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and\npropose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via\nIncorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge\ninto MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid\nunnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and\nhuman expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual\nintrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational\ntransformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action\npreferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nrepresentative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability\nacross different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.", "published": "2025-07-25 00:59:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18867v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Early Mortality Prediction in ICU Patients with Hypertensive Kidney Disease Using Interpretable Machine Learning", "abstract": "Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care\nunits (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools\nare lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC\nof 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity\nof 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the\nmodel relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,\nvasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was\nintegrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing\nclinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:\nWe present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk\nassessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance\nwith uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and\ntransparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical\ndeployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.", "published": "2025-07-25 00:48:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18866v1", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

While\nexisting W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we\nextend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.\nSpecifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate\nactions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we\npropose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so\nthat the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak\nmodels. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,\nwe further construct ``trajectory trees,\" a hierarchical representation that\norganizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,\nwe provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving\nW2SG performance.

The first part reviews recent\nfindings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,\nincluding Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also\nhighlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true\nunderstanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys\nemerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on\nsystem architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such\nas Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of\ntheir design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.\nParticular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,\ncalibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The\nfinal section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box\nsystems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious\ngames-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or\npredictive modeling.

{"title": "Dynamic distributed decision-making for resilient resource reallocation in disrupted manufacturing systems", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic brings many unexpected disruptions, such as frequently\nshifting markets and limited human workforce, to manufacturers. To stay\ncompetitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies\nare needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One\nessential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks,\nespecially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though\nmulti-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and\nagile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource\nuncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based\nresource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and\ndynamic agent decision-making. Based on the RA architecture, a rescheduling\nstrategy that incorporates risk assessment via a clustering agent coordination\nstrategy is also proposed. A simulation-based case study is implemented to\ndemonstrate dynamic rescheduling using the proposed multi-agent framework.
