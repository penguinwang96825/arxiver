{"title": "An Analysis of the Interdependence Between Peanut and Other Agricultural Commodities in China's Futures Market", "abstract": "This study analyzes historical data from five agricultural commodities in the\nChinese futures market to explore the correlation, cointegration, and Granger\ncausality between Peanut futures and related futures. Multivariate linear\nregression models are constructed for prices and logarithmic returns, while\ndynamic relationships are examined using VAR and DCC-EGARCH models. The results\nreveal a significant dynamic linkage between Peanut and Soybean Oil futures\nthrough DCC-EGARCH, whereas the VAR model suggests limited influence from other\nfutures. Additionally, the application of MLP, CNN, and LSTM neural networks\nfor price prediction highlights the critical role of time step configurations\nin forecasting accuracy. These findings provide valuable insights into the\ninterconnectedness of agricultural futures markets and the efficacy of advanced\nmodeling techniques in financial analysis.", "published": "2025-01-28 04:29:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16697v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Trends and Reversion in Financial Markets on Time Scales from Minutes to Decades", "abstract": "We empirically analyze the reversion of financial market trends with time\nhorizons ranging from minutes to decades. The analysis covers equities,\ninterest rates, currencies and commodities and combines 14 years of futures\ntick data, 30 years of daily futures prices, 330 years of monthly asset prices,\nand yearly financial data since medieval times.\n  Across asset classes, we find that markets are in a trending regime on time\nscales that range from a few hours to a few years, while they are in a\nreversion regime on shorter and longer time scales. In the trending regime,\nweak trends tend to persist, which can be explained by herding behavior of\ninvestors. However, in this regime trends tend to revert before they become\nstrong enough to be statistically significant, which can be interpreted as a\nreturn of asset prices to their intrinsic value. In the reversion regime, we\nfind the opposite pattern: weak trends tend to revert, while those trends that\nbecome statistically significant tend to persist.\n  Our results provide a set of empirical tests of theoretical models of\nfinancial markets. We interpret them in the light of a recently proposed\nlattice gas model, where the lattice represents the social network of traders,\nthe gas molecules represent the shares of financial assets, and efficient\nmarkets correspond to the critical point. If this model is accurate, the\nlattice gas must be near this critical point on time scales from 1 hour to a\nfew days, with a correlation time of a few years.", "published": "2025-01-28 07:51:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16772v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Exploratory Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization with Regime-Switching Market Dynamics", "abstract": "Considering the continuous-time Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio optimization\nproblem, we study a regime-switching market setting and apply reinforcement\nlearning (RL) techniques to assist informed exploration within the control\nspace. We introduce and solve the Exploratory Mean Variance with Regime\nSwitching (EMVRS) problem. We also present a Policy Improvement Theorem.\nFurther, we recognize that the widely applied Temporal Difference (TD) learning\nis not adequate for the EMVRS context, hence we consider Orthogonality\nCondition (OC) learning, leveraging the martingale property of the induced\noptimal value function from the analytical solution to EMVRS. We design a RL\nalgorithm that has more meaningful parameterization using the market parameters\nand propose an updating scheme for each parameter. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate the superiority of OC learning over TD learning with a clear\nconvergence of the market parameters towards their corresponding ``grounding\ntrue\" values in a simulated market scenario. In a real market data study, EMVRS\nwith OC learning outperforms its counterparts with the highest mean and\nreasonably low volatility of the annualized portfolio returns.", "published": "2025-01-28 02:48:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16659v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.ST", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
{"title": "Considerations on the use of financial ratios in the study of family businesses", "abstract": "Most empirical works that study the financing decisions of family businesses\nuse financial ratios. These data present asymmetry, non-normality,\nnon-linearity and even dependence on the results of the choice of which\naccounting figure goes to the numerator and denominator of the ratio. This\narticle uses compositional data analysis (CoDa) as well as classical analysis\nstrategies to compare the structure of balance sheet liabilities between family\nand non-family businesses, showing the sensitivity of the results to the\nmethodology used. The results prove the need to use appropriate methodologies\nto advance the academic discipline.", "published": "2025-01-28 08:50:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16793v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Why is the estimation of metaorder impact with public market data so challenging?", "abstract": "Estimating market impact and transaction costs of large trades (metaorders)\nis a very important topic in finance. However, using models of price and trade\nbased on public market data provide average price trajectories which are\nqualitatively different from what is observed during real metaorder executions:\nthe price increases linearly, rather than in a concave way, during the\nexecution and the amount of reversion after its end is very limited. We claim\nthat this is a generic phenomenon due to the fact that even sophisticated\nstatistical models are unable to correctly describe the origin of the\nautocorrelation of the order flow. We propose a modified Transient Impact Model\nwhich provides more realistic trajectories by assuming that only a fraction of\nthe metaorder trading triggers market order flow. Interestingly, in our model\nthere is a critical condition on the kernels of the price and order flow\nequations in which market impact becomes permanent.", "published": "2025-01-28 17:29:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17096v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.AI", "econ.EM", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
