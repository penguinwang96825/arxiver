{"title": "Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram\n  Predictions", "abstract": "This paper describes Tacotron 2, a neural network architecture for speech\nsynthesis directly from text. The system is composed of a recurrent\nsequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings\nto mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a\nvocoder to synthesize timedomain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model\nachieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of $4.53$ comparable to a MOS of $4.58$ for\nprofessionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present\nablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of\nusing mel spectrograms as the input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration,\nand $F_0$ features. We further demonstrate that using a compact acoustic\nintermediate representation enables significant simplification of the WaveNet\narchitecture.", "published": "2017-12-16 00:51:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "NegBio: a high-performance tool for negation and uncertainty detection\n  in radiology reports", "abstract": "Negative and uncertain medical findings are frequent in radiology reports,\nbut discriminating them from positive findings remains challenging for\ninformation extraction. Here, we propose a new algorithm, NegBio, to detect\nnegative and uncertain findings in radiology reports. Unlike previous\nrule-based methods, NegBio utilizes patterns on universal dependencies to\nidentify the scope of triggers that are indicative of negation or uncertainty.\nWe evaluated NegBio on four datasets, including two public benchmarking corpora\nof radiology reports, a new radiology corpus that we annotated for this work,\nand a public corpus of general clinical texts. Evaluation on these datasets\ndemonstrates that NegBio is highly accurate for detecting negative and\nuncertain findings and compares favorably to a widely-used state-of-the-art\nsystem NegEx (an average of 9.5% improvement in precision and 5.1% in\nF1-score).", "published": "2017-12-16 03:43:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05898v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Train Once, Test Anywhere: Zero-Shot Learning for Text Classification", "abstract": "Zero-shot Learners are models capable of predicting unseen classes. In this\nwork, we propose a Zero-shot Learning approach for text categorization. Our\nmethod involves training model on a large corpus of sentences to learn the\nrelationship between a sentence and embedding of sentence's tags. Learning such\nrelationship makes the model generalize to unseen sentences, tags, and even new\ndatasets provided they can be put into same embedding space. The model learns\nto predict whether a given sentence is related to a tag or not; unlike other\nclassifiers that learn to classify the sentence as one of the possible classes.\nWe propose three different neural networks for the task and report their\naccuracy on the test set of the dataset used for training them as well as two\nother standard datasets for which no retraining was done. We show that our\nmodels generalize well across new unseen classes in both cases. Although the\nmodels do not achieve the accuracy level of the state of the art supervised\nmodels, yet it evidently is a step forward towards general intelligence in\nnatural language processing.", "published": "2017-12-16 15:17:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05972v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Characterizing Political Fake News in Twitter by its Meta-Data", "abstract": "This article presents a preliminary approach towards characterizing political\nfake news on Twitter through the analysis of their meta-data. In particular, we\nfocus on more than 1.5M tweets collected on the day of the election of Donald\nTrump as 45th president of the United States of America. We use the meta-data\nembedded within those tweets in order to look for differences between tweets\ncontaining fake news and tweets not containing them. Specifically, we perform\nour analysis only on tweets that went viral, by studying proxies for users'\nexposure to the tweets, by characterizing accounts spreading fake news, and by\nlooking at their polarization. We found significant differences on the\ndistribution of followers, the number of URLs on tweets, and the verification\nof the users.", "published": "2017-12-16 18:07:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05999v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Taming Wild High Dimensional Text Data with a Fuzzy Lash", "abstract": "The bag of words (BOW) represents a corpus in a matrix whose elements are the\nfrequency of words. However, each row in the matrix is a very high-dimensional\nsparse vector. Dimension reduction (DR) is a popular method to address sparsity\nand high-dimensionality issues. Among different strategies to develop DR\nmethod, Unsupervised Feature Transformation (UFT) is a popular strategy to map\nall words on a new basis to represent BOW. The recent increase of text data and\nits challenges imply that DR area still needs new perspectives. Although a wide\nrange of methods based on the UFT strategy has been developed, the fuzzy\napproach has not been considered for DR based on this strategy. This research\ninvestigates the application of fuzzy clustering as a DR method based on the\nUFT strategy to collapse BOW matrix to provide a lower-dimensional\nrepresentation of documents instead of the words in a corpus. The quantitative\nevaluation shows that fuzzy clustering produces superior performance and\nfeatures to Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), two popular DR methods based on the UFT strategy.", "published": "2017-12-16 17:57:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05997v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
