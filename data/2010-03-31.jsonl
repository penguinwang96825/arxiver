{"title": "A Triple-Error-Correcting Cyclic Code from the Gold and Kasami-Welch APN Power Functions", "abstract": "Based on a sufficient condition proposed by Hollmann and Xiang for constructing triple-error-correcting codes, the minimum distance of a binary cyclic code $\\mathcal{C}_{1,3,13}$ with three zeros $\u03b1$, $\u03b1^3$, and $\u03b1^{13}$ of length $2^m-1$ and the weight divisibility of its dual code are studied, where $m\\geq 5$ is odd and $\u03b1$ is a primitive element of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. The code $\\mathcal{C}_{1,3,13}$ is proven to have the same weight distribution as the binary triple-error-correcting primitive BCH code $\\mathcal{C}_{1,3,5}$ of the same length.", "published": "2010-03-31 09:08:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5993v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}

{"title": "Nonuniversal distributions of stock returns in an emerging market", "abstract": "There is convincing evidence showing that the probability distributions of stock returns in mature markets exhibit power-law tails and both the positive and negative tails conform to the inverse cubic law. It supports the possibility that the tail exponents are universal at least for mature markets in the sense that they do not depend on stock market, industry sector, and market capitalization. We investigate the distributions of one-minute intraday returns of all the A-share stocks traded in the Chinese stock market, which is the largest emerging market in the world. We find that the returns can be well fitted by the $q$-Gaussian distribution and the tails have power-law relaxations with the exponents fluctuating around $\u03b1=3$ and being well outside the L\u00e9vy stable regime for individual stocks. We provide statistically significant evidence showing that the exponents logarithmically decrease with the turnover rate and increase with the market capitalization, and find that the market capitalization has a greater impact on the tail exponent than the turnover rate. Our findings indicate that the intraday return distributions are not universal in emerging stock markets.", "published": "2010-03-31 07:06:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5984v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
