{"title": "Using English as Pivot to Extract Persian-Italian Parallel Sentences\n  from Non-Parallel Corpora", "abstract": "The effectiveness of a statistical machine translation system (SMT) is very\ndependent upon the amount of parallel corpus used in the training phase. For\nlow-resource language pairs there are not enough parallel corpora to build an\naccurate SMT. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to extract bilingual\nPersian-Italian parallel sentences from a non-parallel (comparable) corpus. In\nthis study, English is used as the pivot language to compute the matching\nscores between source and target sentences and candidate selection phase.\nAdditionally, a new monolingual sentence similarity metric, Normalized Google\nDistance (NGD) is proposed to improve the matching process. Moreover, some\nextensions of the baseline system are applied to improve the quality of\nextracted sentences measured with BLEU. Experimental results show that using\nthe new pivot based extraction can increase the quality of bilingual corpus\nsignificantly and consequently improves the performance of the Persian-Italian\nSMT system.", "published": "2017-01-29 00:22:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08339v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Extracting Bilingual Persian Italian Lexicon from Comparable Corpora\n  Using Different Types of Seed Dictionaries", "abstract": "Bilingual dictionaries are very important in various fields of natural\nlanguage processing. In recent years, research on extracting new bilingual\nlexicons from non-parallel (comparable) corpora have been proposed. Almost all\nuse a small existing dictionary or other resources to make an initial list\ncalled the \"seed dictionary\". In this paper, we discuss the use of different\ntypes of dictionaries as the initial starting list for creating a bilingual\nPersian-Italian lexicon from a comparable corpus. Our experiments apply\nstate-of-the-art techniques on three different seed dictionaries; an existing\ndictionary, a dictionary created with pivot-based schema, and a dictionary\nextracted from a small Persian-Italian parallel text. The interesting challenge\nof our approach is to find a way to combine different dictionaries together in\norder to produce a better and more accurate lexicon. In order to combine seed\ndictionaries, we propose two different combination models and examine the\neffect of our novel combination models on various comparable corpora that have\ndiffering degrees of comparability. We conclude with a proposal for a new\nweighting system to improve the extracted lexicon. The experimental results\nproduced by our implementation show the efficiency of our proposed models.", "published": "2017-01-29 00:28:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08340v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
