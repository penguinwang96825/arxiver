{"title": "Syllabification by Phone Categorization", "abstract": "Syllables play an important role in speech synthesis, speech recognition, and\nspoken document retrieval. A novel, low cost, and language agnostic approach to\ndividing words into their corresponding syllables is presented. A hybrid\ngenetic algorithm constructs a categorization of phones optimized for\nsyllabification. This categorization is used on top of a hidden Markov model\nsequence classifier to find syllable boundaries. The technique shows promising\npreliminary results when trained and tested on English words.", "published": "2018-07-15 09:23:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05518v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "WordNet-Based Information Retrieval Using Common Hypernyms and Combined\n  Features", "abstract": "Text search based on lexical matching of keywords is not satisfactory due to\npolysemous and synonymous words. Semantic search that exploits word meanings,\nin general, improves search performance. In this paper, we survey WordNet-based\ninformation retrieval systems, which employ a word sense disambiguation method\nto process queries and documents. The problem is that in many cases a word has\nmore than one possible direct sense, and picking only one of them may give a\nwrong sense for the word. Moreover, the previous systems use only word forms to\nrepresent word senses and their hypernyms. We propose a novel approach that\nuses the most specific common hypernym of the remaining undisambiguated\nmulti-senses of a word, as well as combined WordNet features to represent word\nmeanings. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that, in terms of the MAP\nmeasure, our search engine is 17.7% better than the lexical search, and at\nleast 9.4% better than all surveyed search systems using WordNet.\n  Keywords Ontology, word sense disambiguation, semantic annotation, semantic\nsearch.", "published": "2018-07-15 16:49:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05574v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
