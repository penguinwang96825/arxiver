{"title": "LAF-Fabric: a data analysis tool for Linguistic Annotation Framework\n  with an application to the Hebrew Bible", "abstract": "The Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) provides a general, extensible\nstand-off markup system for corpora. This paper discusses LAF-Fabric, a new\ntool to analyse LAF resources in general with an extension to process the\nHebrew Bible in particular. We first walk through the history of the Hebrew\nBible as text database in decennium-wide steps. Then we describe how LAF-Fabric\nmay serve as an analysis tool for this corpus. Finally, we describe three\nanalytic projects/workflows that benefit from the new LAF representation:\n  1) the study of linguistic variation: extract cooccurrence data of common\nnouns between the books of the Bible (Martijn Naaijer); 2) the study of the\ngrammar of Hebrew poetry in the Psalms: extract clause typology (Gino Kalkman);\n3) construction of a parser of classical Hebrew by Data Oriented Parsing:\ngenerate tree structures from the database (Andreas van Cranenburgh).", "published": "2014-10-01 16:53:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0286v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Morphological Analyzer for Japanese Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives", "abstract": "We present an open source morphological analyzer for Japanese nouns, verbs\nand adjectives. The system builds upon the morphological analyzing capabilities\nof MeCab to incorporate finer details of classification such as politeness,\ntense, mood and voice attributes. We implemented our analyzer in the form of a\nfinite state transducer using the open source finite state compiler FOMA\ntoolkit.

{"title": "A Multi-World Approach to Question Answering about Real-World Scenes\n  based on Uncertain Input", "abstract": "We propose a method for automatically answering questions about images by\nbringing together recent advances from natural language processing and computer\nvision. We combine discrete reasoning with uncertain predictions by a\nmulti-world approach that represents uncertainty about the perceived world in a\nbayesian framework. Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity\nabout realistic scenes and replies with range of answer like counts, object\nclasses, instances and lists of them. The system is directly trained from\nquestion-answer pairs. We establish a first benchmark for this task that can be\nseen as a modern attempt at a visual turing test.", "published": "2014-10-01 12:59:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0210v4", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Using social network graph analysis for interest detection", "abstract": "A person's interests exist as an internal state and are difficult to define.\nSince only external actions are observable, a proxy must be used that\nrepresents someone's interests. Techniques like collaborative filtering,\nbehavioral targeting, and hashtag analysis implicitly model an individual's\ninterests. I argue that these models are limited to shallow, temporary\ninterests, which do not reflect people's deeper interests or passions. I\npropose an alternative model of interests that takes advantage of a user's\nsocial graph. The basic principle is that people only follow those that\ninterest them, so the social graph is an effective and robust proxy for\npeople's interests.", "published": "2014-10-01 18:15:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0316v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
