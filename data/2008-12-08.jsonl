{"title": "A quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme for Euclidean capacitated vehicle routing", "abstract": "In the capacitated vehicle routing problem, introduced by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959, we are given the locations of n customers and a depot, along with a vehicle of capacity k, and wish to find a minimum length collection of tours, each starting from the depot and visiting at most k customers, whose union covers all the customers. We give a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme for the setting where the customers and the depot are on the plane, and distances are given by the Euclidean metric.", "published": "2008-12-08 23:58:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1595v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
