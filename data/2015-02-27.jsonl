{"title": "Local Translation Prediction with Global Sentence Representation", "abstract": "Statistical machine translation models have made great progress in improving\nthe translation quality. However, the existing models predict the target\ntranslation with only the source- and target-side local context information. In\npractice, distinguishing good translations from bad ones does not only depend\non the local features, but also rely on the global sentence-level information.\nIn this paper, we explore the source-side global sentence-level features for\ntarget-side local translation prediction. We propose a novel\nbilingually-constrained chunk-based convolutional neural network to learn\nsentence semantic representations. With the sentence-level feature\nrepresentation, we further design a feed-forward neural network to better\npredict translations using both local and global information. The large-scale\nexperiments show that our method can obtain substantial improvements in\ntranslation quality over the strong baseline: the hierarchical phrase-based\ntranslation model augmented with the neural network joint model.", "published": "2015-02-27 14:55:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07920v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Parsing as Reduction", "abstract": "We reduce phrase-representation parsing to dependency parsing. Our reduction\nis grounded on a new intermediate representation, \"head-ordered dependency\ntrees\", shown to be isomorphic to constituent trees. By encoding order\ninformation in the dependency labels, we show that any off-the-shelf, trainable\ndependency parser can be used to produce constituents. When this parser is\nnon-projective, we can perform discontinuous parsing in a very natural manner.\nDespite the simplicity of our approach, experiments show that the resulting\nparsers are on par with strong baselines, such as the Berkeley parser for\nEnglish and the best single system in the SPMRL-2014 shared task. Results are\nparticularly striking for discontinuous parsing of German, where we surpass the\ncurrent state of the art by a wide margin.", "published": "2015-02-27 22:52:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00030v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Author Name Disambiguation by Using Deep Neural Network", "abstract": "Author name ambiguity decreases the quality and reliability of information\nretrieved from digital libraries. Existing methods have tried to solve this\nproblem by predefining a feature set based on expert's knowledge for a specific\ndataset. In this paper, we propose a new approach which uses deep neural\nnetwork to learn features automatically from data. Additionally, we propose the\ngeneral system architecture for author name disambiguation on any dataset. In\nthis research, we evaluate the proposed method on a dataset containing\nVietnamese author names. The results show that this method significantly\noutperforms other methods that use predefined feature set. The proposed method\nachieves 99.31% in terms of accuracy. Prediction error rate decreases from\n1.83% to 0.69%, i.e., it decreases by 1.14%, or 62.3% relatively compared with\nother methods that use predefined feature set (Table 3).", "published": "2015-02-27 19:34:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08030v2", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}

{"title": "Describing Videos by Exploiting Temporal Structure", "abstract": "Recent progress in using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for image\ndescription has motivated the exploration of their application for video\ndescription. However, while images are static, working with videos requires\nmodeling their dynamic temporal structure and then properly integrating that\ninformation into a natural language description. In this context, we propose an\napproach that successfully takes into account both the local and global\ntemporal structure of videos to produce descriptions. First, our approach\nincorporates a spatial temporal 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D CNN)\nrepresentation of the short temporal dynamics. The 3-D CNN representation is\ntrained on video action recognition tasks, so as to produce a representation\nthat is tuned to human motion and behavior. Second we propose a temporal\nattention mechanism that allows to go beyond local temporal modeling and learns\nto automatically select the most relevant temporal segments given the\ntext-generating RNN. Our approach exceeds the current state-of-art for both\nBLEU and METEOR metrics on the Youtube2Text dataset. We also present results on\na new, larger and more challenging dataset of paired video and natural language\ndescriptions.", "published": "2015-02-27 19:30:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08029v5", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
