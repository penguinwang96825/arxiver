{"title": "Learning to Remember Translation History with a Continuous Cache", "abstract": "Existing neural machine translation (NMT) models generally translate\nsentences in isolation, missing the opportunity to take advantage of\ndocument-level information. In this work, we propose to augment NMT models with\na very light-weight cache-like memory network, which stores recent hidden\nrepresentations as translation history. The probability distribution over\ngenerated words is updated online depending on the translation history\nretrieved from the memory, endowing NMT models with the capability to\ndynamically adapt over time. Experiments on multiple domains with different\ntopics and styles show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with\nnegligible impact on the computational cost.", "published": "2017-11-26 10:44:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09367v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Machine Translation using Semantic Web Technologies: A Survey", "abstract": "A large number of machine translation approaches have recently been developed\nto facilitate the fluid migration of content across languages. However, the\nliterature suggests that many obstacles must still be dealt with to achieve\nbetter automatic translations. One of these obstacles is lexical and syntactic\nambiguity. A promising way of overcoming this problem is using Semantic Web\ntechnologies. This article presents the results of a systematic review of\nmachine translation approaches that rely on Semantic Web technologies for\ntranslating texts. Overall, our survey suggests that while Semantic Web\ntechnologies can enhance the quality of machine translation outputs for various\nproblems, the combination of both is still in its infancy.", "published": "2017-11-26 22:30:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09476v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generative Adversarial Network for Abstractive Text Summarization", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an adversarial process for abstractive text\nsummarization, in which we simultaneously train a generative model G and a\ndiscriminative model D. In particular, we build the generator G as an agent of\nreinforcement learning, which takes the raw text as input and predicts the\nabstractive summarization. We also build a discriminator which attempts to\ndistinguish the generated summary from the ground truth summary. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model achieves competitive ROUGE scores with\nthe state-of-the-art methods on CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Qualitatively, we show\nthat our model is able to generate more abstractive, readable and diverse\nsummaries.", "published": "2017-11-26 09:45:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09357v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Realistic multi-microphone data simulation for distant speech\n  recognition", "abstract": "The availability of realistic simulated corpora is of key importance for the\nfuture progress of distant speech recognition technology. The reliability,\nflexibility and low computational cost of a data simulation process may\nultimately allow researchers to train, tune and test different techniques in a\nvariety of acoustic scenarios, avoiding the laborious effort of directly\nrecording real data from the targeted environment.\n  In the last decade, several simulated corpora have been released to the\nresearch community, including the data-sets distributed in the context of\nprojects and international challenges, such as CHiME and REVERB. These efforts\nwere extremely useful to derive baselines and common evaluation frameworks for\ncomparison purposes. At the same time, in many cases they highlighted the need\nof a better coherence between real and simulated conditions.\n  In this paper, we examine this issue and we describe our approach to the\ngeneration of realistic corpora in a domestic context. Experimental validation,\nconducted in a multi-microphone scenario, shows that a comparable performance\ntrend can be observed with both real and simulated data across different\nrecognition frameworks, acoustic models, as well as multi-microphone processing\ntechniques.", "published": "2017-11-26 22:08:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09470v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
