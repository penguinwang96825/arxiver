{"title": "Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions", "abstract": "Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies,\nenhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing\naccuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting\nfaces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and\noverfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating\nParameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs\ninherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality\nconstraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression,\nreducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of\n1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE\n0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with\nangle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights\nthe potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery\nrate forecasting.", "published": "2025-01-27 07:27:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828v4", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
