{"title": "A Novel Architecture For Question Classification Based Indexing Scheme\n  For Efficient Question Answering", "abstract": "Question answering system can be seen as the next step in information\nretrieval, allowing users to pose question in natural language and receive\ncompact answers. For the Question answering system to be successful, research\nhas shown that the correct classification of question with respect to the\nexpected answer type is requisite. We propose a novel architecture for question\nclassification and searching in the index, maintained on the basis of expected\nanswer types, for efficient question answering. The system uses the criteria\nfor Answer Relevance Score for finding the relevance of each answer returned by\nthe system. On analysis of the proposed system, it has been found that the\nsystem has shown promising results than the existing systems based on question\nclassification.", "published": "2013-07-26 06:57:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6937v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
