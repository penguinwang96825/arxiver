{"title": "Extracting Alpha from Financial Analyst Networks", "abstract": "We investigate the effectiveness of a momentum trading signal based on the\ncoverage network of financial analysts. This signal builds on the key\ninformation-brokerage role financial sell-side analysts play in modern stock\nmarkets. The baskets of stocks covered by each analyst can be used to construct\na network between firms whose edge weights represent the number of analysts\njointly covering both firms. Although the link between financial analysts\ncoverage and co-movement of firms' stock prices has been investigated in the\nliterature, little effort has been made to systematically learn the most\neffective combination of signals from firms covered jointly by analysts in\norder to benefit from any spillover effect. To fill this gap, we build a\ntrading strategy which leverages the analyst coverage network using a graph\nattention network. More specifically, our model learns to aggregate information\nfrom individual firm features and signals from neighbouring firms in a\nnode-level forecasting task. We develop a portfolio based on those predictions\nwhich we demonstrate to exhibit an annualized returns of 29.44% and a Sharpe\nratio of 4.06 substantially outperforming market baselines and existing graph\nmachine learning based frameworks. We further investigate the performance and\nrobustness of this strategy through extensive empirical analysis. Our paper\nrepresents one of the first attempts in using graph machine learning to extract\nactionable knowledge from the analyst coverage network for practical financial\napplications.", "published": "2024-10-27 21:11:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20597v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.PM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
