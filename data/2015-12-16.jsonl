{"title": "Morpho-syntactic Lexicon Generation Using Graph-based Semi-supervised\n  Learning", "abstract": "Morpho-syntactic lexicons provide information about the morphological and\nsyntactic roles of words in a language. Such lexicons are not available for all\nlanguages and even when available, their coverage can be limited. We present a\ngraph-based semi-supervised learning method that uses the morphological,\nsyntactic and semantic relations between words to automatically construct wide\ncoverage lexicons from small seed sets. Our method is language-independent, and\nwe show that we can expand a 1000 word seed lexicon to more than 100 times its\nsize with high quality for 11 languages. In addition, the automatically created\nlexicons provide features that improve performance in two downstream tasks:\nmorphological tagging and dependency parsing.", "published": "2015-12-16 02:27:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "ABCNN: Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Modeling\n  Sentence Pairs", "abstract": "How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many NLP tasks such\nas answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification (PI) and textual entailment\n(TE). Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a\nspecific system; (ii) models each sentence's representation separately, rarely\nconsidering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually\ndesigned, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a general\nAttention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of\nsentences. We make three contributions. (i) ABCNN can be applied to a wide\nvariety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose three\nattention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNN;\nthus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its\ncounterpart. These interdependent sentence pair representations are more\npowerful than isolated sentence representations. (iii) ABCNN achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.", "published": "2015-12-16 14:55:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05193v4", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
