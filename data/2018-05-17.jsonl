{"title": "Mad Max: Affine Spline Insights into Deep Learning", "abstract": "We build a rigorous bridge between deep networks (DNs) and approximation theory via spline functions and operators. Our key result is that a large class of DNs can be written as a composition of max-affine spline operators (MASOs), which provide a powerful portal through which to view and analyze their inner workings. For instance, conditioned on the input signal, the output of a MASO DN can be written as a simple affine transformation of the input. This implies that a DN constructs a set of signal-dependent, class-specific templates against which the signal is compared via a simple inner product; we explore the links to the classical theory of optimal classification via matched filters and the effects of data memorization. Going further, we propose a simple penalty term that can be added to the cost function of any DN learning algorithm to force the templates to be orthogonal with each other; this leads to significantly improved classification performance and reduced overfitting with no change to the DN architecture. The spline partition of the input signal space that is implicitly induced by a MASO directly links DNs to the theory of vector quantization (VQ) and $K$-means clustering, which opens up new geometric avenue to study how DNs organize signals in a hierarchical fashion. To validate the utility of the VQ interpretation, we develop and validate a new distance metric for signals and images that quantifies the difference between their VQ encodings.

{"title": "UAV-Aided Cellular Communications with Deep Reinforcement Learning Against Jamming", "abstract": "Cellular systems are vulnerable to jamming attacks, especially smart jammers that choose their jamming policies such as the jamming channel frequencies and power based on the ongoing communication policies and network states. In this article, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided cellular communication framework against jamming. In this scheme, UAVs use reinforcement learning methods to choose the relay policy for mobile users in cellular systems, if the serving base station is heavily jammed. More specifically, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based UAV relay scheme to help cellular systems resist smart jamming without being aware of the jamming model and the network model in the dynamic game based on the previous anti-jamming relay experiences and the observed current network status. This scheme can achieve the optimal performance after enough interactions with the jammer. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the bit error rate of the messages and save energy for the cellular system compared with the existing scheme.", "published": "2018-05-17 07:21:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06628v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Memristor-based Approximation of Gaussian Filter", "abstract": "A Gaussian filter is a filter with impulse response of Gaussian function. These filters are useful in image processing of 2D signals, as it removes unnecessary noise. Also, they could be helpful for data transmission (e.g. GMSK modulation). In practice, the Gaussian filters could be approximately designed by several methods. One of these methods are to construct Gaussian-like filter with the help of memristors and RLC circuits. Therefore, the objective of this project is to find and design appropriate model of Gaussian-like filter, by using mentioned devices. Finally, one possible model of Gaussian-like filter based on memristor designed and analysed in this paper.", "published": "2018-05-17 08:16:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06643v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
