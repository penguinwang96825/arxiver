{"title": "Linear-Time Constituency Parsing with RNNs and Dynamic Programming", "abstract": "Recently, span-based constituency parsing has achieved competitive accuracies\nwith extremely simple models by using bidirectional RNNs to model \"spans\".\nHowever, the minimal span parser of Stern et al (2017a) which holds the current\nstate of the art accuracy is a chart parser running in cubic time, $O(n^3)$,\nwhich is too slow for longer sentences and for applications beyond sentence\nboundaries such as end-to-end discourse parsing and joint sentence boundary\ndetection and parsing. We propose a linear-time constituency parser with RNNs\nand dynamic programming using graph-structured stack and beam search, which\nruns in time $O(n b^2)$ where $b$ is the beam size. We further speed this up to\n$O(n b\\log b)$ by integrating cube pruning.

{"title": "FastFCA: A Joint Diagonalization Based Fast Algorithm for Audio Source\n  Separation Using A Full-Rank Spatial Covariance Model", "abstract": "A source separation method using a full-rank spatial covariance model has\nbeen proposed by Duong et al. [\"Under-determined Reverberant Audio Source\nSeparation Using a Full-rank Spatial Covariance Model,\" IEEE Trans. ASLP, vol.\n18, no. 7, pp. 1830-1840, Sep. 2010], which is referred to as full-rank spatial\ncovariance analysis (FCA) in this paper. Here we propose a fast algorithm for\nestimating the model parameters of the FCA, which is named Fast-FCA, and\napplicable to the two-source case. Though quite effective in source separation,\nthe conventional FCA has a major drawback of expensive computation. Indeed, the\nconventional algorithm for estimating the model parameters of the FCA requires\nframe-wise matrix inversion and matrix multiplication. Therefore, the\nconventional FCA may be infeasible in applications with restricted\ncomputational resources. In contrast, the proposed FastFCA bypasses matrix\ninversion and matrix multiplication owing to joint diagonalization based on the\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem. Furthermore, the FastFCA is strictly equivalent\nto the conventional algorithm. An experiment has shown that the FastFCA was\nover 250 times faster than the conventional algorithm with virtually the same\nsource separation performance.", "published": "2018-05-17 01:47:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06572v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
