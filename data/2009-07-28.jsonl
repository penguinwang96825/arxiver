{"title": "The Distributions in Nature and Entropy Principle", "abstract": "The derivation of the maximum entropy distribution of particles in boxes yields two kinds of distributions: a \"bell-like\" distribution and a long-tail distribution. The first one is obtained when the ratio between particles and boxes is low, and the second one - when the ratio is high. The obtained long tail distribution yields correctly the empirical Zipf law, Pareto's 20:80 rule and Benford's law. Therefore, it is concluded that the long tail and the \"bell-like\" distributions are outcomes of the tendency of statistical systems to maximize entropy.", "published": "2009-07-28 07:34:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4852v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
