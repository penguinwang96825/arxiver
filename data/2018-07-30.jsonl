{"title": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Adversarial Learning for Robust Speech Recognition", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the use of adversarial learning for unsupervised adaptation to unseen recording conditions, more specifically, single microphone far-field speech. We adapt neural networks based acoustic models trained with close-talk clean speech to the new recording conditions using untranscribed adaptation data. Our experimental results on Italian SPEECON data set show that our proposed method achieves 19.8% relative word error rate (WER) reduction compared to the unadapted models. Furthermore, this adaptation method is beneficial even when performed on data from another language (i.e. French) giving 12.6% relative WER reduction.", "published": "2018-07-30 11:00:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11284v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Making Classifier Chains Resilient to Class Imbalance", "abstract": "Class imbalance is an intrinsic characteristic of multi-label data. Most of the labels in multi-label data sets are associated with a small number of training examples, much smaller compared to the size of the data set. Class imbalance poses a key challenge that plagues most multi-label learning methods. Ensemble of Classifier Chains (ECC), one of the most prominent multi-label learning methods, is no exception to this rule, as each of the binary models it builds is trained from all positive and negative examples of a label. To make ECC resilient to class imbalance, we first couple it with random undersampling. We then present two extensions of this basic approach, where we build a varying number of binary models per label and construct chains of different sizes, in order to improve the exploitation of majority examples with approximately the same computational budget. Experimental results on 16 multi-label datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in a variety of evaluation metrics.", "published": "2018-07-30 15:13:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11393v4", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "DCASE 2018 Challenge - Task 5: Monitoring of domestic activities based on multi-channel acoustics", "abstract": "The DCASE 2018 Challenge consists of five tasks related to automatic classification and detection of sound events and scenes. This paper presents the setup of Task 5 which includes the description of the task, dataset and the baseline system. In this task, it is investigated to which extent multi-channel acoustic recordings are beneficial for the purpose of classifying domestic activities. The goal is to exploit spectral and spatial cues independent of sensor location using multi-channel audio. For this purpose we provided a development and evaluation dataset which are derivatives of the SINS database and contain domestic activities recorded by multiple microphone arrays. The baseline system, based on a Neural Network architecture using convolutional and dense layer(s), is intended to lower the hurdle to participate the challenge and to provide a reference performance.", "published": "2018-07-30 09:15:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11246v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "Sub-Nyquist Radar Systems: Temporal, Spectral and Spatial Compression", "abstract": "Conventional radar transmits electromagnetic waves towards the targets of interest. In between the outgoing pulses, the radar measures the signal reflected from the targets to determine their presence, range, velocity and other characteristics. Radar systems face multiple challenges, generating many trade-offs such as bandwidth versus range resolution and dwell time versus Doppler resolution. In MIMO radar, high resolution requires a large aperture and high number of antennas, increasing hardware and processing requirements.\n  Recently, novel approaches in sampling theory and radar signal processing have been proposed to allow target detection and parameter recovery from samples obtained below the Nyquist rate. These techniques exploit the sparsity of the target scene in order to reduce the required number of samples, pulses and antennas, breaking the link between bandwidth, dwell time and number of antennas on the one hand and range, Doppler and azimuth resolution, respectively, on the other.\n  This review introduces this so-called sub-Nyquist radar paradigm and describes the corresponding sampling and recovery algorithms, that leverage compressed sensing techniques to perform time and spatial compression. We focus on non radar imaging applications and survey many recent compressed radar systems. Our goal is to review the main impacts of compressed radar on parameter resolution as well as digital and analog complexity. The survey includes fast and slow time compression schemes as well as spatial compression approaches. We show that beyond substantial rate reduction, compression may also enable communication and radar spectrum sharing. Throughout the paper, we consider both theoretical and practical aspects of compressed radar, and present hardware prototype implementations, demonstrating real-time target parameter recovery from low rate samples in pulse-Doppler and MIMO radars.", "published": "2018-07-30 19:34:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11542v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
