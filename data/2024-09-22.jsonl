{"title": "SARF: Enhancing Stock Market Prediction with Sentiment-Augmented Random Forest", "abstract": "Stock trend forecasting, a challenging problem in the financial domain,\ninvolves ex-tensive data and related indicators. Relying solely on empirical\nanalysis often yields unsustainable and ineffective results. Machine learning\nresearchers have demonstrated that the application of random forest algorithm\ncan enhance predictions in this context, playing a crucial auxiliary role in\nforecasting stock trends. This study introduces a new approach to stock market\nprediction by integrating sentiment analysis using FinGPT generative AI model\nwith the traditional Random Forest model. The proposed technique aims to\noptimize the accuracy of stock price forecasts by leveraging the nuanced\nunderstanding of financial sentiments provided by FinGPT. We present a new\nmethodology called \"Sentiment-Augmented Random Forest\" (SARF), which\nin-corporates sentiment features into the Random Forest framework. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that SARF outperforms conventional Random Forest and\nLSTM models with an average accuracy improvement of 9.23% and lower prediction\nerrors in pre-dicting stock market movements.", "published": "2024-09-22 20:22:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07143v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
