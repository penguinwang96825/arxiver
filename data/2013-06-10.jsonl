{"title": "A framework for (under)specifying dependency syntax without overloading\n  annotators", "abstract": "We introduce a framework for lightweight dependency syntax annotation. Our\nformalism builds upon the typical representation for unlabeled dependencies,\npermitting a simple notation and annotation workflow. Moreover, the formalism\nencourages annotators to underspecify parts of the syntax if doing so would\nstreamline the annotation process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this\nannotation on three languages and develop algorithms to evaluate and compare\nunderspecified annotations.", "published": "2013-06-10 02:54:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2091v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "\"Not not bad\" is not \"bad\": A distributional account of negation", "abstract": "With the increasing empirical success of distributional models of\ncompositional semantics, it is timely to consider the types of textual logic\nthat such models are capable of capturing. In this paper, we address\nshortcomings in the ability of current models to capture logical operations\nsuch as negation. As a solution we propose a tripartite formulation for a\ncontinuous vector space representation of semantics and subsequently use this\nrepresentation to develop a formal compositional notion of negation within such\nmodels.", "published": "2013-06-10 10:29:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2158v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
