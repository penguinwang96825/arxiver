{"title": "Intent Detection for code-mix utterances in task oriented dialogue\n  systems", "abstract": "Intent detection is an essential component of task oriented dialogue systems.\nOver the years, extensive research has been conducted resulting in many state\nof the art models directed towards resolving user's intents in dialogue. A\nvariety of vector representations foruser utterances have been explored for the\nsame. However, these models and vectorization approaches have more so been\nevaluated in a single language environment. Dialogude systems generally have to\ndeal with queries in different languages. We thus conduct experiments across\ncombinations of models and various vectors representations for Code Mix as well\nas multi language utterances and evaluate how these models scale to a multi\nlanguage environment. Our aim is to find the best suitable combination of\nvector representation and models for the process of intent detection for Code\nMix utterances. we have evaluated the experiments on two different datasets\nconsisting of only Code Mix utterances and the other dataset consisting of\nEnglish, Hindi and Code Mix English Hindi utterances.", "published": "2018-12-07 05:23:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02914v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Improving Retrieval-Based Question Answering with Deep Inference Models", "abstract": "Question answering is one of the most important and difficult applications at\nthe border of information retrieval and natural language processing, especially\nwhen we talk about complex science questions which require some form of\ninference to determine the correct answer. In this paper, we present a two-step\nmethod that combines information retrieval techniques optimized for question\nanswering with deep learning models for natural language inference in order to\ntackle the multi-choice question answering in the science domain. For each\nquestion-answer pair, we use standard retrieval-based models to find relevant\ncandidate contexts and decompose the main problem into two different\nsub-problems. First, assign correctness scores for each candidate answer based\non the context using retrieval models from Lucene. Second, we use deep learning\narchitectures to compute if a candidate answer can be inferred from some\nwell-chosen context consisting of sentences retrieved from the knowledge base.\nIn the end, all these solvers are combined using a simple neural network to\npredict the correct answer. This proposed two-step model outperforms the best\nretrieval-based solver by over 3% in absolute accuracy.", "published": "2018-12-07 10:44:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02971v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

On the other hand, averaging signals of the same nature is\nan essential tool in the analysis of different kinds of data. Here we propose a\nmethod to align and average segments of time series with similar patterns. A\nsimple implementation based on \\textit{python} code is provided for the\nprocedure. The analysis was inspired by the study of canary sound syllables,\nbut it is possible to apply it in semi periodic signals of different nature and\nnot necessarily related to sounds.", "published": "2018-12-07 13:23:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03021v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
