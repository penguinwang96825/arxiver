{"title": "Hierarchical Decompositions of dihypergraphs", "abstract": "In this paper we are interested in decomposing a dihypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, \\mathcal{E})$ into simpler dihypergraphs, that can be handled more efficiently. We study the properties of dihypergraphs that can be hierarchically decomposed into trivial dihypergraphs, \\ie vertex hypergraph. The hierarchical decomposition is represented by a full labelled binary tree called $\\mathcal{H}$-tree, in the fashion of hierarchical clustering. We present a polynomial time and space algorithm to achieve such a decomposition by producing its corresponding $\\mathcal{H}$-tree. However, there are dihypergraphs that cannot be completely decomposed into trivial components. Therefore, we relax this requirement to more indecomposable dihypergraphs called H-factors, and discuss applications of this decomposition to closure systems and lattices.", "published": "2020-06-21 15:43:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11831v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
