{"title": "Decision-informed Neural Networks with Large Language Model Integration for Portfolio Optimization", "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical disconnect between prediction and decision\nquality in portfolio optimization by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith decision-focused learning. We demonstrate both theoretically and\nempirically that minimizing the prediction error alone leads to suboptimal\nportfolio decisions. We aim to exploit the representational power of LLMs for\ninvestment decisions. An attention mechanism processes asset relationships,\ntemporal dependencies, and macro variables, which are then directly integrated\ninto a portfolio optimization layer. This enables the model to capture complex\nmarket dynamics and align predictions with the decision objectives. Extensive\nexperiments on S\\&P100 and DOW30 datasets show that our model consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. In addition, gradient-based\nanalyses show that our model prioritizes the assets most crucial to decision\nmaking, thus mitigating the effects of prediction errors on portfolio\nperformance. These findings underscore the value of integrating decision\nobjectives into predictions for more robust and context-aware portfolio\nmanagement.", "published": "2025-02-02 15:45:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00828v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "cs.AI", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}

{"title": "On Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and the Black-Scholes Model", "abstract": "Two novel and direct quantum mechanical representations of the Black-Scholes\nmodel are constructed based on the (Wick-rotated) quantization of two specific\nmechanical systems. The quantum setup is achieved by means of the associated\nLaplace-Beltrami operator (one for each model), and not by merely applying the\nusual naive rule. Additionally, the clear identification of the geometric\ncontent of the underlying classical framework is exploited in order to arrive\nat a noncommutative quantum mechanics generalization of the Black-Scholes\nmodel. We also consider a system consisting of two degrees of freedom whose\n(Wick-rotated) quantization leads to a model which can be seen as related to\nthe Merton-Garman family. This model is also generalized via noncommutative\nquantum mechanics.", "published": "2025-02-02 22:10:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00938v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Trade Dynamics of the Global Dry Bulk Shipping Network", "abstract": "This study investigates the inherently random structures of dry bulk shipping\nnetworks, often likened to a taxi service, and identifies the underlying trade\ndynamics that contribute to this randomness within individual cargo\nsub-networks. By analysing micro-level trade flow data from 2015 to 2023, we\nexplore the evolution of dry commodity networks, including grain, coal, and\niron ore, and suggest that the Giant Strongly Connected Components exhibit\nsmall-world phenomena, indicative of efficient bilateral trade. The significant\nheterogeneity of in-degree and out-degree within these sub-networks, primarily\ndriven by importing ports, underscores the complexity of their dynamics. Our\ntemporal analysis shows that while the Covid-19 pandemic profoundly impacted\nthe coal network, the Ukraine conflict significantly altered the grain network,\nresulting in changes in community structures. Notably, grain sub-networks\ndisplay periodic changes, suggesting distinct life cycles absent in coal and\niron ore networks. These findings illustrate that the randomness in dry bulk\nshipping networks is a reflection of real-world trade dynamics, providing\nvaluable insights for stakeholders in navigating and predicting network\nbehaviours.", "published": "2025-02-02 19:01:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00877v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
