{"title": "QANUS: An Open-source Question-Answering Platform", "abstract": "In this paper, we motivate the need for a publicly available, generic\nsoftware framework for question-answering (QA) systems. We present an\nopen-source QA framework QANUS which researchers can leverage on to build new\nQA systems easily and rapidly. The framework implements much of the code that\nwill otherwise have been repeated across different QA systems. To demonstrate\nthe utility and practicality of the framework, we further present a fully\nfunctioning factoid QA system QA-SYS built on top of QANUS.", "published": "2015-01-01 20:51:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00311v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
