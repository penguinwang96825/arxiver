{"title": "A Sea of Coins: The Proliferation of Cryptocurrencies in UniswapV2", "abstract": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized financial markets by enabling\ndecentralized exchanges (DEXs) that operate without intermediaries. Uniswap V2,\na leading DEX, facilitates the rapid creation and trading of new tokens,\noffering high return potential but exposing investors to significant risks. In\nthis work, we analyze the financial impact of newly created tokens, assessing\ntheir market dynamics, profitability and liquidity manipulations. Our findings\nreveal that a significant portion of market liquidity is trapped in honeypots,\nreducing market efficiency and misleading investors. Applying a simple\nbuy-and-hold strategy, we are able to uncover some major risks associated with\ninvesting in newly created tokens, including the widespread presence of rug\npulls and sandwich attacks. We extract the optimal sandwich amount, revealing\nthat their proliferation in new tokens stems from higher profitability in\nlow-liquidity pools. Furthermore, we analyze the fundamental differences\nbetween token price evolution in swap time and physical time. Using clustering\ntechniques, we highlight these differences and identify typical patterns of\nhoneypot and sellable tokens. Our study provides insights into the risks and\nfinancial dynamics of decentralized markets and their challenges for investors.", "published": "2025-02-14 19:18:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10512v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
