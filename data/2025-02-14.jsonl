{"title": "A review of minimum cost box searching games", "abstract": "We consider a class of zero-sum search games in which a Hider hides one or\nmore target among a set of $n$ boxes. The boxes may require differing amount of\ntime to search, and detection may be imperfect, so that there is a certain\nprobability that a target may not be found when a box is searched, even when it\nis there. A Searcher must choose how to search the boxes sequentially, and\nwishes to minimize the expected time to find the target(s), whereas the Hider\nwishes to maximize this payoff. We review some known solutions to different\ncases of this game.", "published": "2025-02-14 20:46:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10551v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.DM"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "Network fault costs based on minimum leaf spanning trees", "abstract": "We study the fault-tolerance of networks from both the structural and\ncomputational point of view using the minimum leaf number of the corresponding\ngraph $G$, i.e. the minimum number of leaves of the spanning trees of $G$, and\nits vertex-deleted subgraphs. We investigate networks that are leaf-guaranteed,\ni.e. which satisfy a certain stability condition with respect to minimum leaf\nnumbers and vertex-deletion. Next to this, our main notion is the so-called\nfault cost, which is based on the number of vertices that have different\ndegrees in minimum leaf spanning trees of the network and its vertex-deleted\nsubgraphs. We characterise networks with vanishing fault cost via\nleaf-guaranteed graphs and describe, for any given network $N$, leaf-guaranteed\nnetworks containing $N$. We determine for all non-negative integers $k \\le 8$\nexcept $1$ the smallest network with fault cost $k$. We also give a detailed\ntreatment of the fault cost $1$ case, prove that there are infinitely many\n$3$-regular networks with fault cost $3$, and show that for any non-negative\ninteger $k$ there exists a network with fault cost exactly $k$.", "published": "2025-02-14 15:08:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10213v1", "categories": ["math.CO", "cs.DM"], "primary_category": "math.CO"}

{"title": "A Sea of Coins: The Proliferation of Cryptocurrencies in UniswapV2", "abstract": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized financial markets by enabling\ndecentralized exchanges (DEXs) that operate without intermediaries. Uniswap V2,\na leading DEX, facilitates the rapid creation and trading of new tokens,\noffering high return potential but exposing investors to significant risks. In\nthis work, we analyze the financial impact of newly created tokens, assessing\ntheir market dynamics, profitability and liquidity manipulations. Our findings\nreveal that a significant portion of market liquidity is trapped in honeypots,\nreducing market efficiency and misleading investors. Applying a simple\nbuy-and-hold strategy, we are able to uncover some major risks associated with\ninvesting in newly created tokens, including the widespread presence of rug\npulls and sandwich attacks. We extract the optimal sandwich amount, revealing\nthat their proliferation in new tokens stems from higher profitability in\nlow-liquidity pools. Furthermore, we analyze the fundamental differences\nbetween token price evolution in swap time and physical time. Using clustering\ntechniques, we highlight these differences and identify typical patterns of\nhoneypot and sellable tokens. Our study provides insights into the risks and\nfinancial dynamics of decentralized markets and their challenges for investors.", "published": "2025-02-14 19:18:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10512v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
