Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically\ngenerated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are\neasier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.", "published": "2025-06-06 17:58:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06275v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics.

We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.\nNext, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main\nresearch directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric\nunderstanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,\nand (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each\ndirection, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,\nwe discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,\nevaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss\nlimitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.\nBy synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire\nadvancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing\nmachines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions.

Research combining these two modalities remains scarce\ncurrently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types\nannotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical\nhyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP\nhyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series.

In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected\nto the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled\nby a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this\npaper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be\ndifferent. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should\nbe injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new\nframework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).\nSpecifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data\npoint deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,\nbased on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to\nadaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise\ninjections.

{"title": "Investigating the Relationship between Weighted Figure of Merit and Rosin's Measure", "abstract": "Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a\ndigital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing\nrequired in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared\ntheir schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the\ngoodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The\nmathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are\nanalyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are\nindependent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments\ncarried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical\nanalysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two\nmeasures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a\nsub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal\nscheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn\nusing weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit\ninstead of Rosin's measure.", "published": "2025-06-06 05:20:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05749v1", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

The carps framework relies\non a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and\nbenchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the\nevaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of\ntasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.\nTo address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the\nstar discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a\nresult, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task\ntype, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become\navailable, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of\nbaseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps\n(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the\nstandardization of HPO evaluation.", "published": "2025-06-06 15:01:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06143v1", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Similarity Matching Networks: Hebbian Learning and Convergence Over Multiple Time Scales", "abstract": "A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for\ndimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function\nand the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological\ninterpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental\nvalidation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on\nthis framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the\n\\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived\nfrom a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of\nthree coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,\nlateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,\nintermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral\nsynaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,\nrespectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove\nconvergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first\nlevel (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and\nglobal exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At\nthe second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the\ncost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow\ndynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final\nlevel (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,\nprovide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure\nconvergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.\nThese results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported\nby thorough numerical experiments.

Among these is transmitter\nfingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be\nauthenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as\nimpairments on the signal.\n  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite\ntransmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple\nreplay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks\ndirectly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for\nmaximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and\ndemonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium\ntransmitters.

To address these\nchallenges in a principled manner, we propose a novel wireless FL framework\ngrounded in Bayesian inference. By virtue of the Bayesian approach, our\nframework captures model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over local\nweights and performs distribution-level aggregation of local distributions into\na global distribution. This mitigates local overfitting and client drift,\nthereby enabling more reliable inference. Nevertheless, adopting Bayesian FL\nincreases communication overhead due to the need to transmit richer model\ninformation and fundamentally alters the aggregation process beyond simple\naveraging. As a result, conventional Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), widely\nused to improve communication efficiency in standard FL, is no longer directly\napplicable. To overcome this limitation, we design a dedicated AirComp scheme\ntailored to Bayesian FL, which efficiently aggregates local posterior\ndistributions at the distribution level by exploiting the superposition\nproperty of wireless channels.
