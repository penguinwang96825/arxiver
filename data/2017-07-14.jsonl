{"title": "Developing a concept-level knowledge base for sentiment analysis in\n  Singlish", "abstract": "In this paper, we present Singlish sentiment lexicon, a concept-level\nknowledge base for sentiment analysis that associates multiword expressions to\na set of emotion labels and a polarity value. Unlike many other sentiment\nanalysis resources, this lexicon is not built by manually labeling pieces of\nknowledge coming from general NLP resources such as WordNet or DBPedia.\nInstead, it is automatically constructed by applying graph-mining and\nmulti-dimensional scaling techniques on the affective common-sense knowledge\ncollected from three different sources. This knowledge is represented\nredundantly at three levels: semantic network, matrix, and vector space.\nSubsequently, the concepts are labeled by emotions and polarity through the\nensemble application of spreading activation, neural networks and an emotion\ncategorization model.", "published": "2017-07-14 08:00:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04408v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Evaluating Semantic Parsing against a Simple Web-based Question\n  Answering Model", "abstract": "Semantic parsing shines at analyzing complex natural language that involves\ncomposition and computation over multiple pieces of evidence. However, datasets\nfor semantic parsing contain many factoid questions that can be answered from a\nsingle web document. In this paper, we propose to evaluate semantic\nparsing-based question answering models by comparing them to a question\nanswering baseline that queries the web and extracts the answer only from web\nsnippets, without access to the target knowledge-base. We investigate this\napproach on COMPLEXQUESTIONS, a dataset designed to focus on compositional\nlanguage, and find that our model obtains reasonable performance (35 F1\ncompared to 41 F1 of state-of-the-art). We find in our analysis that our model\nperforms well on complex questions involving conjunctions, but struggles on\nquestions that involve relation composition and superlatives.", "published": "2017-07-14 08:25:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04412v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Accurate tagging of\narticles can benefit several downstream applications such as recommendation and\nsearch. In this work, we propose a novel yet simple approach called DocTag2Vec\nto accomplish this task. We substantially extend Word2Vec and Doc2Vec---two\npopular models for learning distributed representation of words and documents.\nIn DocTag2Vec, we simultaneously learn the representation of words, documents,\nand tags in a joint vector space during training, and employ the simple\n$k$-nearest neighbor search to predict tags for unseen documents. In contrast\nto previous multi-label learning methods, DocTag2Vec directly deals with raw\ntext instead of provided feature vector, and in addition, enjoys advantages\nlike the learning of tag representation, and the ability of handling newly\ncreated tags. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct\nexperiments on several datasets and show promising results against\nstate-of-the-art methods.", "published": "2017-07-14 18:05:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04596v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "A Semantics-Based Measure of Emoji Similarity", "abstract": "Emoji have grown to become one of the most important forms of communication\non the web. With its widespread use, measuring the similarity of emoji has\nbecome an important problem for contemporary text processing since it lies at\nthe heart of sentiment analysis, search, and interface design tasks.

Using emoji descriptions, emoji sense labels and emoji\nsense definitions, and with different training corpora obtained from Twitter\nand Google News, we develop and test multiple embedding models to measure emoji\nsimilarity. To evaluate our work, we create a new dataset called EmoSim508,\nwhich assigns human-annotated semantic similarity scores to a set of 508\ncarefully selected emoji pairs. After validation with EmoSim508, we present a\nreal-world use-case of our emoji embedding models using a sentiment analysis\ntask and show that our models outperform the previous best-performing emoji\nembedding model on this task.
