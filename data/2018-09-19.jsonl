{"title": "MTLE: A Multitask Learning Encoder of Visual Feature Representations for Video and Movie Description", "abstract": "Learning visual feature representations for video analysis is a daunting task that requires a large amount of training samples and a proper generalization framework. Many of the current state of the art methods for video captioning and movie description rely on simple encoding mechanisms through recurrent neural networks to encode temporal visual information extracted from video data. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitask encoder-decoder framework for automatic semantic description and captioning of video sequences. In contrast to current approaches, our method relies on distinct decoders that train a visual encoder in a multitask fashion. Our system does not depend solely on multiple labels and allows for a lack of training data working even with datasets where only one single annotation is viable per video. Our method shows improved performance over current state of the art methods in several metrics on multi-caption and single-caption datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first method to use a multitask approach for encoding video features. Our method demonstrates its robustness on the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) 2017 where our method won the movie description task and its results were ranked among other competitors as the most helpful for the visually impaired.", "published": "2018-09-19 15:50:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07257v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Pommerman: A Multi-Agent Playground", "abstract": "We present Pommerman, a multi-agent environment based on the classic console game Bomberman. Pommerman consists of a set of scenarios, each having at least four players and containing both cooperative and competitive aspects. We believe that success in Pommerman will require a diverse set of tools and methods, including planning, opponent/teammate modeling, game theory, and communication, and consequently can serve well as a multi-agent benchmark. To date, we have already hosted one competition, and our next one will be featured in the NIPS 2018 competition track.", "published": "2018-09-19 11:27:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07124v2", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Geometric Local Variance Gamma model", "abstract": "This paper describes another extension of the Local Variance Gamma model originally proposed by P. Carr in 2008, and then further elaborated on by Carr and Nadtochiy, 2017 (CN2017), and Carr and Itkin, 2018 (CI2018). As compared with the latest version of the model developed in CI2018 and called the ELVG (the Expanded Local Variance Gamma model), here we provide two innovations. First, in all previous papers the model was constructed based on a Gamma time-changed {\\it arithmetic} Brownian motion: with no drift in CI2017, and with drift in CI2018, and the local variance to be a function of the spot level only. In contrast, here we develop a {\\it geometric} version of this model with drift. Second, in CN2017 the model was calibrated to option smiles assuming the local variance is a piecewise constant function of strike, while in CI2018 the local variance is a piecewise linear} function of strike. In this paper we consider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike, the local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a function of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of strike). We show that for all these new constructions it is still possible to derive an ordinary differential equation for the option price, which plays a role of Dupire's equation for the standard local volatility model, and, moreover, it can be solved in closed form. Finally, similar to CI2018, we show that given multiple smiles the whole local variance/volatility surface can be recovered which does not require solving any optimization problem. Instead, it can be done term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations for each maturity which is fast.", "published": "2018-09-19 16:05:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07727v2", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
