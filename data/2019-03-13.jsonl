{"title": "MMKG: Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs", "abstract": "We present MMKG, a collection of three knowledge graphs that contain both numerical features and (links to) images for all entities as well as entity alignments between pairs of KGs. Therefore, multi-relational link prediction and entity matching communities can benefit from this resource. We believe this data set has the potential to facilitate the development of novel multi-modal learning approaches for knowledge graphs.We validate the utility ofMMKG in the sameAs link prediction task with an extensive set of experiments. These experiments show that the task at hand benefits from learning of multiple feature types.", "published": "2019-03-13 13:48:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05485v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "A polynomial version of Cereceda's conjecture", "abstract": "Let $k$ and $d$ be such that $k \\ge d+2$. Consider two $k$-colourings of a $d$-degenerate graph $G$. Can we transform one into the other by recolouring one vertex at each step while maintaining a proper coloring at any step? Cereceda et al. answered that question in the affirmative, and exhibited a recolouring sequence of exponential length. However, Cereceda conjectured that there should exist one of quadratic length.\n  The $k$-reconfiguration graph of $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the proper $k$-colourings of $G$, with an edge between two colourings if they differ on exactly one vertex. Cereceda's conjecture can be reformulated as follows: the diameter of the $(d+2)$-reconfiguration graph of any $d$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices is $O(n^2)$. So far, the existence of a polynomial diameter is open even for $d=2$.\n  In this paper, we prove that the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph of a $d$-degenerate graph is $O(n^{d+1})$ for $k \\ge d+2$. Moreover, we prove that if $k \\ge \\frac 32 (d+1)$ then the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph is quadratic, improving the previous bound of $k \\ge 2d+1$. We also show that the $5$-reconfiguration graph of planar bipartite graphs has quadratic diameter, confirming Cereceda's conjecture for this class of graphs.", "published": "2019-03-13 17:34:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05619v1", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Low-rankness of Complex-valued Spectrogram and Its Application to Phase-aware Audio Processing", "abstract": "Low-rankness of amplitude spectrograms has been effectively utilized in audio signal processing methods including non-negative matrix factorization. However, such methods have a fundamental limitation owing to their amplitude-only treatment where the phase of the observed signal is utilized for resynthesizing the estimated signal. In order to address this limitation, we directly treat a complex-valued spectrogram and show a complex-valued spectrogram of a sum of sinusoids can be approximately low-rank by modifying its phase. For evaluating the applicability of the proposed low-rank representation, we further propose a convex prior emphasizing harmonic signals, and it is applied to audio denoising.", "published": "2019-03-13 17:06:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05603v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
