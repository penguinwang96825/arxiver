{"title": "Evaluation and Ranking of Machine Translated Output in Hindi Language\n  using Precision and Recall Oriented Metrics", "abstract": "Evaluation plays a crucial role in development of Machine translation\nsystems. In order to judge the quality of an existing MT system i.e. if the\ntranslated output is of human translation quality or not, various automatic\nmetrics exist. We here present the implementation results of different metrics\nwhen used on Hindi language along with their comparisons, illustrating how\neffective are these metrics on languages like Hindi (free word order language).", "published": "2014-04-07 16:45:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1847v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Polish and English wordnets -- statistical analysis of interconnected\n  networks", "abstract": "Wordnets are semantic networks containing nouns, verbs, adjectives, and\nadverbs organized according to linguistic principles, by means of semantic\nrelations. In this work, we adopt a complex network perspective to perform a\ncomparative analysis of the English and Polish wordnets. We determine their\nsimilarities and show that the networks exhibit some of the typical\ncharacteristics observed in other real-world networks. We analyse interlingual\nrelations between both wordnets and deliberate over the problem of mapping the\nPolish lexicon onto the English one.", "published": "2014-04-07 19:23:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1890v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
