{"title": "Impulse Control of a Diffusion with a Change Point", "abstract": "This paper solves a Bayes sequential impulse control problem for a diffusion, whose drift has an unobservable parameter with a change point. The partially-observed problem is reformulated into one with full observations, via a change of probability measure which removes the drift. The optimal impulse controls can be expressed in terms of the solutions and the current values of a Markov process adapted to the observation filtration. We shall illustrate the application of our results using the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm for multiple optimal stopping times in a geometric Brownian motion stock price model with drift uncertainty.", "published": "2014-04-07 12:25:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1761v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
