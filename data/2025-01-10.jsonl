{"title": "Heath-Jarrow-Morton meet lifted Heston in energy markets for joint historical and implied calibration", "abstract": "In energy markets, joint historical and implied calibration is of paramount\nimportance for practitioners yet notoriously challenging due to the need to\nalign historical correlations of futures contracts with implied volatility\nsmiles from the option market. We address this crucial problem with a\nparsimonious multiplicative multi-factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model for\nforward curves, combined with a stochastic volatility factor coming from the\nLifted Heston model. We develop a sequential fast calibration procedure\nleveraging the Kemna-Vorst approximation of futures contracts: (i) historical\ncorrelations and the Variance Swap (VS) volatility term structure are captured\nthrough Level, Slope, and Curvature factors, (ii) the VS volatility term\nstructure can then be corrected for a perfect match via a fixed-point\nalgorithm, (iii) implied volatility smiles are calibrated using Fourier-based\ntechniques. Our model displays remarkable joint historical and implied\ncalibration fits - to both German power and TTF gas markets - and enables\nrealistic interpolation within the implied volatility hypercube.", "published": "2025-01-10 14:00:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05975v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.CP", "91G20, 91G60"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Optimal Insurance under Endogenous Default and Background Risk", "abstract": "This paper studies an optimal insurance problem for a utility-maximizing\nbuyer of insurance, subject to the seller's endogenous default and background\nrisk. An endogenous default occurs when the buyer's contractual indemnity\nexceeds the seller's available reserve, which is random due to the background\nrisk. We obtain an analytical solution to the optimal contract for two types of\ncontracts, differentiated by whether their indemnity functions depend on the\nseller's background risk. The results shed light on the joint effect of the\nseller's default and background risk on the buyer's insurance demand.", "published": "2025-01-10 02:45:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05672v1", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "A Modern Paradigm for Algorithmic Trading", "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for developing fully-automated trading model\nalgorithms. Unlike the traditional approach, which is grounded in analytical\ncomplexity favored by most quantitative analysts, we propose a paradigm shift\nthat embraces real-world complexity. This approach leverages key concepts\nrelating to self-organization, emergence, complex systems theory, scaling laws,\nand utilizes an event-based reframing of time. In closing, we describe an\nexample algorithm that incorporates the outlined elements, called the Delta\nEngine.", "published": "2025-01-10 15:11:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06032v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
