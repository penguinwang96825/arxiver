{"title": "StructSum: Summarization via Structured Representations", "abstract": "Abstractive text summarization aims at compressing the information of a long\nsource document into a rephrased, condensed summary. Despite advances in\nmodeling techniques, abstractive summarization models still suffer from several\nkey challenges: (i) layout bias: they overfit to the style of training corpora;\n(ii) limited abstractiveness: they are optimized to copying n-grams from the\nsource rather than generating novel abstractive summaries; (iii) lack of\ntransparency: they are not interpretable. In this work, we propose a framework\nbased on document-level structure induction for summarization to address these\nchallenges. To this end, we propose incorporating latent and explicit\ndependencies across sentences in the source document into end-to-end\nsingle-document summarization models. Our framework complements standard\nencoder-decoder summarization models by augmenting them with rich\nstructure-aware document representations based on implicitly learned (latent)\nstructures and externally-derived linguistic (explicit) structures. We show\nthat our summarization framework, trained on the CNN/DM dataset, improves the\ncoverage of content in the source documents, generates more abstractive\nsummaries by generating more novel n-grams, and incorporates interpretable\nsentence-level structures, while performing on par with standard baselines.", "published": "2020-03-01 20:32:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00576v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Environment-agnostic Multitask Learning for Natural Language Grounded\n  Navigation", "abstract": "Recent research efforts enable study for natural language grounded navigation\nin photo-realistic environments, e.g., following natural language instructions\nor dialog. However, existing methods tend to overfit training data in seen\nenvironments and fail to generalize well in previously unseen environments. To\nclose the gap between seen and unseen environments, we aim at learning a\ngeneralized navigation model from two novel perspectives: (1) we introduce a\nmultitask navigation model that can be seamlessly trained on both\nVision-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH)\ntasks, which benefits from richer natural language guidance and effectively\ntransfers knowledge across tasks; (2) we propose to learn environment-agnostic\nrepresentations for the navigation policy that are invariant among the\nenvironments seen during training, thus generalizing better on unseen\nenvironments. Extensive experiments show that environment-agnostic multitask\nlearning significantly reduces the performance gap between seen and unseen\nenvironments, and the navigation agent trained so outperforms baselines on\nunseen environments by 16% (relative measure on success rate) on VLN and 120%\n(goal progress) on NDH. Our submission to the CVDN leaderboard establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art for the NDH task on the holdout test set.

{"title": "Harmonics Based Representation in Clarinet Tone Quality Evaluation", "abstract": "Music tone quality evaluation is generally performed by experts. It could be\nsubjective and short of consistency and fairness as well as time-consuming. In\nthis paper we present a new method for identifying the clarinet reed quality by\nevaluating tone quality based on the harmonic structure and energy\ndistribution. We first decouple the quality of reed and clarinet pipe based on\nthe acoustic harmonics, and discover that the reed quality is strongly relevant\nto the even parts of the harmonics. Then we construct a features set consisting\nof the even harmonic envelope and the energy distribution of harmonics in\nspectrum. The annotated clarinet audio data are recorded from 3 levels of\nperformers and the tone quality is classified by machine learning. The results\nshow that our new method for identifying low and medium high tones\nsignificantly outperforms previous methods.", "published": "2020-03-01 06:06:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00414v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.MM", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
