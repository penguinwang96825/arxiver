{"title": "Distance Metric Learning for Aspect Phrase Grouping", "abstract": "Aspect phrase grouping is an important task in aspect-level sentiment\nanalysis. It is a challenging problem due to polysemy and context dependency.\nWe propose an Attention-based Deep Distance Metric Learning (ADDML) method, by\nconsidering aspect phrase representation as well as context representation.\nFirst, leveraging the characteristics of the review text, we automatically\ngenerate aspect phrase sample pairs for distant supervision. Second, we feed\nword embeddings of aspect phrases and their contexts into an attention-based\nneural network to learn feature representation of contexts. Both aspect phrase\nembedding and context embedding are used to learn a deep feature subspace for\nmeasure the distances between aspect phrases for K-means clustering.\nExperiments on four review datasets show that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art strong baseline methods.", "published": "2016-04-29 02:44:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08672v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Teaching natural language to computers", "abstract": "\"Natural Language,\" whether spoken and attended to by humans, or processed\nand generated by computers, requires networked structures that reflect creative\nprocesses in semantic, syntactic, phonetic, linguistic, social, emotional, and\ncultural modules. Being able to produce novel and useful behavior following\nrepeated practice gets to the root of both artificial intelligence and human\nlanguage.
