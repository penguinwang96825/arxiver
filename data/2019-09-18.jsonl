{"title": "Limited-budget output consensus for descriptor multiagent systems with energy constraints", "abstract": "The current paper deals with limited-budget output consensus for descriptor multiagent systems with two types of switching communication topologies; that is, switching connected ones and jointly connected ones. Firstly, a singular dynamic output feedback control protocol with switching communication topologies is proposed on the basis of the observable decomposition, where an energy constraint is involved and protocol states of neighboring agents are utilized to derive a new two-step design approach of gain matrices. Then, limited-budget output consensus problems are transformed into asymptotic stability ones and a valid candidate of the output consensus function is determined. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for limited-budget output consensus design for two types of switching communication topologies are proposed, respectively. Finally, two numerical simulations are shown to demonstrate theoretical conclusions.", "published": "2019-09-18 10:43:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08345v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
