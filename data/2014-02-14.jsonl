{"title": "An evaluative baseline for geo-semantic relatedness and similarity", "abstract": "In geographic information science and semantics, the computation of semantic\nsimilarity is widely recognised as key to supporting a vast number of tasks in\ninformation integration and retrieval. By contrast, the role of geo-semantic\nrelatedness has been largely ignored. In natural language processing, semantic\nrelatedness is often confused with the more specific semantic similarity. In\nthis article, we discuss a notion of geo-semantic relatedness based on Lehrer's\nsemantic fields, and we compare it with geo-semantic similarity. We then\ndescribe and validate the Geo Relatedness and Similarity Dataset (GeReSiD), a\nnew open dataset designed to evaluate computational measures of geo-semantic\nrelatedness and similarity. This dataset is larger than existing datasets of\nthis kind, and includes 97 geographic terms combined into 50 term pairs rated\nby 203 human subjects. GeReSiD is available online and can be used as an\nevaluation baseline to determine empirically to what degree a given\ncomputational model approximates geo-semantic relatedness and similarity.", "published": "2014-02-14 06:06:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3371v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Machine Learning of Phonologically Conditioned Noun Declensions For\n  Tamil Morphological Generators", "abstract": "This paper presents machine learning solutions to a practical problem of\nNatural Language Generation (NLG), particularly the word formation in\nagglutinative languages like Tamil, in a supervised manner. The morphological\ngenerator is an important component of Natural Language Processing in\nArtificial Intelligence. It generates word forms given a root and affixes. The\nmorphophonemic changes like addition, deletion, alternation etc., occur when\ntwo or more morphemes or words joined together. The Sandhi rules should be\nexplicitly specified in the rule based morphological analyzers and generators.\nIn machine learning framework, these rules can be learned automatically by the\nsystem from the training samples and subsequently be applied for new inputs. In\nthis paper we proposed the machine learning models which learn the\nmorphophonemic rules for noun declensions from the given training data. These\nmodels are trained to learn sandhi rules using various learning algorithms and\nthe performance of those algorithms are presented. From this we conclude that\nmachine learning of morphological processing such as word form generation can\nbe successfully learned in a supervised manner, without explicit description of\nrules. The performance of Decision trees and Bayesian machine learning\nalgorithms on noun declensions are discussed.", "published": "2014-02-14 06:46:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3382v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Authorship Analysis based on Data Compression", "abstract": "This paper proposes to perform authorship analysis using the Fast Compression\nDistance (FCD), a similarity measure based on compression with dictionaries\ndirectly extracted from the written texts. The FCD computes a similarity\nbetween two documents through an effective binary search on the intersection\nset between the two related dictionaries. In the reported experiments the\nproposed method is applied to documents which are heterogeneous in style,\nwritten in five different languages and coming from different historical\nperiods. Results are comparable to the state of the art and outperform\ntraditional compression-based methods.", "published": "2014-02-14 09:25:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3405v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL", "cs.IR", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
