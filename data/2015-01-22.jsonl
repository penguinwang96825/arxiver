{"title": "Deep Multimodal Learning for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition", "abstract": "In this paper, we present methods in deep multimodal learning for fusing\nspeech and visual modalities for Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition\n(AV-ASR). First, we study an approach where uni-modal deep networks are trained\nseparately and their final hidden layers fused to obtain a joint feature space\nin which another deep network is built. While the audio network alone achieves\na phone error rate (PER) of $41\\%$ under clean condition on the IBM large\nvocabulary audio-visual studio dataset, this fusion model achieves a PER of\n$35.83\\%$ demonstrating the tremendous value of the visual channel in phone\nclassification even in audio with high signal to noise ratio. Second, we\npresent a new deep network architecture that uses a bilinear softmax layer to\naccount for class specific correlations between modalities. We show that\ncombining the posteriors from the bilinear networks with those from the fused\nmodel mentioned above results in a further significant phone error rate\nreduction, yielding a final PER of $34.03\\%$.", "published": "2015-01-22 05:25:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05396v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A New Efficient Method for Calculating Similarity Between Web Services", "abstract": "Web services allow communication between heterogeneous systems in a\ndistributed environment. Their enormous success and their increased use led to\nthe fact that thousands of Web services are present on the Internet. This\nsignificant number of Web services which not cease to increase has led to\nproblems of the difficulty in locating and classifying web services, these\nproblems are encountered mainly during the operations of web services discovery\nand substitution. Traditional ways of search based on keywords are not\nsuccessful in this context, their results do not support the structure of Web\nservices and they consider in their search only the identifiers of the web\nservice description language (WSDL) interface elements. The methods based on\nsemantics (WSDLS, OWLS, SAWSDL...) which increase the WSDL description of a Web\nservice with a semantic description allow raising partially this problem, but\ntheir complexity and difficulty delays their adoption in real cases. Measuring\nthe similarity between the web services interfaces is the most suitable\nsolution for this kind of problems, it will classify available web services so\nas to know those that best match the searched profile and those that do not\nmatch. Thus, the main goal of this work is to study the degree of similarity\nbetween any two web services by offering a new method that is more effective\nthan existing works.", "published": "2015-01-22 22:18:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05940v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SE", "D.1.3; D.2.12; D.3.1; H.3.5"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
