{"title": "Semi-Automatic Data Annotation, POS Tagging and Mildly Context-Sensitive\n  Disambiguation: the eXtended Revised AraMorph (XRAM)", "abstract": "An extended, revised form of Tim Buckwalter's Arabic lexical and\nmorphological resource AraMorph, eXtended Revised AraMorph (henceforth XRAM),\nis presented which addresses a number of weaknesses and inconsistencies of the\noriginal model by allowing a wider coverage of real-world Classical and\ncontemporary (both formal and informal) Arabic texts. Building upon previous\nresearch, XRAM enhancements include (i) flag-selectable usage markers, (ii)\nprobabilistic mildly context-sensitive POS tagging, filtering, disambiguation\nand ranking of alternative morphological analyses, (iii) semi-automatic\nincrement of lexical coverage through extraction of lexical and morphological\ninformation from existing lexical resources. Testing of XRAM through a\nfront-end Python module showed a remarkable success level.", "published": "2016-03-06 14:12:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01833v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
