{"title": "A Non-Asymptotic Framework for Approximate Message Passing in Spiked Models", "abstract": "Approximate message passing (AMP) emerges as an effective iterative paradigm for solving high-dimensional statistical problems. However, prior AMP theory -- which focused mostly on high-dimensional asymptotics -- fell short of predicting the AMP dynamics when the number of iterations surpasses $o\\big(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\big)$ (with $n$ the problem dimension). To address this inadequacy, this paper develops a non-asymptotic framework for understanding AMP in spiked matrix estimation. Built upon new decomposition of AMP updates and controllable residual terms, we lay out an analysis recipe to characterize the finite-sample behavior of AMP in the presence of an independent initialization, which is further generalized to allow for spectral initialization. As two concrete consequences of the proposed analysis recipe: (i) when solving $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, we predict the behavior of spectrally initialized AMP for up to $O\\big(\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{poly}\\log n}\\big)$ iterations, showing that the algorithm succeeds without the need of a subsequent refinement stage (as conjectured recently by \\citet{celentano2021local}); (ii) we characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of AMP in sparse PCA (in the spiked Wigner model) for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratio.", "published": "2022-08-05 17:59:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03313v2", "categories": ["math.ST", "cs.IT", "cs.LG", "eess.SP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "math.ST"}
