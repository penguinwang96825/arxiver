{"title": "Addressing Artificial Intelligence Bias in Retinal Disease Diagnostics", "abstract": "This study evaluated generative methods to potentially mitigate AI bias when diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) resulting from training data imbalance, or domain generalization which occurs when deep learning systems (DLS) face concepts at test/inference time they were not initially trained on. The public domain Kaggle-EyePACS dataset (88,692 fundi and 44,346 individuals, originally diverse for ethnicity) was modified by adding clinician-annotated labels and constructing an artificial scenario of data imbalance and domain generalization by disallowing training (but not testing) exemplars for images of retinas with DR warranting referral (DR-referable) and from darker-skin individuals, who presumably have greater concentration of melanin within uveal melanocytes, on average, contributing to retinal image pigmentation. A traditional/baseline diagnostic DLS was compared against new DLSs that would use training data augmented via generative models for debiasing. Accuracy (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of the baseline diagnostics DLS for fundus images of lighter-skin individuals was 73.0% (66.9%, 79.2%) vs. darker-skin of 60.5% (53.5%, 67.3%), demonstrating bias/disparity (delta=12.5%) (Welch t-test t=2.670, P=.008) in AI performance across protected subpopulations. Using novel generative methods for addressing missing subpopulation training data (DR-referable darker-skin) achieved instead accuracy, for lighter-skin, of 72.0% (65.8%, 78.2%), and for darker-skin, of 71.5% (65.2%,77.8%), demonstrating closer parity (delta=0.5%) in accuracy across subpopulations (Welch t-test t=0.111, P=.912). Findings illustrate how data imbalance and domain generalization can lead to disparity of accuracy across subpopulations, and show that novel generative methods of synthetic fundus images may play a role for debiasing AI.", "published": "2020-04-28 13:46:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13515v4", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CV", "eess.IV"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Augmented Behavioral Cloning from Observation", "abstract": "Imitation from observation is a computational technique that teaches an agent on how to mimic the behavior of an expert by observing only the sequence of states from the expert demonstrations. Recent approaches learn the inverse dynamics of the environment and an imitation policy by interleaving epochs of both models while changing the demonstration data. However, such approaches often get stuck into sub-optimal solutions that are distant from the expert, limiting their imitation effectiveness. We address this problem with a novel approach that overcomes the problem of reaching bad local minima by exploring: (I) a self-attention mechanism that better captures global features of the states; and (ii) a sampling strategy that regulates the observations that are used for learning. We show empirically that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in four different environments by a large margin.", "published": "2020-04-28 13:56:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13529v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

{"title": "A Method for Vehicle Collision Risk Assessment through Inferring Driver's Braking Actions in Near-Crash Situations", "abstract": "Driving information and data under potential vehicle crashes create opportunities for extensive real-world observations of driver behaviors and relevant factors that significantly influence the driving safety in emergency scenarios. Furthermore, the availability of such data also enhances the collision avoidance systems (CASs) by evaluating driver's actions in near-crash scenarios and providing timely warnings. These applications motivate the need for heuristic tools capable of inferring relationship among driving risk, driver/vehicle characteristics, and road environment. In this paper, we acquired amount of real-world driving data and built a comprehensive dataset, which contains multiple \"driver-vehicle-road\" attributes. The proposed method works in two steps. In the first step, a variable precision rough set (VPRS) based classification technique is applied to draw a reduced core subset from field driving dataset, which presents the essential attributes set most relevant to driving safety assessment. In the second step, we design a decision strategy by introducing mutual information entropy to quantify the significance of each attribute, then a representative index through accumulation of weighted \"driver-vehicle-road\" factors is calculated to reflect the driving risk for actual situation. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in an offline analysis of the driving data collected in field trials, where the aim is to infer the emergency braking actions in next short term. The results indicate that our proposed model is a good alternative for providing improved warnings in real-time because of its high prediction accuracy and stability.", "published": "2020-04-28 18:17:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13761v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Mobile Energy Transfer in Internet of Things", "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) is powering up smart cities by connecting all kinds of electronic devices. The power supply problem of IoT devices constitutes a major challenge in current IoT development, due to the poor battery endurance as well as the troublesome cable deployment. The wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has recently emerged as a promising solution. Yet, existing WPT advances cannot support free and mobile charging like Wi-Fi communications. To this end, the concept of mobile energy transfer (MET) is proposed, which relies critically on an resonant beam charging (RBC) technology. The adaptive (A) RBC technology builds on RBC, but aims at improving the charging efficiency by charging devices at device preferred current and voltage levels adaptively. A mobile ARBC scheme is developed relying on an adaptive source power control. Extensive numerical simulations using a 1,000mAh Li-ion battery show that the mobile ARBC outperforms simple charging schemes such as the constant power charging, the profile-adaptive charging, and the distance-adaptive charging in saving energy.", "published": "2020-04-28 10:19:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13404v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Benchmarking LiDAR Sensors for Development and Evaluation of Automotive Perception", "abstract": "Environment perception and representation are some of the most critical tasks in automated driving. To meet the stringent needs of safety standards such as ISO 26262 there is a need for efficient quantitative evaluation of the perceived information. However, to use typical methods of evaluation, such as comparing using annotated data, is not scalable due to the manual effort involved.\n  There is thus a need to automate the process of data annotation. This paper focuses on the LiDAR sensor and aims to identify the limitations of the sensor and provides a methodology to generate annotated data of a measurable quality. The limitations with the sensor are analysed in a Systematic Literature Review on available academic texts and refined by unstructured interviews with experts.\n  The main contributions are 1) the SLR with related interviews to identify LiDAR sensor limitations and 2) the associated methodology which allows us to generate world representations.", "published": "2020-04-28 11:28:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13433v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "eess.SY"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
