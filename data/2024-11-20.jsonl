{"title": "Simulating Liquidity: Agent-Based Modeling of Illiquid Markets for Fractional Ownership", "abstract": "This research investigates liquidity dynamics in fractional ownership\nmarkets, focusing on illiquid alternative investments traded on a FinTech\nplatform. By leveraging empirical data and employing agent-based modeling\n(ABM), the study simulates trading behaviors in sell offer-driven systems,\nproviding a foundation for generating insights into how different market\nstructures influence liquidity. The ABM-based simulation model provides a data\naugmentation environment which allows for the exploration of diverse trading\narchitectures and rules, offering an alternative to direct experimentation.\nThis approach bridges academic theory and practical application, supported by\ncollaboration with industry and Swiss federal funding. The paper lays the\nfoundation for planned extensions, including the identification of a\nliquidity-maximizing trading environment and the design of a market maker, by\nsimulating the current functioning of the investment platform using an ABM\nspecified with empirical data.", "published": "2024-11-20 15:07:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13381v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
