{"title": "Path weighting sensitivities", "abstract": "In this paper, we study the computation of sensitivities with respect to spot\nof path dependent financial derivatives by means of path weighting. We propose\nexplicit path weighting formula and variance reduction adjustment in order to\naddress the large variance happening when the first simulation time step is\nsmall. We also propose a covariance inflation technique to addresses the\ndegenerator case when the covariance matrix is singular. The stock dynamics we\nconsider is given in a general functional form, which includes the classical\nBlack-Scholes model, the implied distribution model, and the local volatility\nmodel.", "published": "2024-11-20 15:43:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13403v1", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
{"title": "A Deep Learning Approach to Predict the Fall [of Price] of Cryptocurrency Long Before its Actual Fall", "abstract": "In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly\nrising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more\nvolatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign\nexchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain\ncondition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the\nmagnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also\ncalled volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the\ncryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they\nexperience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the\ncryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the\ncryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different\nmachine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the\nmodels have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model\nhas been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed\nmodel gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of\n0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in\ncomplicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin,\netc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the\nlower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with\nproper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to\ntrade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum,\nand Dogecoin.", "published": "2024-11-20 08:09:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13615v3", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Simulating Liquidity: Agent-Based Modeling of Illiquid Markets for Fractional Ownership", "abstract": "This research investigates liquidity dynamics in fractional ownership\nmarkets, focusing on illiquid alternative investments traded on a FinTech\nplatform. By leveraging empirical data and employing agent-based modeling\n(ABM), the study simulates trading behaviors in sell offer-driven systems,\nproviding a foundation for generating insights into how different market\nstructures influence liquidity. The ABM-based simulation model provides a data\naugmentation environment which allows for the exploration of diverse trading\narchitectures and rules, offering an alternative to direct experimentation.\nThis approach bridges academic theory and practical application, supported by\ncollaboration with industry and Swiss federal funding. The paper lays the\nfoundation for planned extensions, including the identification of a\nliquidity-maximizing trading environment and the design of a market maker, by\nsimulating the current functioning of the investment platform using an ABM\nspecified with empirical data.", "published": "2024-11-20 15:07:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13381v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
