{"title": "Clustering and Relational Ambiguity: from Text Data to Natural Data", "abstract": "Text data is often seen as \"take-away\" materials with little noise and easy\nto process information. Main questions are how to get data and transform them\ninto a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called\nambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is\nobvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in\nthis paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation.\nIn this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data\nthemselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified\nbut meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions\nand background noise.", "published": "2013-11-21 13:47:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5401v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
