{"title": "Basic tasks of sentiment analysis", "abstract": "Subjectivity detection is the task of identifying objective and subjective\nsentences. Objective sentences are those which do not exhibit any sentiment.\nSo, it is desired for a sentiment analysis engine to find and separate the\nobjective sentences for further analysis, e.g., polarity detection. In\nsubjective sentences, opinions can often be expressed on one or multiple\ntopics. Aspect extraction is a subtask of sentiment analysis that consists in\nidentifying opinion targets in opinionated text, i.e., in detecting the\nspecific aspects of a product or service the opinion holder is either praising\nor complaining about.", "published": "2017-10-18 00:26:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06536v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Towards a Seamless Integration of Word Senses into Downstream NLP\n  Applications", "abstract": "Lexical ambiguity can impede NLP systems from accurate understanding of\nsemantics. Despite its potential benefits, the integration of sense-level\ninformation into NLP systems has remained understudied. By incorporating a\nnovel disambiguation algorithm into a state-of-the-art classification model, we\ncreate a pipeline to integrate sense-level information into downstream NLP\napplications. We show that a simple disambiguation of the input text can lead\nto consistent performance improvement on multiple topic categorization and\npolarity detection datasets, particularly when the fine granularity of the\nunderlying sense inventory is reduced and the document is sufficiently large.\nOur results also point to the need for sense representation research to focus\nmore on in vivo evaluations which target the performance in downstream NLP\napplications rather than artificial benchmarks.", "published": "2017-10-18 09:13:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06632v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Representation Learning of Music Using Artist Labels", "abstract": "In music domain, feature learning has been conducted mainly in two ways:\nunsupervised learning based on sparse representations or supervised learning by\nsemantic labels such as music genre. However, finding discriminative features\nin an unsupervised way is challenging and supervised feature learning using\nsemantic labels may involve noisy or expensive annotation. In this paper, we\npresent a supervised feature learning approach using artist labels annotated in\nevery single track as objective meta data. We propose two deep convolutional\nneural networks (DCNN) to learn the deep artist features. One is a plain DCNN\ntrained with the whole artist labels simultaneously, and the other is a Siamese\nDCNN trained with a subset of the artist labels based on the artist identity.\nWe apply the trained models to music classification and retrieval tasks in\ntransfer learning settings. The results show that our approach is comparable to\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, indicating that the proposed approach\ncaptures general music audio features as much as the models learned with\nsemantic labels. Also, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two\nmodels.", "published": "2017-10-18 09:42:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06648v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
