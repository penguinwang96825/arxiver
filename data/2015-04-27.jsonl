{"title": "Exploring semantically-related concepts from Wikipedia: the case of SeRE", "abstract": "In this paper we present our web application SeRE designed to explore\nsemantically related concepts. Wikipedia and DBpedia are rich data sources to\nextract related entities for a given topic, like in- and out-links, broader and\nnarrower terms, categorisation information etc. We use the Wikipedia full text\nbody to compute the semantic relatedness for extracted terms, which results in\na list of entities that are most relevant for a topic. For any given query, the\nuser interface of SeRE visualizes these related concepts, ordered by semantic\nrelatedness; with snippets from Wikipedia articles that explain the connection\nbetween those two entities. In a user study we examine how SeRE can be used to\nfind important entities and their relationships for a given topic and to answer\nthe question of how the classification system can be used for filtering.", "published": "2015-04-27 13:08:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07071v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Concept Extraction to Identify Adverse Drug Reactions in Medical Forums:\n  A Comparison of Algorithms", "abstract": "Social media is becoming an increasingly important source of information to\ncomplement traditional pharmacovigilance methods. In order to identify signals\nof potential adverse drug reactions, it is necessary to first identify medical\nconcepts in the social media text. Most of the existing studies use\ndictionary-based methods which are not evaluated independently from the overall\nsignal detection task.\n  We compare different approaches to automatically identify and normalise\nmedical concepts in consumer reviews in medical forums. Specifically, we\nimplement several dictionary-based methods popular in the relevant literature,\nas well as a method we suggest based on a state-of-the-art machine learning\nmethod for entity recognition. MetaMap, a popular biomedical concept extraction\ntool, is used as a baseline. Our evaluations were performed in a controlled\nsetting on a common corpus which is a collection of medical forum posts\nannotated with concepts and linked to controlled vocabularies such as MedDRA\nand SNOMED CT.\n  To our knowledge, our study is the first to systematically examine the effect\nof popular concept extraction methods in the area of signal detection for\nadverse reactions. We show that the choice of algorithm or controlled\nvocabulary has a significant impact on concept extraction, which will impact\nthe overall signal detection process. We also show that our proposed machine\nlearning approach significantly outperforms all the other methods in\nidentification of both adverse reactions and drugs, even when trained with a\nrelatively small set of annotated text.", "published": "2015-04-27 05:56:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06936v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Correlational Neural Networks", "abstract": "Common Representation Learning (CRL), wherein different descriptions (or\nviews) of the data are embedded in a common subspace, is receiving a lot of\nattention recently. Two popular paradigms here are Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (CCA) based approaches and Autoencoder (AE) based approaches. CCA\nbased approaches learn a joint representation by maximizing correlation of the\nviews when projected to the common subspace. AE based methods learn a common\nrepresentation by minimizing the error of reconstructing the two views. Each of\nthese approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, while\nCCA based approaches outperform AE based approaches for the task of transfer\nlearning, they are not as scalable as the latter. In this work we propose an AE\nbased approach called Correlational Neural Network (CorrNet), that explicitly\nmaximizes correlation among the views when projected to the common subspace.\nThrough a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed CorrNet is\nbetter than the above mentioned approaches with respect to its ability to learn\ncorrelated common representations. Further, we employ CorrNet for several cross\nlanguage tasks and show that the representations learned using CorrNet perform\nbetter than the ones learned using other state of the art approaches.", "published": "2015-04-27 19:51:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07225v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Document Classification by Inversion of Distributed Language\n  Representations", "abstract": "There have been many recent advances in the structure and measurement of\ndistributed language models: those that map from words to a vector-space that\nis rich in information about word choice and composition. This vector-space is\nthe distributed language representation. The goal of this note is to point out\nthat any distributed representation can be turned into a classifier through\ninversion via Bayes rule. The approach is simple and modular, in that it will\nwork with any language representation whose training can be formulated as\noptimizing a probability model. In our application to 2 million sentences from\nYelp reviews, we also find that it performs as well as or better than complex\npurpose-built algorithms.", "published": "2015-04-27 22:32:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07295v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "On a Possible Similarity between Gene and Semantic Networks", "abstract": "In several domains such as linguistics, molecular biology or social sciences,\nholistic effects are hardly well-defined by modeling with single units, but\nmore and more studies tend to understand macro structures with the help of\nmeaningful and useful associations in fields such as social networks, systems\nbiology or semantic web. A stochastic multi-agent system offers both accurate\ntheoretical framework and operational computing implementations to model\nlarge-scale associations, their dynamics and patterns extraction. We show that\nclustering around a target object in a set of associations of object prove some\nsimilarity in specific data and two case studies about gene-gene and term-term\nrelationships leading to an idea of a common organizing principle of cognition\nwith random and deterministic effects.", "published": "2015-04-27 11:24:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00414v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CE", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
