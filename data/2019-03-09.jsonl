{"title": "Fine Properties of the Optimal Skorokhod Embedding Problem", "abstract": "We study the problem of stopping a Brownian motion at a given distribution $\u03bd$ while optimizing a reward function that depends on the (possibly randomized) stopping time and the Brownian motion. Our first result establishes that the set $\\mathcal{T}(\u03bd)$ of stopping times embedding $\u03bd$ is weakly dense in the set $\\mathcal{R}(\u03bd)$ of randomized embeddings. In particular, the optimal Skorokhod embedding problem over $\\mathcal{T}(\u03bd)$ has the same value as the relaxed one over $\\mathcal{R}(\u03bd)$ when the reward function is semicontinuous, which parallels a fundamental result about Monge maps and Kantorovich couplings in optimal transport. A second part studies the dual optimization in the sense of linear programming. While existence of a dual solution failed in previous formulations, we introduce a relaxation of the dual problem that exploits a novel compactness property and yields existence of solutions as well as absence of a duality gap, even for irregular reward functions. This leads to a monotonicity principle which complements the key theorem of Beiglb\u00f6ck, Cox and Huesmann [Optimal transport and Skorokhod embedding, Invent. Math., 208:327-400, 2017]. We show that these results can be applied to characterize the geometry of optimal embeddings through a variational condition.", "published": "2019-03-09 23:14:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03887v2", "categories": ["math.PR", "math.OC", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
