{"title": "Rookie: A unique approach for exploring news archives", "abstract": "News archives are an invaluable primary source for placing current events in\nhistorical context. But current search engine tools do a poor job at uncovering\nbroad themes and narratives across documents. We present Rookie: a practical\nsoftware system which uses natural language processing (NLP) to help readers,\nreporters and editors uncover broad stories in news archives. Unlike prior\nwork, Rookie's design emerged from 18 months of iterative development in\nconsultation with editors and computational journalists. This process lead to a\ndramatically different approach from previous academic systems with similar\ngoals. Our efforts offer a generalizable case study for others building\nreal-world journalism software using NLP.", "published": "2017-08-06 22:20:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01944v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
