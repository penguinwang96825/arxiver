{"title": "Basis Identification for Automatic Creation of Pronunciation Lexicon for\n  Proper Names", "abstract": "Development of a proper names pronunciation lexicon is usually a manual\neffort which can not be avoided. Grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion modules,\nin literature, are usually rule based and work best for non-proper names in a\nparticular language. Proper names are foreign to a G2P module. We follow an\noptimization approach to enable automatic construction of proper names\npronunciation lexicon. The idea is to construct a small orthogonal set of words\n(basis) which can span the set of names in a given database. We propose two\nalgorithms for the construction of this basis. The transcription lexicon of all\nthe proper names in a database can be produced by the manual transcription of\nonly the small set of basis words. We first construct a cost function and show\nthat the minimization of the cost function results in a basis. We derive\nconditions for convergence of this cost function and validate them\nexperimentally on a very large proper name database. Experiments show the\ntranscription can be achieved by transcribing a set of small number of basis\nwords. The algorithms proposed are generic and independent of language; however\nperformance is better if the proper names have same origin, namely, same\nlanguage or geographical region.", "published": "2014-06-05 07:07:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1280v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
