{"title": "Morphological Analyzer and Generator for Russian and Ukrainian Languages", "abstract": "pymorphy2 is a morphological analyzer and generator for Russian and Ukrainian\nlanguages. It uses large efficiently encoded lexi- cons built from OpenCorpora\nand LanguageTool data. A set of linguistically motivated rules is developed to\nenable morphological analysis and generation of out-of-vocabulary words\nobserved in real-world documents. For Russian pymorphy2 provides\nstate-of-the-arts morphological analysis quality. The analyzer is implemented\nin Python programming language with optional C++ extensions. Emphasis is put on\nease of use, documentation and extensibility.

{"title": "Using Latent Semantic Analysis to Identify Quality in Use (QU)\n  Indicators from User Reviews", "abstract": "The paper describes a novel approach to categorize users' reviews according\nto the three Quality in Use (QU) indicators defined in ISO: effectiveness,\nefficiency and freedom from risk. With the tremendous amount of reviews\npublished each day, there is a need to automatically summarize user reviews to\ninform us if any of the software able to meet requirement of a company\naccording to the quality requirements. We implemented the method of Latent\nSemantic Analysis (LSA) and its subspace to predict QU indicators. We build a\nreduced dimensionality universal semantic space from Information System\njournals and Amazon reviews. Next, we projected set of indicators' measurement\nscales into the universal semantic space and represent them as subspace. In the\nsubspace, we can map similar measurement scales to the unseen reviews and\npredict the QU indicators. Our preliminary study able to obtain the average of\nF-measure, 0.3627.", "published": "2015-03-25 06:42:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07294v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
