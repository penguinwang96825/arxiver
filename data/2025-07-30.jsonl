Differentially private stochastic\ngradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a\npronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,\ndegrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been\nproposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control\nknobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization\nlandscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy\nbudget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay\nwithin privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP\noptimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep\nreinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the\nlearning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter\ngradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian\nnoise.

{"title": "RLVMR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Meta-Reasoning Rewards for Robust Long-Horizon Agents", "abstract": "The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a\ncentral goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical\nlimitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final\ntask success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem\nwe term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail\nto generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason\ncoherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that\nintegrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding\nverifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag\nits cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and\nprovides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to\neffective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the\nfinal outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.\nOn the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new\nstate-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on\nthe most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem\nfrom improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant\nactions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and\ninterpretable agents.", "published": "2025-07-30 17:00:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22844v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework", "abstract": "Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,\nas even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain\ndegradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding.

{"title": "Comparing Normalizing Flows with Kernel Density Estimation in Estimating Risk of Automated Driving Systems", "abstract": "The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe\ndeployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety.

(1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference.

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue.

We give three methods for solving this problem, each\nattractive in its own way.\n  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive,\nnon-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid.\nDistances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove\nthat the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is\n$(1+1/\\Theta(\\log^\\xi \\log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and\n$\\xi=\\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can\nbe improved quantitatively.\n  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of\n\"highways.\" It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which\nconverges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.\n  * The first two methods are deterministic.
