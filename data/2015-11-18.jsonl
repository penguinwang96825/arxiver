{"title": "Combining Neural Networks and Log-linear Models to Improve Relation\n  Extraction", "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the success of the traditional feature-based\nmethod on exploiting the discrete structures such as words or lexical patterns\nto extract relations from text. Recently, convolutional and recurrent neural\nnetworks has provided very effective mechanisms to capture the hidden\nstructures within sentences via continuous representations, thereby\nsignificantly advancing the performance of relation extraction. The advantage\nof convolutional neural networks is their capacity to generalize the\nconsecutive k-grams in the sentences while recurrent neural networks are\neffective to encode long ranges of sentence context. This paper proposes to\ncombine the traditional feature-based method, the convolutional and recurrent\nneural networks to simultaneously benefit from their advantages. Our systematic\nevaluation of different network architectures and combination methods\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of this approach and results in the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 and SemEval dataset.", "published": "2015-11-18 20:17:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05926v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Segmental Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "We introduce segmental recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) which define, given\nan input sequence, a joint probability distribution over segmentations of the\ninput and labelings of the segments. Representations of the input segments\n(i.e., contiguous subsequences of the input) are computed by encoding their\nconstituent tokens using bidirectional recurrent neural nets, and these\n\"segment embeddings\" are used to define compatibility scores with output\nlabels. These local compatibility scores are integrated using a global\nsemi-Markov conditional random field. Both fully supervised training -- in\nwhich segment boundaries and labels are observed -- as well as partially\nsupervised training -- in which segment boundaries are latent -- are\nstraightforward. Experiments on handwriting recognition and joint Chinese word\nsegmentation/POS tagging show that, compared to models that do not explicitly\nrepresent segments such as BIO tagging schemes and connectionist temporal\nclassification (CTC), SRNNs obtain substantially higher accuracies.", "published": "2015-11-18 23:02:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06018v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Harvesting comparable corpora and mining them for equivalent bilingual\n  sentences using statistical classification and analogy- based heuristics", "abstract": "Parallel sentences are a relatively scarce but extremely useful resource for\nmany applications including cross-lingual retrieval and statistical machine\ntranslation. This research explores our new methodologies for mining such data\nfrom previously obtained comparable corpora. The task is highly practical since\nnon-parallel multilingual data exist in far greater quantities than parallel\ncorpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful resource. Here we\npropose a web crawling method for building subject-aligned comparable corpora\nfrom e.g. Wikipedia dumps and Euronews web page. The improvements in machine\ntranslation are shown on Polish-English language pair for various text domains.\nWe also tested another method of building parallel corpora based on comparable\ncorpora data. It lets automatically broad existing corpus of sentences from\nsubject of corpora based on analogies between them.", "published": "2015-11-18 15:26:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06285v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Image Question Answering using Convolutional Neural Network with Dynamic\n  Parameter Prediction", "abstract": "We tackle image question answering (ImageQA) problem by learning a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) with a dynamic parameter layer whose weights\nare determined adaptively based on questions. For the adaptive parameter\nprediction, we employ a separate parameter prediction network, which consists\nof gated recurrent unit (GRU) taking a question as its input and a\nfully-connected layer generating a set of candidate weights as its output.\nHowever, it is challenging to construct a parameter prediction network for a\nlarge number of parameters in the fully-connected dynamic parameter layer of\nthe CNN. We reduce the complexity of this problem by incorporating a hashing\ntechnique, where the candidate weights given by the parameter prediction\nnetwork are selected using a predefined hash function to determine individual\nweights in the dynamic parameter layer. The proposed network---joint network\nwith the CNN for ImageQA and the parameter prediction network---is trained\nend-to-end through back-propagation, where its weights are initialized using a\npre-trained CNN and GRU. The proposed algorithm illustrates the\nstate-of-the-art performance on all available public ImageQA benchmarks.", "published": "2015-11-18 12:30:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05756v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
