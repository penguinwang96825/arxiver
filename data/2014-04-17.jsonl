{"title": "The First Parallel Multilingual Corpus of Persian: Toward a Persian\n  BLARK", "abstract": "In this article, we have introduced the first parallel corpus of Persian with\nmore than 10 other European languages. This article describes primary steps\ntoward preparing a Basic Language Resources Kit (BLARK) for Persian. Up to now,\nwe have proposed morphosyntactic specification of Persian based on\nEAGLE/MULTEXT guidelines and specific resources of MULTEXT-East. The article\nintroduces Persian Language, with emphasis on its orthography and\nmorphosyntactic features, then a new Part-of-Speech categorization and\northography for Persian in digital environments is proposed. Finally, the\ncorpus and related statistic will be analyzed.", "published": "2014-04-17 16:22:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4572v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Multilingual Models for Compositional Distributed Semantics", "abstract": "We present a novel technique for learning semantic representations, which\nextends the distributional hypothesis to multilingual data and joint-space\nembeddings. Our models leverage parallel data and learn to strongly align the\nembeddings of semantically equivalent sentences, while maintaining sufficient\ndistance between those of dissimilar sentences. The models do not rely on word\nalignments or any syntactic information and are successfully applied to a\nnumber of diverse languages. We extend our approach to learn semantic\nrepresentations at the document level, too. We evaluate these models on two\ncross-lingual document classification tasks, outperforming the prior state of\nthe art. Through qualitative analysis and the study of pivoting effects we\ndemonstrate that our representations are semantically plausible and can capture\nsemantic relationships across languages without parallel data.", "published": "2014-04-17 20:18:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4641v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
