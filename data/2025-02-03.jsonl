{"title": "Supervised Similarity for High-Yield Corporate Bonds with Quantum Cognition Machine Learning", "abstract": "We investigate the application of quantum cognition machine learning (QCML),\na novel paradigm for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks rooted in\nthe mathematical formalism of quantum theory, to distance metric learning in\ncorporate bond markets. Compared to equities, corporate bonds are relatively\nilliquid and both trade and quote data in these securities are relatively\nsparse. Thus, a measure of distance/similarity among corporate bonds is\nparticularly useful for a variety of practical applications in the trading of\nilliquid bonds, including the identification of similar tradable alternatives,\npricing securities with relatively few recent quotes or trades, and explaining\nthe predictions and performance of ML models based on their training data.\nPrevious research has explored supervised similarity learning based on\nclassical tree-based models in this context; here, we explore the application\nof the QCML paradigm for supervised distance metric learning in the same\ncontext, showing that it outperforms classical tree-based models in high-yield\n(HY) markets, while giving comparable or better performance (depending on the\nevaluation metric) in investment grade (IG) markets.", "published": "2025-02-03 16:28:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01495v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Exploratory Utility Maximization Problem with Tsallis Entropy", "abstract": "We study expected utility maximization problem with constant relative risk\naversion utility function in a complete market under the reinforcement learning\nframework. To induce exploration, we introduce the Tsallis entropy regularizer,\nwhich generalizes the commonly used Shannon entropy. Unlike the classical\nMerton's problem, which is always well-posed and admits closed-form solutions,\nwe find that the utility maximization exploratory problem is ill-posed in\ncertain cases, due to over-exploration. With a carefully selected primary\ntemperature function, we investigate two specific examples, for which we fully\ncharacterize their well-posedness and provide semi-closed-form solutions. It is\ninteresting to find that one example has the well-known Gaussian distribution\nas the optimal strategy, while the other features the rare Wigner semicircle\ndistribution, which is equivalent to a scaled Beta distribution. The means of\nthe two optimal exploratory policies coincide with that of the classical\ncounterpart. In addition, we examine the convergence of the value function and\noptimal exploratory strategy as the exploration vanishes. Finally, we design a\nreinforcement learning algorithm and conduct numerical experiments to\ndemonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning.", "published": "2025-02-03 11:39:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01269v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
