{"title": "Proceedings of the 11th workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic", "abstract": "This volume contains the proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on\nQuantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2014), which was held from the 4th to the 6th of\nJune, 2014, at Kyoto University, Japan.\n  The goal of the QPL workshop series is to bring together researchers working\non mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and\nspatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use logical\ntools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,\nsemantic methods and other computer science methods for the study of physical\nbehavior in general. Over the past few years, there has been growing activity\nin these foundational approaches, together with a renewed interest in the\nfoundations of quantum theory, which complement the more mainstream research in\nquantum computation. Earlier workshops in this series, with the same acronym\nunder the name \"Quantum Programming Languages\", were held in Ottawa (2003),\nTurku (2004), Chicago (2005), and Oxford (2006). The first QPL under the new\nname Quantum Physics and Logic was held in Reykjavik (2008), followed by Oxford\n(2009 and 2010), Nijmegen (2011), Brussels (2012) and Barcelona (2013).", "published": "2014-12-28 03:54:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8102v1", "categories": ["cs.LO", "cs.CL", "cs.PL", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.LO"}
