{"title": "Transition-based Parsing with Context Enhancement and Future Reward\n  Reranking", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel reranking model, future reward reranking, to\nre-score the actions in a transition-based parser by using a global scorer.\nDifferent to conventional reranking parsing, the model searches for the best\ndependency tree in all feasible trees constraining by a sequence of actions to\nget the future reward of the sequence. The scorer is based on a first-order\ngraph-based parser with bidirectional LSTM, which catches different parsing\nview compared with the transition-based parser. Besides, since context\nenhancement has shown substantial improvement in the arc-stand transition-based\nparsing over the parsing accuracy, we implement context enhancement on an\narc-eager transition-base parser with stack LSTMs, the dynamic oracle and\ndropout supporting and achieve further improvement. With the global scorer and\ncontext enhancement, the results show that UAS of the parser increases as much\nas 1.20% for English and 1.66% for Chinese, and LAS increases as much as 1.32%\nfor English and 1.63% for Chinese. Moreover, we get state-of-the-art LASs,\nachieving 87.58% for Chinese and 93.37% for English.", "published": "2016-12-15 16:30:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05131v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Modeling Trolling in Social Media Conversations", "abstract": "Social media websites, electronic newspapers and Internet forums allow\nvisitors to leave comments for others to read and interact. This exchange is\nnot free from participants with malicious intentions, who troll others by\npositing messages that are intended to be provocative, offensive, or menacing.\nWith the goal of facilitating the computational modeling of trolling, we\npropose a trolling categorization that is novel in the sense that it allows\ncomment-based analysis from both the trolls' and the responders' perspectives,\ncharacterizing these two perspectives using four aspects, namely, the troll's\nintention and his intention disclosure, as well as the responder's\ninterpretation of the troll's intention and her response strategy. Using this\ncategorization, we annotate and release a dataset containing excerpts of Reddit\nconversations involving suspected trolls and their interactions with other\nusers. Finally, we identify the difficult-to-classify cases in our corpus and\nsuggest potential solutions for them.", "published": "2016-12-15 23:41:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05310v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning through Dialogue Interactions by Asking Questions", "abstract": "A good dialogue agent should have the ability to interact with users by both\nresponding to questions and by asking questions, and importantly to learn from\nboth types of interaction. In this work, we explore this direction by designing\na simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie domain that allow such\ninteractions between a learner and a teacher. We investigate how a learner can\nbenefit from asking questions in both offline and online reinforcement learning\nsettings, and demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions.\nFinally, real experiments with Mechanical Turk validate the approach. Our work\nrepresents a first step in developing such end-to-end learned interactive\ndialogue agents.", "published": "2016-12-15 05:46:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04936v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Recurrent Image Captioner: Describing Images with Spatial-Invariant\n  Transformation and Attention Filtering", "abstract": "Along with the prosperity of recurrent neural network in modelling sequential\ndata and the power of attention mechanism in automatically identify salient\ninformation, image captioning, a.k.a., image description, has been remarkably\nadvanced in recent years. Nonetheless, most existing paradigms may suffer from\nthe deficiency of invariance to images with different scaling, rotation, etc.;\nand effective integration of standalone attention to form a holistic end-to-end\nsystem. In this paper, we propose a novel image captioning architecture, termed\nRecurrent Image Captioner (\\textbf{RIC}), which allows visual encoder and\nlanguage decoder to coherently cooperate in a recurrent manner. Specifically,\nwe first equip CNN-based visual encoder with a differentiable layer to enable\nspatially invariant transformation of visual signals. Moreover, we deploy an\nattention filter module (differentiable) between encoder and decoder to\ndynamically determine salient visual parts. We also employ bidirectional LSTM\nto preprocess sentences for generating better textual representations. Besides,\nwe propose to exploit variational inference to optimize the whole architecture.\nExtensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets (i.e., Flickr8k,\nFlickr30k and MS COCO) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture\nas compared to most of the state-of-the-art methods.", "published": "2016-12-15 07:19:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04949v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

In\nthis work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of\ntypical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of\nstructured prediction.

{"title": "A Simple Approach to Multilingual Polarity Classification in Twitter", "abstract": "Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the\ninterest in mining opinions of social media users. Sentiment analysis consists\nin determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness\nor negativeness. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been\ntailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of\nlexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content. In\nthis contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use\nmultilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis\ncontests, and as starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems. We\ncompare our approach in eight different languages, three of them have important\ninternational contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and\nSENTIPOLC (Italian).
