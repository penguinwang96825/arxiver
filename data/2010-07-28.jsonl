{"title": "A Repeated Game Formulation of Energy-Efficient Decentralized Power Control", "abstract": "Decentralized multiple access channels where each transmitter wants to selfishly maximize his transmission energy-efficiency are considered. Transmitters are assumed to choose freely their power control policy and interact (through multiuser interference) several times. It is shown that the corresponding conflict of interest can have a predictable outcome, namely a finitely or discounted repeated game equilibrium. Remarkably, it is shown that this equilibrium is Pareto-efficient under reasonable sufficient conditions and the corresponding decentralized power control policies can be implemented under realistic information assumptions: only individual channel state information and a public signal are required to implement the equilibrium strategies. Explicit equilibrium conditions are derived in terms of minimum number of game stages or maximum discount factor. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to compare the performance of the proposed power control policies with those already existing and exploiting the same information assumptions namely, those derived for the one-shot and Stackelberg games.", "published": "2010-07-28 15:12:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.5004v1", "categories": ["math-ph", "cs.GT", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "math-ph"}
{"title": "Statistical mechanics approach to the probability distribution of money", "abstract": "This Chapter reviews statistical models for the probability distribution of money developed in the econophysics literature since the late 1990s. In these models, economic transactions are modeled as random transfers of money between the agents in payment for goods and services. Starting from the initially equal distribution of money, the system spontaneously develops a highly unequal distribution of money analogous to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in physics. Boundary conditions are crucial for achieving a stationary distribution. When debt is permitted, it destabilizes the system, unless some sort of limit is imposed on maximal debt.", "published": "2010-07-28 21:12:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.5074v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
