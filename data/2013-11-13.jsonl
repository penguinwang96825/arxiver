{"title": "Architecture of an Ontology-Based Domain-Specific Natural Language\n  Question Answering System", "abstract": "Question answering (QA) system aims at retrieving precise information from a\nlarge collection of documents against a query. This paper describes the\narchitecture of a Natural Language Question Answering (NLQA) system for a\nspecific domain based on the ontological information, a step towards semantic\nweb question answering. The proposed architecture defines four basic modules\nsuitable for enhancing current QA capabilities with the ability of processing\ncomplex questions. The first module was the question processing, which analyses\nand classifies the question and also reformulates the user query. The second\nmodule allows the process of retrieving the relevant documents. The next module\nprocesses the retrieved documents, and the last module performs the extraction\nand generation of a response. Natural language processing techniques are used\nfor processing the question and documents and also for answer extraction.\nOntology and domain knowledge are used for reformulating queries and\nidentifying the relations. The aim of the system is to generate short and\nspecific answer to the question that is asked in the natural language in a\nspecific domain. We have achieved 94 % accuracy of natural language question\nanswering in our implementation.", "published": "2013-11-13 15:36:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3175v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
