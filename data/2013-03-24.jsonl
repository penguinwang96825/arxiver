{"title": "SYNTAGMA. A Linguistic Approach to Parsing", "abstract": "SYNTAGMA is a rule-based parsing system, structured on two levels: a general\nparsing engine and a language specific grammar. The parsing engine is a\nlanguage independent program, while grammar and language specific rules and\nresources are given as text files, consisting in a list of constituent\nstructuresand a lexical database with word sense related features and\nconstraints. Since its theoretical background is principally Tesniere's\nElements de syntaxe, SYNTAGMA's grammar emphasizes the role of argument\nstructure (valency) in constraint satisfaction, and allows also horizontal\nbounds, for instance treating coordination. Notions such as Pro, traces, empty\ncategories are derived from Generative Grammar and some solutions are close to\nGovernment&Binding Theory, although they are the result of an autonomous\nresearch. These properties allow SYNTAGMA to manage complex syntactic\nconfigurations and well known weak points in parsing engineering. An important\nresource is the semantic network, which is used in disambiguation tasks.\nParsing process follows a bottom-up, rule driven strategy. Its behavior can be\ncontrolled and fine-tuned.", "published": "2013-03-24 15:27:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5960v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
