{"title": "Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing and the Syntacto-Discourse Treebank", "abstract": "Discourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent\nfrom constituency or dependency parsing. Most attempts at this problem are\npipelined rather than end-to-end, sophisticated, and not self-contained: they\nassume gold-standard text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units), and use\nexternal parsers for syntactic features. In this paper we propose the first\nend-to-end discourse parser that jointly parses in both syntax and discourse\nlevels, as well as the first syntacto-discourse treebank by integrating the\nPenn Treebank with the RST Treebank. Built upon our recent span-based\nconstituency parser, this joint syntacto-discourse parser requires no\npreprocessing whatsoever (such as segmentation or feature extraction), achieves\nthe state-of-the-art end-to-end discourse parsing accuracy.", "published": "2017-08-28 18:57:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08484v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "MIT-QCRI Arabic Dialect Identification System for the 2017 Multi-Genre\n  Broadcast Challenge", "abstract": "In order to successfully annotate the Arabic speech con- tent found in\nopen-domain media broadcasts, it is essential to be able to process a diverse\nset of Arabic dialects. For the 2017 Multi-Genre Broadcast challenge (MGB-3)\nthere were two possible tasks: Arabic speech recognition, and Arabic Dialect\nIdentification (ADI). In this paper, we describe our efforts to create an ADI\nsystem for the MGB-3 challenge, with the goal of distinguishing amongst four\nmajor Arabic dialects, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Our research fo-\ncused on dialect variability and domain mismatches between the training and\ntest domain. In order to achieve a robust ADI system, we explored both Siamese\nneural network models to learn similarity and dissimilarities among Arabic\ndialects, as well as i-vector post-processing to adapt domain mismatches. Both\nAcoustic and linguistic features were used for the final MGB-3 submissions,\nwith the best primary system achieving 75% accuracy on the official 10hr test\nset.", "published": "2017-08-28 14:20:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00387v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generating Query Suggestions to Support Task-Based Search", "abstract": "We address the problem of generating query suggestions to support users in\ncompleting their underlying tasks (which motivated them to search in the first\nplace). Given an initial query, these query suggestions should provide a\ncoverage of possible subtasks the user might be looking for. We propose a\nprobabilistic modeling framework that obtains keyphrases from multiple sources\nand generates query suggestions from these keyphrases. Using the test suites of\nthe TREC Tasks track, we evaluate and analyze each component of our model.", "published": "2017-08-28 12:44:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08289v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "On Type-Aware Entity Retrieval", "abstract": "Today, the practice of returning entities from a knowledge base in response\nto search queries has become widespread. One of the distinctive characteristics\nof entities is that they are typed, i.e., assigned to some hierarchically\norganized type system (type taxonomy). The primary objective of this paper is\nto gain a better understanding of how entity type information can be utilized\nin entity retrieval. We perform this investigation in an idealized \"oracle\"\nsetting, assuming that we know the distribution of target types of the relevant\nentities for a given query. We perform a thorough analysis of three main\naspects: (i) the choice of type taxonomy, (ii) the representation of\nhierarchical type information, and (iii) the combination of type-based and\nterm-based similarity in the retrieval model. Using a standard entity search\ntest collection based on DBpedia, we find that type information proves most\nuseful when using large type taxonomies that provide very specific types. We\nprovide further insights on the extensional coverage of entities and on the\nutility of target types.", "published": "2017-08-28 12:47:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08291v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
