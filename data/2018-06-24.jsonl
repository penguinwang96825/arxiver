{"title": "A Second Look at Post Crisis Pricing of Derivatives - Part I: A Note on Money Accounts and Collateral", "abstract": "The paper reviews origins of the approach to pricing derivatives post-crisis by following three papers that have received wide acceptance from practitioners as the theoretical foundations for it - [Piterbarg 2010], [Burgard and Kjaer 2010] and [Burgard and Kjaer 2013].\n  The review reveals several conceptual and technical inconsistencies with the approaches taken in these papers. In particular, a key component of the approach - prescription of cost components to a risk-free money account, generates derivative prices that are not cleared by the markets that trade the derivative and its underlying securities. It also introduces several risk-free positions (accounts) that accrue at persistently non-zero spreads with respect to each other and the risk free rate. In the case of derivatives with counterparty default risk [Burgard and Kjaer 2013] introduces an approach referred to as semi-replication, which through the choice of cost components in the money account results in derivative prices that carry arbitrage opportunities in the form of holding portfolio of counterparty's bonds versus a derivative position with it.\n  This paper derives no-arbitrage expressions for default-risky derivative contracts with and without collateral, avoiding these inconsistencies.", "published": "2018-06-24 19:48:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09198v4", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
{"title": "Optimal periodic replenishment policies for spectrally positive L\u00e9vy demand processes", "abstract": "We consider a version of the stochastic inventory control problem for a spectrally positive L\u00e9vy demand process, in which the inventory can only be replenished at independent exponential times. We show the optimality of a periodic barrier replenishment policy that restocks any shortage below a certain threshold at each replenishment opportunity. The optimal policies and value functions are concisely written in terms of the scale functions. Numerical results are also provided.", "published": "2018-06-24 21:40:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09216v2", "categories": ["math.OC", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
