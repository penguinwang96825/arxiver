{"title": "Toward verbalizing ontologies in isiZulu", "abstract": "IsiZulu is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa and roughly\nhalf the population can speak it. It is the first (home) language for over 10\nmillion people in South Africa. Only a few computational resources exist for\nisiZulu and its related Nguni languages, yet the imperative for tool\ndevelopment exists. We focus on natural language generation, and the grammar\noptions and preferences in particular, which will inform verbalization of\nknowledge representation languages and could contribute to machine translation.\nThe verbalization pattern specification shows that the grammar rules are\nelaborate and there are several options of which one may have preference. We\ndevised verbalization patterns for subsumption, basic disjointness, existential\nand universal quantification, and conjunction. This was evaluated in a survey\namong linguists and non-linguists. Some differences between linguists and\nnon-linguists can be observed, with the former much more in agreement, and\npreferences depend on the overall structure of the sentence, such as singular\nfor subsumption and plural in other cases.", "published": "2014-06-07 07:41:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1870v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.1"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
