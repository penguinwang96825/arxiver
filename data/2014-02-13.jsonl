{"title": "Event Structure of Transitive Verb: A MARVS perspective", "abstract": "Module-Attribute Representation of Verbal Semantics (MARVS) is a theory of\nthe representation of verbal semantics that is based on Mandarin Chinese data\n(Huang et al. 2000). In the MARVS theory, there are two different types of\nmodules: Event Structure Modules and Role Modules. There are also two sets of\nattributes: Event-Internal Attributes and Role-Internal Attributes, which are\nlinked to the Event Structure Module and the Role Module, respectively. In this\nstudy, we focus on four transitive verbs as chi1(eat), wan2(play),\nhuan4(change) and shao1(burn) and explore their event structures by the MARVS\ntheory.", "published": "2014-02-13 06:44:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3040v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Software Requirement Specification Using Reverse Speech Technology", "abstract": "Speech analysis had been taken to a new level with the discovery of Reverse\nSpeech (RS). RS is the discovery of hidden messages, referred as reversals, in\nnormal speech. Works are in progress for exploiting the relevance of RS in\ndifferent real world applications such as investigation, medical field etc. In\nthis paper we represent an innovative method for preparing a reliable Software\nRequirement Specification (SRS) document with the help of reverse speech. As\nSRS act as the backbone for the successful completion of any project, a\nreliable method is needed to overcome the inconsistencies. Using RS such a\nreliable method for SRS documentation was developed.", "published": "2014-02-13 10:28:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3080v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SD", "91F20(primary) 03B65, 68T50(secondary)"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
