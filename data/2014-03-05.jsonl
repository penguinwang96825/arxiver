{"title": "Latent Semantic Word Sense Disambiguation Using Global Co-occurrence\n  Information", "abstract": "In this paper, I propose a novel word sense disambiguation method based on\nthe global co-occurrence information using NMF. When I calculate the dependency\nrelation matrix, the existing method tends to produce very sparse co-occurrence\nmatrix from a small training set. Therefore, the NMF algorithm sometimes does\nnot converge to desired solutions. To obtain a large number of co-occurrence\nrelations, I propose to use co-occurrence frequencies of dependency relations\nbetween word features in the whole training set. This enables us to solve data\nsparseness problem and induce more effective latent features. To evaluate the\nefficiency of the method of word sense disambiguation, I make some experiments\nto compare with the result of the two baseline methods. The results of the\nexperiments show this method is effective for word sense disambiguation in\ncomparison with the all baseline methods. Moreover, the proposed method is\neffective for obtaining a stable effect by analyzing the global co-occurrence\ninformation.", "published": "2014-03-05 17:20:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1194v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
