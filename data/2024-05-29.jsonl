{"title": "HLOB -- Information Persistence and Structure in Limit Order Books", "abstract": "We introduce a novel large-scale deep learning model for Limit Order Book\nmid-price changes forecasting, and we name it `HLOB'. This architecture (i)\nexploits the information encoded by an Information Filtering Network, namely\nthe Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph, to unveil deeper and non-trivial\ndependency structures among volume levels; and (ii) guarantees deterministic\ndesign choices to handle the complexity of the underlying system by drawing\ninspiration from the groundbreaking class of Homological Convolutional Neural\nNetworks. We test our model against 9 state-of-the-art deep learning\nalternatives on 3 real-world Limit Order Book datasets, each including 15\nstocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange, and we systematically characterize the\nscenarios where HLOB outperforms state-of-the-art architectures. Our approach\nsheds new light on the spatial distribution of information in Limit Order Books\nand on its degradation over increasing prediction horizons, narrowing the gap\nbetween microstructural modeling and deep learning-based forecasting in\nhigh-frequency financial markets.", "published": "2024-05-29 09:46:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18938v3", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Optimizing Broker Performance Evaluation through Intraday Modeling of Execution Cost", "abstract": "Minimizing execution costs for large orders is a fundamental challenge in\nfinance. Firms often depend on brokers to manage their trades due to limited\ninternal resources for optimizing trading strategies. This paper presents a\nmethodology for evaluating the effectiveness of broker execution algorithms\nusing trading data. We focus on two primary cost components: a linear cost that\nquantifies short-term execution quality and a quadratic cost associated with\nthe price impact of trades. Using a model with transient price impact, we\nderive analytical formulas for estimating these costs. Furthermore, we enhance\nestimation accuracy by introducing novel methods such as weighting price\nchanges based on their expected impact content. Our results demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements in estimating both linear and impact costs, providing\na robust and efficient framework for selecting the most cost-effective brokers.", "published": "2024-05-29 09:41:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18936v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
