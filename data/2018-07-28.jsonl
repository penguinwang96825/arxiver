{"title": "Resilience of airborne networks", "abstract": "Networked flying platforms can be used to provide cellular coverage and capacity. Given that 5G and beyond networks are expected to be always available and highly reliable, resilience and reliability of these networks must be investigated. This paper introduces the specific features of airborne networks that influence their resilience. We then discuss how machine learning and blockchain technologies can enhance the resilience of networked flying platforms.", "published": "2018-07-28 17:47:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10962v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
