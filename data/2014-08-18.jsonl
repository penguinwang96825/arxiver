{"title": "On Detecting Messaging Abuse in Short Text Messages using Linguistic and\n  Behavioral patterns", "abstract": "The use of short text messages in social media and instant messaging has\nbecome a popular communication channel during the last years. This rising\npopularity has caused an increment in messaging threats such as spam, phishing\nor malware as well as other threats. The processing of these short text message\nthreats could pose additional challenges such as the presence of lexical\nvariants, SMS-like contractions or advanced obfuscations which can degrade the\nperformance of traditional filtering solutions. By using a real-world SMS data\nset from a large telecommunications operator from the US and a social media\ncorpus, in this paper we analyze the effectiveness of machine learning filters\nbased on linguistic and behavioral patterns in order to detect short text spam\nand abusive users in the network. We have also explored different ways to deal\nwith short text message challenges such as tokenization and entity detection by\nusing text normalization and substring clustering techniques. The obtained\nresults show the validity of the proposed solution by enhancing baseline\napproaches.", "published": "2014-08-18 08:47:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3934v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
