{"title": "Evolution of the Modern Phase of Written Bangla: A Statistical Study", "abstract": "Active languages such as Bangla (or Bengali) evolve over time due to a\nvariety of social, cultural, economic, and political issues. In this paper, we\nanalyze the change in the written form of the modern phase of Bangla\nquantitatively in terms of character-level, syllable-level, morpheme-level and\nword-level features. We collect three different types of corpora---classical,\nnewspapers and blogs---and test whether the differences in their features are\nstatistically significant. Results suggest that there are significant changes\nin the length of a word when measured in terms of characters, but there is not\nmuch difference in usage of different characters, syllables and morphemes in a\nword or of different words in a sentence. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work on Bangla of this kind.", "published": "2013-10-06 14:37:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1590v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

Past approaches project labels\nacross bitext and use them as features or gold labels for training. We propose\na new method that projects model expectations rather than labels, which\nfacilities transfer of model uncertainty across language boundaries. We encode\nexpectations as constraints and train a discriminative CRF model using\nGeneralized Expectation Criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010). Evaluated on\nstandard Chinese-English and German-English NER datasets, our method\ndemonstrates F1 scores of 64% and 60% when no labeled data is used. Attaining\nthe same accuracy with supervised CRFs requires 12k and 1.5k labeled sentences.\nFurthermore, when combined with labeled examples, our method yields significant\nimprovements over state-of-the-art supervised methods, achieving best reported\nnumbers to date on Chinese OntoNotes and German CoNLL-03 datasets.", "published": "2013-10-06 16:34:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1597v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
