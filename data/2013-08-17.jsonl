{"title": "Implementation Of Back-Propagation Neural Network For Isolated Bangla\n  Speech Recognition", "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the development of Back-propagation Neural\nNetwork for Bangla Speech Recognition. In this paper, ten bangla digits were\nrecorded from ten speakers and have been recognized. The features of these\nspeech digits were extracted by the method of Mel Frequency Cepstral\nCoefficient (MFCC) analysis. The mfcc features of five speakers were used to\ntrain the network with Back propagation algorithm. The mfcc features of ten\nbangla digit speeches, from 0 to 9, of another five speakers were used to test\nthe system. All the methods and algorithms used in this research were\nimplemented using the features of Turbo C and C++ languages. From our\ninvestigation it is seen that the developed system can successfully encode and\nanalyze the mfcc features of the speech signal to recognition. The developed\nsystem achieved recognition rate about 96.332% for known speakers (i.e.,\nspeaker dependent) and 92% for unknown speakers (i.e., speaker independent).", "published": "2013-08-17 14:04:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3785v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
