{"title": "Online Bayesian Goal Inference for Boundedly-Rational Planning Agents", "abstract": "People routinely infer the goals of others by observing their actions over time. Remarkably, we can do so even when those actions lead to failure, enabling us to assist others when we detect that they might not achieve their goals. How might we endow machines with similar capabilities? Here we present an architecture capable of inferring an agent's goals online from both optimal and non-optimal sequences of actions. Our architecture models agents as boundedly-rational planners that interleave search with execution by replanning, thereby accounting for sub-optimal behavior. These models are specified as probabilistic programs, allowing us to represent and perform efficient Bayesian inference over an agent's goals and internal planning processes. To perform such inference, we develop Sequential Inverse Plan Search (SIPS), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that exploits the online replanning assumption of these models, limiting computation by incrementally extending inferred plans as new actions are observed. We present experiments showing that this modeling and inference architecture outperforms Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning baselines, accurately inferring goals from both optimal and non-optimal trajectories involving failure and back-tracking, while generalizing across domains with compositional structure and sparse rewards.", "published": "2020-06-13 01:48:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07532v2", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "DeeperGCN: All You Need to Train Deeper GCNs", "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been drawing significant attention with the power of representation learning on graphs. Unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are able to take advantage of stacking very deep layers, GCNs suffer from vanishing gradient, over-smoothing and over-fitting issues when going deeper. These challenges limit the representation power of GCNs on large-scale graphs. This paper proposes DeeperGCN that is capable of successfully and reliably training very deep GCNs. We define differentiable generalized aggregation functions to unify different message aggregation operations (e.g. mean, max). We also propose a novel normalization layer namely MsgNorm and a pre-activation version of residual connections for GCNs. Extensive experiments on Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) show DeeperGCN significantly boosts performance over the state-of-the-art on the large scale graph learning tasks of node property prediction and graph property prediction.

{"title": "Backward Deep BSDE Methods and Applications to Nonlinear Problems", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a backward deep BSDE method applied to Forward Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDE) with given terminal condition at maturity that time-steps the BSDE backwards. We present an application of this method to a nonlinear pricing problem - the differential rates problem. To time-step the BSDE backward, one needs to solve a nonlinear problem. For the differential rates problem, we derive an exact solution of this time-step problem and a Taylor-based approximation. Previously backward deep BSDE methods only treated zero or linear generators. While a Taylor approach for nonlinear generators was previously mentioned, it had not been implemented or applied, while we apply our method to nonlinear generators and derive details and present results. Likewise, previously backward deep BSDE methods were presented for fixed initial risk factor values $X_0$ only, while we present a version with random $X_0$ and a version that learns portfolio values at intermediate times as well. The method is able to solve nonlinear FBSDE problems in high dimensions.", "published": "2020-06-13 13:01:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07635v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Mean Field Exponential Utility Game: A Probabilistic Approach", "abstract": "We study an $N$-player and a mean field exponential utility game. Each player manages two stocks; one is driven by an individual shock and the other is driven by a common shock. Moreover, each player is concerned not only with her own terminal wealth but also with the relative performance of her competitors. We use the probabilistic approach to study these two games. We show the unique equilibrium of the $N$-player game and the mean field game can be characterized by a novel multi-dimensional FBSDE with quadratic growth and a novel mean-field FBSDEs, respectively. The well-posedness result and the convergence result are established.", "published": "2020-06-13 17:15:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07684v2", "categories": ["math.OC", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
