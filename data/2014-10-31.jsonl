{"title": "Experiments to Improve Named Entity Recognition on Turkish Tweets", "abstract": "Social media texts are significant information sources for several\napplication areas including trend analysis, event monitoring, and opinion\nmining. Unfortunately, existing solutions for tasks such as named entity\nrecognition that perform well on formal texts usually perform poorly when\napplied to social media texts. In this paper, we report on experiments that\nhave the purpose of improving named entity recognition on Turkish tweets, using\ntwo different annotated data sets. In these experiments, starting with a\nbaseline named entity recognition system, we adapt its recognition rules and\nresources to better fit Twitter language by relaxing its capitalization\nconstraint and by diacritics-based expansion of its lexical resources, and we\nemploy a simplistic normalization scheme on tweets to observe the effects of\nthese on the overall named entity recognition performance on Turkish tweets.\nThe evaluation results of the system with these different settings are provided\nwith discussions of these results.", "published": "2014-10-31 08:35:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8668v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Supervised learning model for parsing Arabic language", "abstract": "Parsing the Arabic language is a difficult task given the specificities of\nthis language and given the scarcity of digital resources (grammars and\nannotated corpora). In this paper, we suggest a method for Arabic parsing based\non supervised machine learning. We used the SVMs algorithm to select the\nsyntactic labels of the sentence. Furthermore, we evaluated our parser\nfollowing the cross validation method by using the Penn Arabic Treebank. The\nobtained results are very encouraging.", "published": "2014-10-31 15:53:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8783v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Rapid Adaptation of POS Tagging for Domain Specific Uses", "abstract": "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental component for performing\nnatural language tasks such as parsing, information extraction, and question\nanswering. When POS taggers are trained in one domain and applied in\nsignificantly different domains, their performance can degrade dramatically. We\npresent a methodology for rapid adaptation of POS taggers to new domains. Our\ntechnique is unsupervised in that a manually annotated corpus for the new\ndomain is not necessary. We use suffix information gathered from large amounts\nof raw text as well as orthographic information to increase the lexical\ncoverage. We present an experiment in the Biological domain where our POS\ntagger achieves results comparable to POS taggers specifically trained to this\ndomain.", "published": "2014-10-31 20:04:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0007v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
