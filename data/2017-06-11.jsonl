{"title": "Exploring Automated Essay Scoring for Nonnative English Speakers", "abstract": "Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has been quite popular and is being widely\nused. However, lack of appropriate methodology for rating nonnative English\nspeakers' essays has meant a lopsided advancement in this field. In this paper,\nwe report initial results of our experiments with nonnative AES that learns\nfrom manual evaluation of nonnative essays. For this purpose, we conducted an\nexercise in which essays written by nonnative English speakers in test\nenvironment were rated both manually and by the automated system designed for\nthe experiment. In the process, we experimented with a few features to learn\nabout nuances linked to nonnative evaluation. The proposed methodology of\nautomated essay evaluation has yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.750 with\nthe manual evaluation.", "published": "2017-06-11 10:18:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03335v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Full Non-Monotonic Transition System for Unrestricted Non-Projective\n  Parsing", "abstract": "Restricted non-monotonicity has been shown beneficial for the projective\narc-eager dependency parser in previous research, as posterior decisions can\nrepair mistakes made in previous states due to the lack of information. In this\npaper, we propose a novel, fully non-monotonic transition system based on the\nnon-projective Covington algorithm. As a non-monotonic system requires\nexploration of erroneous actions during the training process, we develop\nseveral non-monotonic variants of the recently defined dynamic oracle for the\nCovington parser, based on tight approximations of the loss. Experiments on\ndatasets from the CoNLL-X and CoNLL-XI shared tasks show that a non-monotonic\ndynamic oracle outperforms the monotonic version in the majority of languages.", "published": "2017-06-11 16:04:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03367v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Generic Axiomatization of Families of Noncrossing Graphs in Dependency\n  Parsing", "abstract": "We present a simple encoding for unlabeled noncrossing graphs and show how\nits latent counterpart helps us to represent several families of directed and\nundirected graphs used in syntactic and semantic parsing of natural language as\ncontext-free languages. The families are separated purely on the basis of\nforbidden patterns in latent encoding, eliminating the need to differentiate\nthe families of non-crossing graphs in inference algorithms: one algorithm\nworks for all when the search space can be controlled in parser input.", "published": "2017-06-11 14:37:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03357v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.FL", "68T50, 68Q45", "F.4.3; I.2.7; F.4.2"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
