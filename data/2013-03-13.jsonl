{"title": "Types and forgetfulness in categorical linguistics and quantum mechanics", "abstract": "The role of types in categorical models of meaning is investigated. A general\nscheme for how typed models of meaning may be used to compare sentences,\nregardless of their grammatical structure is described, and a toy example is\nused as an illustration. Taking as a starting point the question of whether the\nevaluation of such a type system 'loses information', we consider the\nparametrized typing associated with connectives from this viewpoint.\n  The answer to this question implies that, within full categorical models of\nmeaning, the objects associated with types must exhibit a simple but subtle\ncategorical property known as self-similarity. We investigate the category\ntheory behind this, with explicit reference to typed systems, and their\nmonoidal closed structure. We then demonstrate close connections between such\nself-similar structures and dagger Frobenius algebras. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the categorical structures implied by the polymorphically\ntyped connectives give rise to a (lax unitless) form of the special forms of\nFrobenius algebras known as classical structures, used heavily in abstract\ncategorical approaches to quantum mechanics.", "published": "2013-03-13 14:32:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3170v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.CT", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
