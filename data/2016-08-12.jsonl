{"title": "Redefining part-of-speech classes with distributional semantic models", "abstract": "This paper studies how word embeddings trained on the British National Corpus\ninteract with part of speech boundaries. Our work targets the Universal PoS tag\nset, which is currently actively being used for annotation of a range of\nlanguages. We experiment with training classifiers for predicting PoS tags for\nwords based on their embeddings. The results show that the information about\nPoS affiliation contained in the distributional vectors allows us to discover\ngroups of words with distributional patterns that differ from other words of\nthe same part of speech.\n  This data often reveals hidden inconsistencies of the annotation process or\nguidelines. At the same time, it supports the notion of `soft' or `graded' part\nof speech affiliations. Finally, we show that information about PoS is\ndistributed among dozens of vector components, not limited to only one or two\nfeatures.", "published": "2016-08-12 14:15:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03803v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

We propose graph analysis methods for quantifying the gap\nbetween human curated pathway maps and the output of state-of-the-art automatic\nNLP systems. Evaluation is performed on the popular mTOR pathway.

{"title": "Compositional Distributional Cognition", "abstract": "We accommodate the Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Architecture (ICS) of\n[32] within the categorical compositional semantics (CatCo) of [13], forming a\nmodel of categorical compositional cognition (CatCog). This resolves intrinsic\nproblems with ICS such as the fact that representations inhabit an unbounded\nspace and that sentences with differing tree structures cannot be directly\ncompared. We do so in a way that makes the most of the grammatical structure\navailable, in contrast to strategies like circular convolution. Using the CatCo\nmodel also allows us to make use of tools developed for CatCo such as the\nrepresentation of ambiguity and logical reasoning via density matrices,\nstructural meanings for words such as relative pronouns, and addressing over-\nand under-extension, all of which are present in cognitive processes. Moreover\nthe CatCog framework is sufficiently flexible to allow for entirely different\nrepresentations of meaning, such as conceptual spaces. Interestingly, since the\nCatCo model was largely inspired by categorical quantum mechanics, so is\nCatCog.", "published": "2016-08-12 13:13:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03785v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "math.CT"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Rapid Classification of Crisis-Related Data on Social Networks using\n  Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "The role of social media, in particular microblogging platforms such as\nTwitter, as a conduit for actionable and tactical information during disasters\nis increasingly acknowledged. However, time-critical analysis of big crisis\ndata on social media streams brings challenges to machine learning techniques,\nespecially the ones that use supervised learning. The Scarcity of labeled data,\nparticularly in the early hours of a crisis, delays the machine learning\nprocess. The current state-of-the-art classification methods require a\nsignificant amount of labeled data specific to a particular event for training\nplus a lot of feature engineering to achieve best results. In this work, we\nintroduce neural network based classification methods for binary and\nmulti-class tweet classification task. We show that neural network based models\ndo not require any feature engineering and perform better than state-of-the-art\nmethods. In the early hours of a disaster when no labeled data is available,\nour proposed method makes the best use of the out-of-event data and achieves\ngood results.", "published": "2016-08-12 20:19:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03902v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
