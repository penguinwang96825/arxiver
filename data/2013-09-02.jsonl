{"title": "Smooth solutions to portfolio liquidation problems under price-sensitive market impact", "abstract": "We consider the stochastic control problem of a financial trader that needs to unwind a large asset portfolio within a short period of time. The trader can simultaneously submit active orders to a primary market and passive orders to a dark pool. Our framework is flexible enough to allow for price-dependent impact functions describing the trading costs in the primary market and price-dependent adverse selection costs associated with dark pool trading. We prove that the value function can be characterized in terms of the unique smooth solution to a PDE with singular terminal value, establish its explicit asymptotic behavior at the terminal time, and give the optimal trading strategy in feedback form.", "published": "2013-09-02 17:43:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0474v7", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "math.OC", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
