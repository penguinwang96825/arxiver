Comparison on the ArXiv Dataset", "abstract": "In this work, we compare two simple methods of tagging scientific\npublications with labels reflecting their content. As a first source of labels\nWikipedia is employed, second label set is constructed from the noun phrases\noccurring in the analyzed corpus. We examine the statistical properties and the\neffectiveness of both approaches on the dataset consisting of abstracts from\n0.7 million of scientific documents deposited in the ArXiv preprint collection.\nWe believe that obtained tags can be later on applied as useful document\nfeatures in various machine learning tasks (document similarity, clustering,\ntopic modelling, etc.).", "published": "2013-09-02 09:09:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0326v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
