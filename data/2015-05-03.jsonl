{"title": "VQA: Visual Question Answering", "abstract": "We propose the task of free-form and open-ended Visual Question Answering\n(VQA). Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task\nis to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world\nscenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and\nanswers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of\nan image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a\nsystem that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of\nthe image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions.\nMoreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended\nanswers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be\nprovided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing ~0.25M\nimages, ~0.76M questions, and ~10M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the\ninformation it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided\nand compared with human performance. Our VQA demo is available on CloudCV\n(http://cloudcv.org/vqa).", "published": "2015-05-03 20:07:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00468v7", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
