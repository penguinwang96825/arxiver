{"title": "Political Leanings in Web3 Betting: Decoding the Interplay of Political and Profitable Motives", "abstract": "Harnessing the transparent blockchain user behavior data, we construct the\nPolitical Betting Leaning Score (PBLS) to measure political leanings based on\nbetting within Web3 prediction markets. Focusing on Polymarket and starting\nfrom the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we synthesize behaviors over 15,000\naddresses across 4,500 events and 8,500 markets, capturing the intensity and\ndirection of their political leanings by the PBLS. We validate the PBLS through\ninternal consistency checks and external comparisons. We uncover relationships\nbetween our PBLS and betting behaviors through over 800 features capturing\nvarious behavioral aspects. A case study of the 2022 U.S. Senate election\nfurther demonstrates the ability of our measurement while decoding the dynamic\ninteraction between political and profitable motives. Our findings contribute\nto understanding decision-making in decentralized markets, enhancing the\nanalysis of behaviors within Web3 prediction environments. The insights of this\nstudy reveal the potential of blockchain in enabling innovative,\nmultidisciplinary studies and could inform the development of more effective\nonline prediction markets, improve the accuracy of forecast, and help the\ndesign and optimization of platform mechanisms.
