{"title": "On Detecting Noun-Adjective Agreement Errors in Bulgarian Language Using\n  GATE", "abstract": "In this article, we describe an approach for automatic detection of\nnoun-adjective agreement errors in Bulgarian texts by explaining the necessary\nsteps required to develop a simple Java-based language processing application.\nFor this purpose, we use the GATE language processing framework, which is\ncapable of analyzing texts in Bulgarian language and can be embedded in\nsoftware applications, accessed through a set of Java APIs. In our example\napplication we also demonstrate how to use the functionality of GATE to perform\nregular expressions over annotations for detecting agreement errors in simple\nnoun phrases formed by two words - attributive adjective and a noun, where the\nattributive adjective precedes the noun. The provided code samples can also be\nused as a starting point for implementing natural language processing\nfunctionalities in software applications related to language processing tasks\nlike detection, annotation and retrieval of word groups meeting a specific set\nof criteria.", "published": "2014-11-03 18:05:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0588v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
