{"title": "ManTIME: Temporal expression identification and normalization in the\n  TempEval-3 challenge", "abstract": "This paper describes a temporal expression identification and normalization\nsystem, ManTIME, developed for the TempEval-3 challenge. The identification\nphase combines the use of conditional random fields along with a\npost-processing identification pipeline, whereas the normalization phase is\ncarried out using NorMA, an open-source rule-based temporal normalizer. We\ninvestigate the performance variation with respect to different feature types.\nSpecifically, we show that the use of WordNet-based features in the\nidentification task negatively affects the overall performance, and that there\nis no statistically significant difference in using gazetteers, shallow parsing\nand propositional noun phrases labels on top of the morphological features. On\nthe test data, the best run achieved 0.95 (P), 0.85 (R) and 0.90 (F1) in the\nidentification phase. Normalization accuracies are 0.84 (type attribute) and\n0.77 (value attribute). Surprisingly, the use of the silver data (alone or in\naddition to the gold annotated ones) does not improve the performance.", "published": "2013-04-30 10:12:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7942v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2.7; I.2.4; I.2.6"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
