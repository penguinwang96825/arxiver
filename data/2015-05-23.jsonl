{"title": "Exposing ambiguities in a relation-extraction gold standard with\n  crowdsourcing", "abstract": "Semantic relation extraction is one of the frontiers of biomedical natural\nlanguage processing research. Gold standards are key tools for advancing this\nresearch. It is challenging to generate these standards because of the high\ncost of expert time and the difficulty in establishing agreement between\nannotators. We implemented and evaluated a microtask crowdsourcing approach\nthat can produce a gold standard for extracting drug-disease relations. The\naggregated crowd judgment agreed with expert annotations from a pre-existing\ncorpus on 43 of 60 sentences tested. The levels of crowd agreement varied in a\nsimilar manner to the levels of agreement among the original expert annotators.\nThis work rein-forces the power of crowdsourcing in the process of assembling\ngold standards for relation extraction. Further, it high-lights the importance\nof exposing the levels of agreement between human annotators, expert or crowd,\nin gold standard corpora as these are reproducible signals indicating\nambiguities in the data or in the annotation guidelines.", "published": "2015-05-23 00:32:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06256v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "q-bio.QM"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Text to 3D Scene Generation with Rich Lexical Grounding", "abstract": "The ability to map descriptions of scenes to 3D geometric representations has\nmany applications in areas such as art, education, and robotics. However, prior\nwork on the text to 3D scene generation task has used manually specified object\ncategories and language that identifies them. We introduce a dataset of 3D\nscenes annotated with natural language descriptions and learn from this data\nhow to ground textual descriptions to physical objects. Our method successfully\ngrounds a variety of lexical terms to concrete referents, and we show\nquantitatively that our method improves 3D scene generation over previous work\nusing purely rule-based methods. We evaluate the fidelity and plausibility of\n3D scenes generated with our grounding approach through human judgments. To\nease evaluation on this task, we also introduce an automated metric that\nstrongly correlates with human judgments.", "published": "2015-05-23 08:32:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06289v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.GR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Frobenius Model of Information Structure in Categorical Compositional\n  Distributional Semantics", "abstract": "The categorical compositional distributional model of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and\nClark provides a linguistically motivated procedure for computing the meaning\nof a sentence as a function of the distributional meaning of the words therein.\nThe theoretical framework allows for reasoning about compositional aspects of\nlanguage and offers structural ways of studying the underlying relationships.\nWhile the model so far has been applied on the level of syntactic structures, a\nsentence can bring extra information conveyed in utterances via intonational\nmeans. In the current paper we extend the framework in order to accommodate\nthis additional information, using Frobenius algebraic structures canonically\ninduced over the basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces. We detail the\ntheory, provide truth-theoretic and distributional semantics for meanings of\nintonationally-marked utterances, and present justifications and extensive\nexamples.", "published": "2015-05-23 09:08:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06294v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "math.CT", "math.RA"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
