{"title": "Information Flow in the FTX Bankruptcy: A Network Approach", "abstract": "This paper investigates the cryptocurrency network of the FTX exchange during\nthe collapse of its native token, FTT, to understand how network structures\nadapt to significant financial disruptions, by exploiting vertex centrality\nmeasures. Using proprietary data on the transactional relationships between\nvarious cryptocurrencies, we construct the filtered correlation matrix to\nidentify the most significant relations in the FTX and Binance markets. By\nusing suitable centrality measures - closeness and information centrality - we\nassess network stability during FTX's bankruptcy. The findings document the\nappropriateness of such vertex centralities in understanding the resilience and\nvulnerabilities of financial networks. By tracking the changes in centrality\nvalues before and during the FTX crisis, this study provides useful insights\ninto the structural dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Results reveal how\ndifferent cryptocurrencies experienced shifts in their network roles due to the\ncrisis. Moreover, our findings highlight the interconnectedness of\ncryptocurrency markets and how the failure of a single entity can lead to\nwidespread repercussions that destabilize other nodes of the network.", "published": "2024-07-17 16:02:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12683v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
