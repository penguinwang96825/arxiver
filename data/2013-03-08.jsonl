{"title": "Towards the Fully Automatic Merging of Lexical Resources: A Step Forward", "abstract": "This article reports on the results of the research done towards the fully\nautomatically merging of lexical resources. Our main goal is to show the\ngenerality of the proposed approach, which have been previously applied to\nmerge Spanish Subcategorization Frames lexica. In this work we extend and apply\nthe same technique to perform the merging of morphosyntactic lexica encoded in\nLMF. The experiments showed that the technique is general enough to obtain good\nresults in these two different tasks which is an important step towards\nperforming the merging of lexical resources fully automatically.", "published": "2013-03-08 10:13:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1929v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Automatic lexical semantic classification of nouns", "abstract": "The work we present here addresses cue-based noun classification in English\nand Spanish. Its main objective is to automatically acquire lexical semantic\ninformation by classifying nouns into previously known noun lexical classes.\nThis is achieved by using particular aspects of linguistic contexts as cues\nthat identify a specific lexical class. Here we concentrate on the task of\nidentifying such cues and the theoretical background that allows for an\nassessment of the complexity of the task. The results show that, despite of the\na-priori complexity of the task, cue-based classification is a useful tool in\nthe automatic acquisition of lexical semantic classes.", "published": "2013-03-08 10:14:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1930v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Classification of Adjectives for Polarity Lexicons Enhancement", "abstract": "Subjective language detection is one of the most important challenges in\nSentiment Analysis. Because of the weight and frequency in opinionated texts,\nadjectives are considered a key piece in the opinion extraction process. These\nsubjective units are more and more frequently collected in polarity lexicons in\nwhich they appear annotated with their prior polarity. However, at the moment,\nany polarity lexicon takes into account prior polarity variations across\ndomains. This paper proves that a majority of adjectives change their prior\npolarity value depending on the domain. We propose a distinction between domain\ndependent and domain independent adjectives. Moreover, our analysis led us to\npropose a further classification related to subjectivity degree: constant,\nmixed and highly subjective adjectives. Following this classification, polarity\nvalues will be a better support for Sentiment Analysis.", "published": "2013-03-08 10:14:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1931v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Mining and Exploiting Domain-Specific Corpora in the PANACEA Platform", "abstract": "The objective of the PANACEA ICT-2007.2.2 EU project is to build a platform\nthat automates the stages involved in the acquisition, production, updating and\nmaintenance of the large language resources required by, among others, MT\nsystems. The development of a Corpus Acquisition Component (CAC) for extracting\nmonolingual and bilingual data from the web is one of the most innovative\nbuilding blocks of PANACEA. The CAC, which is the first stage in the PANACEA\npipeline for building Language Resources, adopts an efficient and distributed\nmethodology to crawl for web documents with rich textual content in specific\nlanguages and predefined domains. The CAC includes modules that can acquire\nparallel data from sites with in-domain content available in more than one\nlanguage. In order to extrinsically evaluate the CAC methodology, we have\nconducted several experiments that used crawled parallel corpora for the\nidentification and extraction of parallel sentences using sentence alignment.\nThe corpora were then successfully used for domain adaptation of Machine\nTranslation Systems.", "published": "2013-03-08 10:15:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1932v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
