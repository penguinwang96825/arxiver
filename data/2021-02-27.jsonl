{"title": "Pricing Exchange Rate Options and Quanto Caps in the Cross-Currency Random Field LIBOR Market Model", "abstract": "We develop an arbitrage-free random field LIBOR market model to price cross-currency derivatives. The uncertainty of the forward LIBOR rates of our cross-currency model is driven by a two time parameter random field instead of a finite dimensional Brownian motion. To demonstrate the applications of this model, we develop an approximate closed-form pricing formula for Quanto caps and cross-currency swaps. Further, we derive an exact pricing formula for an exchange rate option in the random field setting.", "published": "2021-02-27 21:09:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00323v2", "categories": ["q-fin.PR", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PR"}
