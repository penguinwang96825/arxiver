{"title": "On Using Monolingual Corpora in Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Recent work on end-to-end neural network-based architectures for machine\ntranslation has shown promising results for En-Fr and En-De translation.\nArguably, one of the major factors behind this success has been the\navailability of high quality parallel corpora. In this work, we investigate how\nto leverage abundant monolingual corpora for neural machine translation.\nCompared to a phrase-based and hierarchical baseline, we obtain up to $1.96$\nBLEU improvement on the low-resource language pair Turkish-English, and $1.59$\nBLEU on the focused domain task of Chinese-English chat messages. While our\nmethod was initially targeted toward such tasks with less parallel data, we\nshow that it also extends to high resource languages such as Cs-En and De-En\nwhere we obtain an improvement of $0.39$ and $0.47$ BLEU scores over the neural\nmachine translation baselines, respectively.", "published": "2015-03-11 23:50:04", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03535v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Matching Natural Language\n  Sentences", "abstract": "Semantic matching is of central importance to many natural language tasks\n\\cite{bordes2014semantic,RetrievalQA}. A successful matching algorithm needs to\nadequately model the internal structures of language objects and the\ninteraction between them. As a step toward this goal, we propose convolutional\nneural network models for matching two sentences, by adapting the convolutional\nstrategy in vision and speech. The proposed models not only nicely represent\nthe hierarchical structures of sentences with their layer-by-layer composition\nand pooling, but also capture the rich matching patterns at different levels.\nOur models are rather generic, requiring no prior knowledge on language, and\ncan hence be applied to matching tasks of different nature and in different\nlanguages. The empirical study on a variety of matching tasks demonstrates the\nefficacy of the proposed model on a variety of matching tasks and its\nsuperiority to competitor models.", "published": "2015-03-11 09:46:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03244v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Is language evolution grinding to a halt? The scaling of lexical\n  turbulence in English fiction suggests it is not", "abstract": "Of basic interest is the quantification of the long term growth of a\nlanguage's lexicon as it develops to more completely cover both a culture's\ncommunication requirements and knowledge space. Here, we explore the usage\ndynamics of words in the English language as reflected by the Google Books 2012\nEnglish Fiction corpus. We critique an earlier method that found decreasing\nbirth and increasing death rates of words over the second half of the 20th\nCentury, showing death rates to be strongly affected by the imposed time cutoff\nof the arbitrary present and not increasing dramatically. We provide a robust,\nprincipled approach to examining lexical evolution by tracking the volume of\nword flux across various relative frequency thresholds. We show that while the\noverall statistical structure of the English language remains stable over time\nin terms of its raw Zipf distribution, we find evidence of an enduring `lexical\nturbulence': The flux of words across frequency thresholds from decade to\ndecade scales superlinearly with word rank and exhibits a scaling break we\nconnect to that of Zipf's law. To better understand the changing lexicon, we\nexamine the contributions to the Jensen-Shannon divergence of individual words\ncrossing frequency thresholds. We also find indications that scholarly works\nabout fiction are strongly represented in the 2012 English Fiction corpus, and\nsuggest that a future revision of the corpus should attempt to separate\ncritical works from fiction itself.", "published": "2015-03-11 21:32:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03512v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IT", "math.IT", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
