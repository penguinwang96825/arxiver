{"title": "There's No Comparison: Reference-less Evaluation Metrics in Grammatical\n  Error Correction", "abstract": "Current methods for automatically evaluating grammatical error correction\n(GEC) systems rely on gold-standard references. However, these methods suffer\nfrom penalizing grammatical edits that are correct but not in the gold\nstandard. We show that reference-less grammaticality metrics correlate very\nstrongly with human judgments and are competitive with the leading\nreference-based evaluation metrics. By interpolating both methods, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. Finally, we show that GEC\nmetrics are much more reliable when they are calculated at the sentence level\ninstead of the corpus level. We have set up a CodaLab site for benchmarking GEC\noutput using a common dataset and different evaluation metrics.", "published": "2016-10-07 02:17:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02124v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Challenges of Computational Processing of Code-Switching", "abstract": "This paper addresses challenges of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on\nnon-canonical multilingual data in which two or more languages are mixed. It\nrefers to code-switching which has become more popular in our daily life and\ntherefore obtains an increasing amount of attention from the research\ncommunity. We report our experience that cov- ers not only core NLP tasks such\nas normalisation, language identification, language modelling, part-of-speech\ntagging and dependency parsing but also more downstream ones such as machine\ntranslation and automatic speech recognition. We highlight and discuss the key\nproblems for each of the tasks with supporting examples from different language\npairs and relevant previous work.", "published": "2016-10-07 10:22:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02213v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Morphology Generation for Statistical Machine Translation using Deep\n  Learning Techniques", "abstract": "Morphology in unbalanced languages remains a big challenge in the context of\nmachine translation. In this paper, we propose to de-couple machine translation\nfrom morphology generation in order to better deal with the problem. We\ninvestigate the morphology simplification with a reasonable trade-off between\nexpected gain and generation complexity. For the Chinese-Spanish task, optimum\nmorphological simplification is in gender and number. For this purpose, we\ndesign a new classification architecture which, compared to other standard\nmachine learning techniques, obtains the best results. This proposed\nneural-based architecture consists of several layers: an embedding, a\nconvolutional followed by a recurrent neural network and, finally, ends with\nsigmoid and softmax layers. We obtain classification results over 98% accuracy\nin gender classification, over 93% in number classification, and an overall\ntranslation improvement of 0.7 METEOR.", "published": "2016-10-07 09:59:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02209v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Diverse Beam Search: Decoding Diverse Solutions from Neural Sequence\n  Models", "abstract": "Neural sequence models are widely used to model time-series data. Equally\nubiquitous is the usage of beam search (BS) as an approximate inference\nalgorithm to decode output sequences from these models. BS explores the search\nspace in a greedy left-right fashion retaining only the top-B candidates -\nresulting in sequences that differ only slightly from each other. Producing\nlists of nearly identical sequences is not only computationally wasteful but\nalso typically fails to capture the inherent ambiguity of complex AI tasks. To\novercome this problem, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), an alternative to\nBS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing for a\ndiversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method finds better top-1\nsolutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search\nspace - implying that DBS is a better search algorithm. Moreover, these gains\nare achieved with minimal computational or memory over- head as compared to\nbeam search. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we present\nresults on image captioning, machine translation and visual question generation\nusing both standard quantitative metrics and qualitative human studies.\nFurther, we study the role of diversity for image-grounded language generation\ntasks as the complexity of the image changes. We observe that our method\nconsistently outperforms BS and previously proposed techniques for diverse\ndecoding from neural sequence models.", "published": "2016-10-07 20:56:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02424v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
