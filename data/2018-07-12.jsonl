{"title": "Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Text Classification", "abstract": "In text classification, the problem of overfitting arises due to the high dimensionality, making regularization essential. Although classic regularizers provide sparsity, they fail to return highly accurate models. On the contrary, state-of-the-art group-lasso regularizers provide better results at the expense of low sparsity. In this paper, we apply a greedy variable selection algorithm, called Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, for the text classification task. We also extend standard group OMP by introducing overlapping Group OMP to handle overlapping groups of features. Empirical analysis verifies that both OMP and overlapping GOMP constitute powerful regularizers, able to produce effective and very sparse models.

{"title": "Monte Carlo Methods for the Game Kingdomino", "abstract": "Kingdomino is introduced as an interesting game for studying game playing: the game is multiplayer (4 independent players per game); it has a limited game depth (13 moves per player); and it has limited but not insignificant interaction among players.\n  Several strategies based on locally greedy players, Monte Carlo Evaluation (MCE), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are presented with variants. We examine a variation of UCT called progressive win bias and a playout policy (Player-greedy) focused on selecting good moves for the player. A thorough evaluation is done showing how the strategies perform and how to choose parameters given specific time constraints. The evaluation shows that surprisingly MCE is stronger than MCTS for a game like Kingdomino.\n  All experiments use a cloud-native design, with a game server in a Docker container, and agents communicating using a REST-style JSON protocol. This enables a multi-language approach to separating the game state, the strategy implementations, and the coordination layer.", "published": "2018-07-12 08:07:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04458v2", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "LandmarkBoost: Efficient Visual Context Classifiers for Robust Localization", "abstract": "The growing popularity of autonomous systems creates a need for reliable and efficient metric pose retrieval algorithms. Currently used approaches tend to rely on nearest neighbor search of binary descriptors to perform the 2D-3D matching and guarantee realtime capabilities on mobile platforms. These methods struggle, however, with the growing size of the map, changes in viewpoint or appearance, and visual aliasing present in the environment. The rigidly defined descriptor patterns only capture a limited neighborhood of the keypoint and completely ignore the overall visual context.\n  We propose LandmarkBoost - an approach that, in contrast to the conventional 2D-3D matching methods, casts the search problem as a landmark classification task. We use a boosted classifier to classify landmark observations and directly obtain correspondences as classifier scores. We also introduce a formulation of visual context that is flexible, efficient to compute, and can capture relationships in the entire image plane. The original binary descriptors are augmented with contextual information and informative features are selected by the boosting framework. Through detailed experiments, we evaluate the retrieval quality and performance of LandmarkBoost, demonstrating that it outperforms common state-of-the-art descriptor matching methods.", "published": "2018-07-12 16:14:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04702v2", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
{"title": "Will it Blend? Composing Value Functions in Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "An important property for lifelong-learning agents is the ability to combine existing skills to solve unseen tasks. In general, however, it is unclear how to compose skills in a principled way. We provide a \"recipe\" for optimal value function composition in entropy-regularised reinforcement learning (RL) and then extend this to the standard RL setting. Composition is demonstrated in a video game environment, where an agent with an existing library of policies is able to solve new tasks without the need for further learning.", "published": "2018-07-12 06:43:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04439v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Scalable Convolutional Dictionary Learning with Constrained Recurrent Sparse Auto-encoders", "abstract": "Given a convolutional dictionary underlying a set of observed signals, can a carefully designed auto-encoder recover the dictionary in the presence of noise? We introduce an auto-encoder architecture, termed constrained recurrent sparse auto-encoder (CRsAE), that answers this question in the affirmative. Given an input signal and an approximate dictionary, the encoder finds a sparse approximation using FISTA. The decoder reconstructs the signal by applying the dictionary to the output of the encoder. The encoder and decoder in CRsAE parallel the sparse-coding and dictionary update steps in optimization-based alternating-minimization schemes for dictionary learning. As such, the parameters of the encoder and decoder are not independent, a constraint which we enforce for the first time. We derive the back-propagation algorithm for CRsAE. CRsAE is a framework for blind source separation that, only knowing the number of sources (dictionary elements), and assuming sparsely-many can overlap, is able to separate them. We demonstrate its utility in the context of spike sorting, a source separation problem in computational neuroscience. We demonstrate the ability of CRsAE to recover the underlying dictionary and characterize its sensitivity as a function of SNR.", "published": "2018-07-12 17:18:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04734v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
