{"title": "Multi-Error-Correcting Amplitude Damping Codes", "abstract": "We construct new families of multi-error-correcting quantum codes for the amplitude damping channel. Our key observation is that, with proper encoding, two uses of the amplitude damping channel simulate a quantum erasure channel. This allows us to use concatenated codes with quantum erasure-correcting codes as outer codes for correcting multiple amplitude damping errors. Our new codes are degenerate stabilizer codes and have parameters which are better than the amplitude damping codes obtained by any previously known construction.", "published": "2010-01-14 03:01:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2356v1", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "quant-ph"}
{"title": "PPM demodulation: On approaching fundamental limits of optical communications", "abstract": "We consider the problem of demodulating M-ary optical PPM (pulse-position modulation) waveforms, and propose a structured receiver whose mean probability of symbol error is smaller than all known receivers, and approaches the quantum limit. The receiver uses photodetection coupled with optimized phase-coherent optical feedback control and a phase-sensitive parametric amplifier. We present a general framework of optical receivers known as the conditional pulse nulling receiver, and present new results on ultimate limits and achievable regions of spectral versus photon efficiency tradeoffs for the single-spatial-mode pure-loss optical communication channel.", "published": "2010-01-14 12:58:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2447v2", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "quant-ph"}
