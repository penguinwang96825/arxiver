{"title": "BiHRNN -- Bi-Directional Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network for Inflation Forecasting", "abstract": "Inflation prediction guides decisions on interest rates, investments, and\nwages, playing a key role in economic stability. Yet accurate forecasting is\nchallenging due to dynamic factors and the layered structure of the Consumer\nPrice Index, which organizes goods and services into multiple categories. We\npropose the Bi-directional Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (BiHRNN) model\nto address these challenges by leveraging the hierarchical structure to enable\nbidirectional information flow between levels. Informative constraints on the\nRNN parameters enhance predictive accuracy at all levels without the\ninefficiencies of a unified model. We validated BiHRNN on inflation datasets\nfrom the United States, Canada, and Norway by training, tuning hyperparameters,\nand experimenting with various loss functions. Our results demonstrate that\nBiHRNN significantly outperforms traditional RNN models, with its bidirectional\narchitecture playing a pivotal role in achieving improved forecasting accuracy.", "published": "2025-02-27 16:12:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01893v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "econ.GN", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Optimal risk-aware interest rates for decentralized lending protocols", "abstract": "Decentralized lending protocols within the decentralized finance ecosystem\nenable the lending and borrowing of crypto-assets without relying on\ntraditional intermediaries. Interest rates in these protocols are set\nalgorithmically and fluctuate according to the supply and demand for liquidity.\nIn this study, we propose an agent-based model tailored to a decentralized\nlending protocol and determine the optimal interest rate model. When the\nresponses of the agents are linear with respect to the interest rate, the\noptimal solution is derived from a system of Riccati-type ODEs. For nonlinear\nbehaviors, we propose a Monte-Carlo estimator, coupled with deep learning\ntechniques, to approximate the optimal solution. Finally, after calibrating the\nmodel using block-by-block data, we conduct a risk-adjusted profit and loss\nanalysis of the liquidity pool under industry-standard interest rate models and\nbenchmark them against the optimal interest rate model.", "published": "2025-02-27 08:05:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19862v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Detecting Crypto Pump-and-Dump Schemes: A Thresholding-Based Approach to Handling Market Noise", "abstract": "We propose a simple yet robust unsupervised model to detect pump-and-dump\nevents on tokens listed on the Poloniex Exchange platform. By combining\nthreshold-based criteria with exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) and\nvolatility measures, our approach effectively distinguishes genuine anomalies\nfrom minor trading fluctuations, even for tokens with low liquidity and\nprolonged inactivity. These characteristics present a unique challenge, as\nstandard anomaly-detection methods often over-flag negligible volume spikes.\nOur framework overcomes this issue by tailoring both price and volume\nthresholds to the specific trading patterns observed, resulting in a model that\nbalances high true-positive detection with minimal noise.", "published": "2025-02-27 09:50:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08692v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Better market Maker Algorithm to Save Impermanent Loss with High Liquidity Retention", "abstract": "Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) face persistent challenges in liquidity\nretention and user engagement due to inefficiencies in conventional automated\nmarket maker (AMM) designs. This work proposes a dual-mechanism framework to\naddress these limitations: a ``Better Market Maker (BMM)'', which is a\nliquidity-optimized AMM based on a power-law invariant ($X^nY = K$, $n = 4$),\nand a dynamic rebate system (DRS) for redistributing transaction fees. The\nsegment-specific BMM reduces impermanent loss by 36\\% compared to traditional\nconstant-product ($XY = K$) models, while retaining 3.98x more liquidity during\nprice volatility. The DRS allocates fees ($\\gamma V$, $\\gamma \\in \\{0.003,\n0.005, 0.01\\}$) with a rebate ratio $\\rho \\in [0.3, 0.4]$ to incentivize trader\nparticipation and maintain continuous capital injection. Simulations under\nhigh-volatility conditions demonstrate impermanent loss reductions of 36.0\\%\nand 40\\% higher user engagement compared to static fee models. By segmenting\nmarkets into high-, mid-, and low-volatility regimes, the framework achieves\nliquidity depth comparable to centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining\ndecentralized governance and retaining value within the cryptocurrency\necosystem.", "published": "2025-02-27 11:28:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20001v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
