{"title": "Room-Across-Room: Multilingual Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dense Spatiotemporal Grounding", "abstract": "We introduce Room-Across-Room (RxR), a new Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) dataset. RxR is multilingual (English, Hindi, and Telugu) and larger (more paths and instructions) than other VLN datasets. It emphasizes the role of language in VLN by addressing known biases in paths and eliciting more references to visible entities. Furthermore, each word in an instruction is time-aligned to the virtual poses of instruction creators and validators. We establish baseline scores for monolingual and multilingual settings and multitask learning when including Room-to-Room annotations. We also provide results for a model that learns from synchronized pose traces by focusing only on portions of the panorama attended to in human demonstrations. The size, scope and detail of RxR dramatically expands the frontier for research on embodied language agents in simulated, photo-realistic environments.", "published": "2020-10-15 18:01:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07954v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Magnetic Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo", "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms offer various strategies for sampling; the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) family of samplers are MCMC algorithms which often exhibit improved mixing properties. The recently introduced magnetic HMC, a generalization of HMC motivated by the physics of particles influenced by magnetic field forces, has been demonstrated to improve the performance of HMC. In many applications, one wishes to sample from a distribution restricted to a constrained set, often manifested as an embedded manifold (for example, the surface of a sphere). We introduce magnetic manifold HMC, an HMC algorithm on embedded manifolds motivated by the physics of particles constrained to a manifold and moving under magnetic field forces. We discuss the theoretical properties of magnetic Hamiltonian dynamics on manifolds, and introduce a reversible and symplectic integrator for the HMC updates. We demonstrate that magnetic manifold HMC produces favorable sampling behaviors relative to the canonical variant of manifold-constrained HMC.", "published": "2020-10-15 13:53:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07753v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
