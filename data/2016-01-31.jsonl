{"title": "WASSUP? LOL : Characterizing Out-of-Vocabulary Words in Twitter", "abstract": "Language in social media is mostly driven by new words and spellings that are\nconstantly entering the lexicon thereby polluting it and resulting in high\ndeviation from the formal written version. The primary entities of such\nlanguage are the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper, we study various\nsociolinguistic properties of the OOV words and propose a classification model\nto categorize them into at least six categories. We achieve 81.26% accuracy\nwith high precision and recall. We observe that the content features are the\nmost discriminative ones followed by lexical and context features.", "published": "2016-01-31 18:12:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00293v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
