{"title": "Clustering Algorithm for Gujarati Language", "abstract": "Natural language processing area is still under research. But now a day it is\non platform for worldwide researchers. Natural language processing includes\nanalyzing the language based on its structure and then tagging of each word\nappropriately with its grammar base. Here we have 50,000 tagged words set and\nwe try to cluster those Gujarati words based on proposed algorithm, we have\ndefined our own algorithm for processing. Many clustering techniques are\navailable Ex. Single linkage, complete, linkage,average linkage, Hear no of\nclusters to be formed are not known, so it is all depends on the type of data\nset provided . Clustering is preprocess for stemming . Stemming is the process\nwhere root is extracted from its word. Ex. cats= cat+S, meaning. Cat: Noun and\nplural form.", "published": "2013-07-20 09:05:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5393v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
