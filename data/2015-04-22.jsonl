{"title": "A Hierarchical Distance-dependent Bayesian Model for Event Coreference\n  Resolution", "abstract": "We present a novel hierarchical distance-dependent Bayesian model for event\ncoreference resolution. While existing generative models for event coreference\nresolution are completely unsupervised, our model allows for the incorporation\nof pairwise distances between event mentions -- information that is widely used\nin supervised coreference models to guide the generative clustering processing\nfor better event clustering both within and across documents. We model the\ndistances between event mentions using a feature-rich learnable distance\nfunction and encode them as Bayesian priors for nonparametric clustering.\nExperiments on the ECB+ corpus show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods for both within- and cross-document event coreference resolution.", "published": "2015-04-22 19:13:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05929v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
