{"title": "Targetable Named Entity Recognition in Social Media", "abstract": "We present a novel approach for recognizing what we call targetable named\nentities; that is, named entities in a targeted set (e.g, movies, books, TV\nshows). Unlike many other NER systems that need to retrain their statistical\nmodels as new entities arrive, our approach does not require such retraining,\nwhich makes it more adaptable for types of entities that are frequently\nupdated. For this preliminary study, we focus on one entity type, movie title,\nusing data collected from Twitter. Our system is tested on two evaluation sets,\none including only entities corresponding to movies in our training set, and\nthe other excluding any of those entities. Our final model shows F1-scores of\n76.19% and 78.70% on these evaluation sets, which gives strong evidence that\nour approach is completely unbiased to any par- ticular set of entities found\nduring training.", "published": "2014-08-04 19:31:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0782v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
