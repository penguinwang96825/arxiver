{"title": "Automated Market Makers: Toward More Profitable Liquidity Provisioning Strategies", "abstract": "To trade tokens in cryptoeconomic systems, automated market makers (AMMs)\ntypically rely on liquidity providers (LPs) that deposit tokens in exchange for\nrewards. To profit from such rewards, LPs must use effective liquidity\nprovisioning strategies. However, LPs lack guidance for developing such\nstrategies, which often leads them to financial losses. We developed a\nmeasurement model based on impermanent loss to analyze the influences of key\nparameters (i.e., liquidity pool type, position duration, position range size,\nand position size) of liquidity provisioning strategies on LPs' returns. To\nreveal the influences of those key parameters on LPs' profits, we used the\nmeasurement model to analyze 700 days of historical liquidity provision data of\nUniswap v3. By uncovering the influences of key parameters of liquidity\nprovisioning strategies on profitability, this work supports LPs in developing\nmore profitable strategies.", "published": "2025-01-14 04:12:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07828v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
