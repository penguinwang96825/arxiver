{"title": "Probably approximately correct quantum source coding", "abstract": "Information-theoretic lower bounds are often encountered in several branches of computer science, including learning theory and cryptography. In the quantum setting, Holevo's and Nayak's bounds give an estimate of the amount of classical information that can be stored in a quantum state. Previous works have shown how to combine information-theoretic tools with a counting argument to lower bound the sample complexity of distribution-free quantum probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. In our work, we establish the notion of Probably Approximately Correct Source Coding and we show two novel applications in quantum learning theory and delegated quantum computation with a purely classical client. In particular, we provide a lower bound of the sample complexity of a quantum learner for arbitrary functions under the Zipf distribution, and we improve the security guarantees of a classically-driven delegation protocol for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC).", "published": "2021-12-13 17:57:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06841v1", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cs.CR", "cs.IT", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "quant-ph"}
{"title": "Optimal Expansion of Business Opportunity", "abstract": "Any firm whose business strategy has an exposure constraint that limits its potential gain naturally considers expansion, as this can increase its exposure. We model business expansion as an enlargement of the opportunity set for business policies. However, expansion is irreversible and has an opportunity cost attached. We use the expected optimization of utility to formulate this as a novel stochastic control problem combined with an optimal stopping time, and we derive an explicit solution for exponential utility. We apply the framework to an investment and a reinsurance scenario. In the investment problem, the cost and incentives to increase the trading exposure are analyzed, while the optimal timing for an insurer to launch its reinsurance business is investigated in the reinsurance problem. Our model predicts that the additional income gained through business expansion is the key incentive for a decision to expand. Interestingly, companies may have this incentive but are likely to wait for a period of time before expanding, although situations of zero opportunity cost or specific restrictive conditions on the model parameters are exceptions to waiting. The business policy remains on the boundary of the opportunity set before expansion during the waiting period. The length of the waiting period is related to the opportunity cost, return, and risk of the expanded business.", "published": "2021-12-13 14:46:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06706v1", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "COVID-19 Forecasts via Stock Market Indicators", "abstract": "Reliable short term forecasting can provide potentially lifesaving insights into logistical planning, and in particular, into the optimal allocation of resources such as hospital staff and equipment. By reinterpreting COVID-19 daily cases in terms of candlesticks, we are able to apply some of the most popular stock market technical indicators to obtain predictive power over the course of the pandemics. By providing a quantitative assessment of MACD, RSI, and candlestick analyses, we show their statistical significance in making predictions for both stock market data and WHO COVID-19 data. In particular, we show the utility of this novel approach by considering the identification of the beginnings of subsequent waves of the pandemic. Finally, our new methods are used to assess whether current health policies are impacting the growth in new COVID-19 cases.", "published": "2021-12-13 03:05:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06393v1", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "physics.soc-ph", "q-fin.TR", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "q-bio.PE"}
