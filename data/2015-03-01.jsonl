{"title": "Variation of word frequencies in Russian literary texts", "abstract": "We study the variation of word frequencies in Russian literary texts. Our\nfindings indicate that the standard deviation of a word's frequency across\ntexts depends on its average frequency according to a power law with exponent\n$0.62,$ showing that the rarer words have a relatively larger degree of\nfrequency volatility (i.e., \"burstiness\").\n  Several latent factors models have been estimated to investigate the\nstructure of the word frequency distribution. The dependence of a word's\nfrequency volatility on its average frequency can be explained by the asymmetry\nin the distribution of latent factors.", "published": "2015-03-01 19:37:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00339v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.soc-ph", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
