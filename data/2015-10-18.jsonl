{"title": "Neural Reranking Improves Subjective Quality of Machine Translation:\n  NAIST at WAT2015", "abstract": "This year, the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)'s submission\nto the 2015 Workshop on Asian Translation was based on syntax-based statistical\nmachine translation, with the addition of a reranking component using neural\nattentional machine translation models. Experiments re-confirmed results from\nprevious work stating that neural MT reranking provides a large gain in\nobjective evaluation measures such as BLEU, and also confirmed for the first\ntime that these results also carry over to manual evaluation. We further\nperform a detailed analysis of reasons for this increase, finding that the main\ncontributions of the neural models lie in improvement of the grammatical\ncorrectness of the output, as opposed to improvements in lexical choice of\ncontent words.", "published": "2015-10-18 06:26:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05203v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Learning multi-faceted representations of individuals from heterogeneous\n  evidence using neural networks", "abstract": "Inferring latent attributes of people online is an important social computing\ntask, but requires integrating the many heterogeneous sources of information\navailable on the web. We propose learning individual representations of people\nusing neural nets to integrate rich linguistic and network evidence gathered\nfrom social media. The algorithm is able to combine diverse cues, such as the\ntext a person writes, their attributes (e.g. gender, employer, education,\nlocation) and social relations to other people. We show that by integrating\nboth textual and network evidence, these representations offer improved\nperformance at four important tasks in social media inference on Twitter:\npredicting (1) gender, (2) occupation, (3) location, and (4) friendships for\nusers. Our approach scales to large datasets and the learned representations\ncan be used as general features in and have the potential to benefit a large\nnumber of downstream tasks including link prediction, community detection, or\nprobabilistic reasoning over social networks.", "published": "2015-10-18 04:26:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05198v4", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
