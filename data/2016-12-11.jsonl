{"title": "Flu Detector: Estimating influenza-like illness rates from online\n  user-generated content", "abstract": "We provide a brief technical description of an online platform for disease\nmonitoring, titled as the Flu Detector (fludetector.cs.ucl.ac.uk). Flu\nDetector, in its current version (v.0.5), uses either Twitter or Google search\ndata in conjunction with statistical Natural Language Processing models to\nestimate the rate of influenza-like illness in the population of England. Its\nback-end is a live service that collects online data, utilises modern\ntechnologies for large-scale text processing, and finally applies statistical\ninference models that are trained offline. The front-end visualises the various\ndisease rate estimates. Notably, the models based on Google data achieve a high\nlevel of accuracy with respect to the most recent four flu seasons in England\n(2012/13 to 2015/16). This highlighted Flu Detector as having a great potential\nof becoming a complementary source to the domestic traditional flu surveillance\nschemes.", "published": "2016-12-11 22:27:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03494v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
