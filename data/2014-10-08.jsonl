{"title": "Contrastive Unsupervised Word Alignment with Non-Local Features", "abstract": "Word alignment is an important natural language processing task that\nindicates the correspondence between natural languages. Recently, unsupervised\nlearning of log-linear models for word alignment has received considerable\nattention as it combines the merits of generative and discriminative\napproaches. However, a major challenge still remains: it is intractable to\ncalculate the expectations of non-local features that are critical for\ncapturing the divergence between natural languages. We propose a contrastive\napproach that aims to differentiate observed training examples from noises. It\nnot only introduces prior knowledge to guide unsupervised learning but also\ncancels out partition functions. Based on the observation that the probability\nmass of log-linear models for word alignment is usually highly concentrated, we\npropose to use top-n alignments to approximate the expectations with respect to\nposterior distributions. This allows for efficient and accurate calculation of\nexpectations of non-local features. Experiments show that our approach achieves\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised word alignment\nmethods.", "published": "2014-10-08 12:24:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2082v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Supervised learning Methods for Bangla Web Document Categorization", "abstract": "This paper explores the use of machine learning approaches, or more\nspecifically, four supervised learning Methods, namely Decision Tree(C 4.5),\nK-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Na\\\"ive Bays (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nfor categorization of Bangla web documents. This is a task of automatically\nsorting a set of documents into categories from a predefined set. Whereas a\nwide range of methods have been applied to English text categorization,\nrelatively few studies have been conducted on Bangla language text\ncategorization. Hence, we attempt to analyze the efficiency of those four\nmethods for categorization of Bangla documents. In order to validate, Bangla\ncorpus from various websites has been developed and used as examples for the\nexperiment. For Bangla, empirical results support that all four methods produce\nsatisfactory performance with SVM attaining good result in terms of high\ndimensional and relatively noisy document feature vectors.", "published": "2014-10-08 10:01:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2045v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Scalable, Lexicon Based Technique for Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "Rapid increase in the volume of sentiment rich social media on the web has\nresulted in an increased interest among researchers regarding Sentimental\nAnalysis and opinion mining. However, with so much social media available on\nthe web, sentiment analysis is now considered as a big data task. Hence the\nconventional sentiment analysis approaches fails to efficiently handle the vast\namount of sentiment data available now a days. The main focus of the research\nwas to find such a technique that can efficiently perform sentiment analysis on\nbig data sets. A technique that can categorize the text as positive, negative\nand neutral in a fast and accurate manner. In the research, sentiment analysis\nwas performed on a large data set of tweets using Hadoop and the performance of\nthe technique was measured in form of speed and accuracy. The experimental\nresults shows that the technique exhibits very good efficiency in handling big\nsentiment data sets.", "published": "2014-10-08 20:29:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2265v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
