{"title": "A Stock Price Prediction Approach Based on Time Series Decomposition and Multi-Scale CNN using OHLCT Images", "abstract": "Recently, deep learning in stock prediction has become an important branch.\nImage-based methods show potential by capturing complex visual patterns and\nspatial correlations, offering advantages in interpretability over time series\nmodels. However, image-based approaches are more prone to overfitting,\nhindering robust predictive performance. To improve accuracy, this paper\nproposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multi-scale Fusion Regression\nConvolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements\nin the China A-share market.\n  By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image\nfeatures, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share\nmarket stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image\nfeatures, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive\ncomparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the model achieves a\n61.15% positive predictive value and a 63.37% negative predictive value for the\nnext 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.", "published": "2024-10-25 03:50:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19291v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
