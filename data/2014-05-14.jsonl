{"title": "Temporal Analysis of Language through Neural Language Models", "abstract": "We provide a method for automatically detecting change in language across\ntime through a chronologically trained neural language model. We train the\nmodel on the Google Books Ngram corpus to obtain word vector representations\nspecific to each year, and identify words that have changed significantly from\n1900 to 2009. The model identifies words such as \"cell\" and \"gay\" as having\nchanged during that time period. The model simultaneously identifies the\nspecific years during which such words underwent change.", "published": "2014-05-14 14:47:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3515v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Pattern Recognition in Narrative: Tracking Emotional Expression in\n  Context", "abstract": "Using geometric data analysis, our objective is the analysis of narrative,\nwith narrative of emotion being the focus in this work. The following two\nprinciples for analysis of emotion inform our work. Firstly, emotion is\nrevealed not as a quality in its own right but rather through interaction. We\nstudy the 2-way relationship of Ilsa and Rick in the movie Casablanca, and the\n3-way relationship of Emma, Charles and Rodolphe in the novel {\\em Madame\nBovary}. Secondly, emotion, that is expression of states of mind of subjects,\nis formed and evolves within the narrative that expresses external events and\n(personal, social, physical) context. In addition to the analysis methodology\nwith key aspects that are innovative, the input data used is crucial. We use,\nfirstly, dialogue, and secondly, broad and general description that\nincorporates dialogue. In a follow-on study, we apply our unsupervised\nnarrative mapping to data streams with very low emotional expression. We map\nthe narrative of Twitter streams. Thus we demonstrate map analysis of general\nnarratives.", "published": "2014-05-14 15:29:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3539v3", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "62H25, 62H30, 62.07", "H.2.8; H.3; I.5; I.7.0; J.5"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
