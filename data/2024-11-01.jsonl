{"title": "Simulate and Optimise: A two-layer mortgage simulator for designing novel mortgage assistance products", "abstract": "We develop a novel two-layer approach for optimising mortgage relief products\nthrough a simulated multi-agent mortgage environment. While the approach is\ngeneric, here the environment is calibrated to the US mortgage market based on\npublicly available census data and regulatory guidelines. Through the\nsimulation layer, we assess the resilience of households to exogenous income\nshocks, while the optimisation layer explores strategies to improve the\nrobustness of households to these shocks by making novel mortgage assistance\nproducts available to households. Households in the simulation are adaptive,\nlearning to make mortgage-related decisions (such as product enrolment or\nstrategic foreclosures) that maximize their utility, balancing their available\nliquidity and equity. We show how this novel two-layer simulation approach can\nsuccessfully design novel mortgage assistance products to improve household\nresilience to exogenous shocks, and balance the costs of providing such\nproducts through post-hoc analysis. Previously, such analysis could only be\nconducted through expensive pilot studies involving real participants,\ndemonstrating the benefit of the approach for designing and evaluating\nfinancial products.", "published": "2024-11-01 13:21:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00563v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.AI", "cs.CE", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Evaluating Company-specific Biases in Financial Sentiment Analysis using Large Language Models", "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the sentiment of financial texts using large\nlanguage models~(LLMs) and to empirically determine whether LLMs exhibit\ncompany-specific biases in sentiment analysis. Specifically, we examine the\nimpact of general knowledge about firms on the sentiment measurement of texts\nby LLMs. Firstly, we compare the sentiment scores of financial texts by LLMs\nwhen the company name is explicitly included in the prompt versus when it is\nnot. We define and quantify company-specific bias as the difference between\nthese scores. Next, we construct an economic model to theoretically evaluate\nthe impact of sentiment bias on investor behavior. This model helps us\nunderstand how biased LLM investments, when widespread, can distort stock\nprices. This implies the potential impact on stock prices if investments driven\nby biased LLMs become dominant in the future. Finally, we conduct an empirical\nanalysis using Japanese financial text data to examine the relationship between\nfirm-specific sentiment bias, corporate characteristics, and stock performance.", "published": "2024-11-01 07:37:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00420v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

{"title": "Discrete approximation of risk-based prices under volatility uncertainty", "abstract": "We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of risk-based indifference prices of\nEuropean contingent claims in discrete-time financial markets under volatility\nuncertainty as the number of intermediate trading periods tends to infinity.\nThe asymptotic risk-based prices form a strongly continuous convex monotone\nsemigroup which is uniquely determined by its infinitesimal generator and\ntherefore only depends on the covariance of the random factors but not on the\nparticular choice of the model. We further compare the risk-based prices with\nthe worst-case prices given by the $G$-expectation and investigate their\nasymptotic behaviour as the risk aversion of the agent tends to infinity. The\ntheoretical results are illustrated with several examples and numerical\nsimulations showing, in particular, that the risk-based prices lead to a\nsignificant reduction of the bid-ask spread compared to the worst-case prices.", "published": "2024-11-01 16:27:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00713v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Graph Neural Networks for Financial Fraud Detection: A Review", "abstract": "The landscape of financial transactions has grown increasingly complex due to\nthe expansion of global economic integration and advancements in information\ntechnology. This complexity poses greater challenges in detecting and managing\nfinancial fraud. This review explores the role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nin addressing these challenges by proposing a unified framework that\ncategorizes existing GNN methodologies applied to financial fraud detection.\nSpecifically, by examining a series of detailed research questions, this review\ndelves into the suitability of GNNs for financial fraud detection, their\ndeployment in real-world scenarios, and the design considerations that enhance\ntheir effectiveness. This review reveals that GNNs are exceptionally adept at\ncapturing complex relational patterns and dynamics within financial networks,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional fraud detection methods. Unlike\nprevious surveys that often overlook the specific potentials of GNNs or address\nthem only superficially, our review provides a comprehensive, structured\nanalysis, distinctly focusing on the multifaceted applications and deployments\nof GNNs in financial fraud detection. This review not only highlights the\npotential of GNNs to improve fraud detection mechanisms but also identifies\ncurrent gaps and outlines future research directions to enhance their\ndeployment in financial systems. Through a structured review of over 100\nstudies, this review paper contributes to the understanding of GNN applications\nin financial fraud detection, offering insights into their adaptability and\npotential integration strategies.", "published": "2024-11-01 03:59:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05815v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
