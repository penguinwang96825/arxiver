While\nthe LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still\nface this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are\nless effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.\nFurthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks\nrelationships of weight values within rows or columns.

Existing approaches\npredominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical\ninsights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information\nwithin structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce\nand assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing\ntechniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource\nutilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR\ndatasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with\nleading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key\ncomponents in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained\nsentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the\ncorruption in structured EHRs.

In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models\nthrough the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward\nconditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an\ninference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining\nthe outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average.

Because these solvers sit on the\ncritical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas\nare key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed\nwell on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly\nevolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show\npromise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:\nnearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative\ninteractions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In\nthis study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that\naddresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the\nsynthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,\nChimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for\nSMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)\nsynthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.\nDuring fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing\nformulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.\nThis design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.\nNotably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,\ndramatically reducing runtime cost.

By simulating diverse brain alterations\nfrom healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without\nrequiring pathological annotations.\n  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with\nCCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on\nCCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with\nother pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically\nrelevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show\ntheir utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes.

In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight\nbounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a\nfactor-$1/(1-\\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap\nProperty (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these\ntechniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large\nindependent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an\nonline greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are\nconjectured to fail even in the \"easy\" regime where greedy succeeds. We show\nthat the largest $\\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite\ngraphs has size $\\alpha:=\\frac{\\log_b n}{\\gamma(1-\\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is\nthe size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$.

While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance.

Attribution patching offers a\nfaster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced\nreliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce\nRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution\npatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only\ntwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency\nwhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for\nMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by\nRelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits\nidentified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves\ncomparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with\nIG.", "published": "2025-08-28 23:09:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21258v1", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning", "abstract": "Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) is an important multimedia task in\ncomputer vision. Most VIF methods focus primarily on optimizing fused image\nquality. Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as\nsemantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for\nVIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while\nobject detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with\nsegmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping\nbounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has\ngained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and\ncrowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we\npropose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates\ncrowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct\nquantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it\nparticularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input\nimages and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task\ndesign. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce\na dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate\nadversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting,\nimproving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks.\nExperimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not\nonly enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting\nperformance.", "published": "2025-08-28 14:15:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817v2", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
