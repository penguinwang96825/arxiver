{"title": "Survey:Natural Language Parsing For Indian Languages", "abstract": "Syntactic parsing is a necessary task which is required for NLP applications\nincluding machine translation. It is a challenging task to develop a\nqualitative parser for morphological rich and agglutinative languages.\nSyntactic analysis is used to understand the grammatical structure of a natural\nlanguage sentence. It outputs all the grammatical information of each word and\nits constituent. Also issues related to it help us to understand the language\nin a more detailed way. This literature survey is groundwork to understand the\ndifferent parser development for Indian languages and various approaches that\nare used to develop such tools and techniques. This paper provides a survey of\nresearch papers from well known journals and conferences.", "published": "2015-01-28 07:04:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07005v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
