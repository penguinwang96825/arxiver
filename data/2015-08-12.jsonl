{"title": "Syntax Evolution: Problems and Recursion", "abstract": "To investigate the evolution of syntax, we need to ascertain the evolutionary\nr\\^ole of syntax and, before that, the very nature of syntax. Here, we will\nassume that syntax is computing. And then, since we are computationally Turing\ncomplete, we meet an evolutionary anomaly, the anomaly of sytax: we are\nsyntactically too competent for syntax. Assuming that problem solving is\ncomputing, and realizing that the evolutionary advantage of Turing completeness\nis full problem solving and not syntactic proficiency, we explain the anomaly\nof syntax by postulating that syntax and problem solving co-evolved in humans\ntowards Turing completeness. Examining the requirements that full problem\nsolving impose on language, we find firstly that semantics is not sufficient\nand that syntax is necessary to represent problems. Our final conclusion is\nthat full problem solving requires a functional semantics on an infinite\ntree-structured syntax. Besides these results, the introduction of Turing\ncompleteness and problem solving to explain the evolution of syntax should help\nus to fit the evolution of language within the evolution of cognition, giving\nus some new clues to understand the elusive relation between language and\nthinking.", "published": "2015-08-12 09:04:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03040v7", "categories": ["cs.CL", "91F20, 68T20, 68T50, 92D15", "I.2.7; I.2.8"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
