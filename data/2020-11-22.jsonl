{"title": "Cross-Domain Generalization Through Memorization: A Study of Nearest\n  Neighbors in Neural Duplicate Question Detection", "abstract": "Duplicate question detection (DQD) is important to increase efficiency of\ncommunity and automatic question answering systems. Unfortunately, gathering\nsupervised data in a domain is time-consuming and expensive, and our ability to\nleverage annotations across domains is minimal. In this work, we leverage\nneural representations and study nearest neighbors for cross-domain\ngeneralization in DQD. We first encode question pairs of the source and target\ndomain in a rich representation space and then using a k-nearest neighbour\nretrieval-based method, we aggregate the neighbors' labels and distances to\nrank pairs. We observe robust performance of this method in different\ncross-domain scenarios of StackExchange, Spring and Quora datasets,\noutperforming cross-entropy classification in multiple cases.", "published": "2020-11-22 19:19:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11090v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Employing distributional semantics to organize task-focused vocabulary\n  learning", "abstract": "How can a learner systematically prepare for reading a book they are\ninterested in? In this paper,we explore how computational linguistic methods\nsuch as distributional semantics, morphological clustering, and exercise\ngeneration can be combined with graph-based learner models to answer this\nquestion both conceptually and in practice. Based on the highly structured\nlearner model and concepts from network analysis, the learner is guided to\nefficiently explore the targeted lexical space. They practice using multi-gap\nlearning activities generated from the book focused on words that are central\nto the targeted lexical space. As such the approach offers a unique combination\nof computational linguistic methods with concepts from network analysis and the\ntutoring system domain to support learners in achieving their individual,\nreading task-based learning goals.", "published": "2020-11-22 21:51:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11115v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Modelling Compositionality and Structure Dependence in Natural Language", "abstract": "Human beings possess the most sophisticated computational machinery in the\nknown universe. We can understand language of rich descriptive power, and\ncommunicate in the same environment with astonishing clarity. Two of the many\ncontributors to the interest in natural language - the properties of\nCompositionality and Structure Dependence, are well documented, and offer a\nvast space to ask interesting modelling questions. The first step to begin\nanswering these questions is to ground verbal theory in formal terms. Drawing\non linguistics and set theory, a formalisation of these ideas is presented in\nthe first half of this thesis. We see how cognitive systems that process\nlanguage need to have certain functional constraints, viz. time based,\nincremental operations that rely on a structurally defined domain. The\nobservations that result from analysing this formal setup are examined as part\nof a modelling exercise. Using the advances of word embedding techniques, a\nmodel of relational learning is simulated with a custom dataset to demonstrate\nhow a time based role-filler binding mechanism satisfies some of the\nconstraints described in the first section. The model's ability to map\nstructure, along with its symbolic-connectionist architecture makes for a\ncognitively plausible implementation. The formalisation and simulation are\ntogether an attempt to recognise the constraints imposed by linguistic theory,\nand explore the opportunities presented by a cognitive model of relation\nlearning to realise these constraints.", "published": "2020-11-22 17:28:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02038v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Hierachical Delta-Attention Method for Multimodal Fusion", "abstract": "In vision and linguistics; the main input modalities are facial expressions,\nspeech patterns, and the words uttered. The issue with analysis of any one mode\nof expression (Visual, Verbal or Vocal) is that lot of contextual information\ncan get lost. This asks researchers to inspect multiple modalities to get a\nthorough understanding of the cross-modal dependencies and temporal context of\nthe situation to analyze the expression. This work attempts at preserving the\nlong-range dependencies within and across different modalities, which would be\nbottle-necked by the use of recurrent networks and adds the concept of\ndelta-attention to focus on local differences per modality to capture the\nidiosyncrasy of different people. We explore a cross-attention fusion technique\nto get the global view of the emotion expressed through these\ndelta-self-attended modalities, in order to fuse all the local nuances and\nglobal context together. The addition of attention is new to the multi-modal\nfusion field and currently being scrutinized for on what stage the attention\nmechanism should be used, this work achieves competitive accuracy for overall\nand per-class classification which is close to the current state-of-the-art\nwith almost half number of parameters.", "published": "2020-11-22 02:45:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10916v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

Handwritten numeral datasets are\navailable and accessible for many renowned languages of different regions. In\nthis paper, several handwritten numeral datasets of different languages are\ncollected. Then they are used to find the similarity among those written\nlanguages through determining and comparing the similitude of each handwritten\nnumerals. This will help to find which languages have the same or adjacent\nparent language. Firstly, a similarity measure of two numeral images is\nconstructed with a Siamese network. Secondly, the similarity of the numeral\ndatasets is determined with the help of the Siamese network and a new random\nsample with replacement similarity averaging technique. Finally, an\nagglomerative clustering is done based on the similarities of each dataset.\nThis clustering technique shows some very interesting properties of the\ndatasets. The property focused in this paper is the regional resemblance of the\ndatasets.
