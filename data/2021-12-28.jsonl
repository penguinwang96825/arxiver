We specifically focus\non the parts of the collections that are processed in a way that improves their\nusability in more technical applications, complementing the earlier work on the\ncultural and linguistic aspects of these materials.

{"title": "Simple, Interpretable and Stable Method for Detecting Words with Usage\n  Change across Corpora", "abstract": "The problem of comparing two bodies of text and searching for words that\ndiffer in their usage between them arises often in digital humanities and\ncomputational social science. This is commonly approached by training word\nembeddings on each corpus, aligning the vector spaces, and looking for words\nwhose cosine distance in the aligned space is large. However, these methods\noften require extensive filtering of the vocabulary to perform well, and - as\nwe show in this work - result in unstable, and hence less reliable, results. We\npropose an alternative approach that does not use vector space alignment, and\ninstead considers the neighbors of each word. The method is simple,\ninterpretable and stable. We demonstrate its effectiveness in 9 different\nsetups, considering different corpus splitting criteria (age, gender and\nprofession of tweet authors, time of tweet) and different languages (English,\nFrench and Hebrew).", "published": "2021-12-28 23:46:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14330v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Cognitive Computing to Optimize IT Services", "abstract": "In this paper, the challenges of maintaining a healthy IT operational\nenvironment have been addressed by proactively analyzing IT Service Desk\ntickets, customer satisfaction surveys, and social media data. A Cognitive\nsolution goes beyond the traditional structured data analysis by deep analyses\nof both structured and unstructured text. The salient features of the proposed\nplatform include language identification, translation, hierarchical extraction\nof the most frequently occurring topics, entities and their relationships, text\nsummarization, sentiments, and knowledge extraction from the unstructured text\nusing Natural Language Processing techniques. Moreover, the insights from\nunstructured text combined with structured data allow the development of\nvarious classification, segmentation, and time-series forecasting use-cases on\nthe incident, problem, and change datasets. Further, the text and predictive\ninsights together with raw data are used for visualization and exploration of\nactionable insights on a rich and interactive dashboard. However, it is hard\nnot only to find these insights using traditional structured data analysis but\nit might also take a very long time to discover them, especially while dealing\nwith a massive amount of unstructured data. By taking action on these insights,\norganizations can benefit from a significant reduction of ticket volume,\nreduced operational costs, and increased customer satisfaction. In various\nexperiments, on average, upto 18-25% of yearly ticket volume has been reduced\nusing the proposed approach.", "published": "2021-12-28 09:56:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02737v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "LINDA: Unsupervised Learning to Interpolate in Natural Language\n  Processing", "abstract": "Despite the success of mixup in data augmentation, its applicability to\nnatural language processing (NLP) tasks has been limited due to the discrete\nand variable-length nature of natural languages. Recent studies have thus\nrelied on domain-specific heuristics and manually crafted resources, such as\ndictionaries, in order to apply mixup in NLP. In this paper, we instead propose\nan unsupervised learning approach to text interpolation for the purpose of data\naugmentation, to which we refer as \"Learning to INterpolate for Data\nAugmentation\" (LINDA), that does not require any heuristics nor manually\ncrafted resources but learns to interpolate between any pair of natural\nlanguage sentences over a natural language manifold. After empirically\ndemonstrating the LINDA's interpolation capability, we show that LINDA indeed\nallows us to seamlessly apply mixup in NLP and leads to better generalization\nin text classification both in-domain and out-of-domain.", "published": "2021-12-28 02:56:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13969v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Survey on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing", "abstract": "Language can be used as a means of reproducing and enforcing harmful\nstereotypes and biases and has been analysed as such in numerous research. In\nthis paper, we present a survey of 304 papers on gender bias in natural\nlanguage processing. We analyse definitions of gender and its categories within\nsocial sciences and connect them to formal definitions of gender bias in NLP\nresearch. We survey lexica and datasets applied in research on gender bias and\nthen compare and contrast approaches to detecting and mitigating gender bias.\nWe find that research on gender bias suffers from four core limitations. 1)\nMost research treats gender as a binary variable neglecting its fluidity and\ncontinuity. 2) Most of the work has been conducted in monolingual setups for\nEnglish or other high-resource languages. 3) Despite a myriad of papers on\ngender bias in NLP methods, we find that most of the newly developed algorithms\ndo not test their models for bias and disregard possible ethical considerations\nof their work. 4) Finally, methodologies developed in this line of research are\nfundamentally flawed covering very limited definitions of gender bias and\nlacking evaluation baselines and pipelines.

{"title": "Mirror Matching: Document Matching Approach in Seed-driven Document\n  Ranking for Medical Systematic Reviews", "abstract": "When medical researchers conduct a systematic review (SR), screening studies\nis the most time-consuming process: researchers read several thousands of\nmedical literature and manually label them relevant or irrelevant. Screening\nprioritization (ie., document ranking) is an approach for assisting researchers\nby providing document rankings where relevant documents are ranked higher than\nirrelevant ones. Seed-driven document ranking (SDR) uses a known relevant\ndocument (ie., seed) as a query and generates such rankings. Previous work on\nSDR seeks ways to identify different term weights in a query document and\nutilizes them in a retrieval model to compute ranking scores. Alternatively, we\nformulate the SDR task as finding similar documents to a query document and\nproduce rankings based on similarity scores. We propose a document matching\nmeasure named Mirror Matching, which calculates matching scores between medical\nabstract texts by incorporating common writing patterns, such as background,\nmethod, result, and conclusion in order.

In this paper, we focus on and analyze the\n\\emph{security performance} (SP) of the \\emph{satellite-terrestrial downlink\ntransmission} (STDT). Here, the STDT is composed of a satellite network and a\nvehicular network with a legitimate mobile receiver and an mobile eavesdropper\ndistributing. To theoretically analyze the SP of this system from the\nperspective of mobile terminals better, the random geometry theory is adopted,\nwhich assumes that both terrestrial vehicles are distributed stochastically in\none beam of the satellite. Furthermore, based on this theory, the closed-form\nanalytical expressions for two crucial and specific indicators in the STDT are\nderived, respectively, the secrecy outage probability and the ergodic secrecy\ncapacity. Additionally, several related variables restricting the SP of the\nSTDT are discussed, and specific schemes are presented to enhance the SP. Then,\nthe asymptotic property is investigated in the high signal-to-noise ratio\nscenario, and accurate and asymptotic closed-form expressions are given.\nFinally, simulation results show that, under the precondition of guaranteeing\nthe reliability of the STDT, the asymptotic solutions outperform the\ncorresponding accurate results significantly in the effectiveness.", "published": "2021-12-28 15:46:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14192v2", "categories": ["cs.IT", "cs.CL", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}
