{"title": "Framework for asset-liability management with fixed-term securities", "abstract": "We consider an optimal investment-consumption problem for a\nutility-maximizing investor who has access to assets with different liquidity\nand whose consumption rate as well as terminal wealth are subject to\nlower-bound constraints. Assuming utility functions that satisfy standard\nconditions, we develop a methodology for deriving the optimal strategies in\nsemi-closed form. Our methodology is based on the generalized martingale\napproach and the decomposition of the problem into subproblems. We illustrate\nour approach by deriving explicit formulas for agents with power-utility\nfunctions and discuss potential extensions of the proposed framework.", "published": "2025-02-26 15:14:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19213v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC", "q-fin.PM", "91G10 (Primary), 90B50 (Secondary)"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Corporate Fraud Detection in Rich-yet-Noisy Financial Graph", "abstract": "Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that\nconduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal\ninsider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate\nrich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year\nfinancial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We\nanalyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two\npronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy)\nnon-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in\nGraph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large\npercentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden\nfraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and\ncompromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a\nnovel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage\nLearning (${\\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to\nmitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations.\nThe proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness\nagainst hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the\nimportance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\\rm KeGCN}_{R}$\nover a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and\nrobustness.", "published": "2025-02-26 17:05:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19305v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "q-fin.RM", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
