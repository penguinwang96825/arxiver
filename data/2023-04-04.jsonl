{"title": "Dynamical properties of volume at the spread in the Bitcoin/USD market", "abstract": "The study of order volumes in financial markets has shown that these display several non-trivial statistical properties. Most studies have been focused on the bulk properties of volume of incoming orders or of realized transactions rather than the dynamical aspects. The present work is a study of the dynamical properties of volume. Unlike previous works, we studied the volume available at the spread rather than the volume of incoming orders or of realized transactions. We found evidence that suggests mean reverting volume changes and strong asymmetries in the equilibrium of sell and buy orders as well as the presence of clustering.", "published": "2023-04-04 16:03:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01907v4", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Learning to Predict Short-Term Volatility with Order Flow Image Representation", "abstract": "Introduction: The paper addresses the challenging problem of predicting the short-term realized volatility of the Bitcoin price using order flow information. The inherent stochastic nature and anti-persistence of price pose difficulties in accurate prediction.\n  Methods: To address this, we propose a method that transforms order flow data over a fixed time interval (snapshots) into images. The order flow includes trade sizes, trade directions, and limit order book, and is mapped into image colour channels. These images are then used to train both a simple 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and more advanced ResNet-18 and ConvMixer, with additionally supplementing them with hand-crafted features. The models are evaluated against classical GARCH, Multilayer Perceptron trained on raw data, and a naive guess method that considers current volatility as a prediction.\n  Results: The experiments are conducted using price data from January 2021 and evaluate model performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSPE). The results show that our order flow representation with a CNN as a predictive model achieves the best performance, with an RMSPE of 0.85+/-1.1 for the model with aggregated features and 1.0+/-1.4 for the model without feature supplementation. ConvMixer with feature supplementation follows closely. In comparison, the RMSPE for the naive guess method was 1.4+/-3.0.", "published": "2023-04-04 12:32:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02472v2", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
