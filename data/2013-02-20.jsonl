{"title": "Towards a Semantic-based Approach for Modeling Regulatory Documents in\n  Building Industry", "abstract": "Regulations in the Building Industry are becoming increasingly complex and\ninvolve more than one technical area. They cover products, components and\nproject implementation. They also play an important role to ensure the quality\nof a building, and to minimize its environmental impact. In this paper, we are\nparticularly interested in the modeling of the regulatory constraints derived\nfrom the Technical Guides issued by CSTB and used to validate Technical\nAssessments. We first describe our approach for modeling regulatory constraints\nin the SBVR language, and formalizing them in the SPARQL language. Second, we\ndescribe how we model the processes of compliance checking described in the\nCSTB Technical Guides. Third, we show how we implement these processes to\nassist industrials in drafting Technical Documents in order to acquire a\nTechnical Assessment; a compliance report is automatically generated to explain\nthe compliance or noncompliance of this Technical Documents.", "published": "2013-02-20 05:46:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4811v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Probabilistic Frame Induction", "abstract": "In natural-language discourse, related events tend to appear near each other\nto describe a larger scenario. Such structures can be formalized by the notion\nof a frame (a.k.a. template), which comprises a set of related events and\nprototypical participants and event transitions. Identifying frames is a\nprerequisite for information extraction and natural language generation, and is\nusually done manually. Methods for inducing frames have been proposed recently,\nbut they typically use ad hoc procedures and are difficult to diagnose or\nextend. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic approach to frame\ninduction, which incorporates frames, events, participants as latent topics and\nlearns those frame and event transitions that best explain the text. The number\nof frames is inferred by a novel application of a split-merge method from\nsyntactic parsing. In end-to-end evaluations from text to induced frames and\nextracted facts, our method produced state-of-the-art results while\nsubstantially reducing engineering effort.", "published": "2013-02-20 05:47:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4813v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "NLP and CALL: integration is working", "abstract": "In the first part of this article, we explore the background of\ncomputer-assisted learning from its beginnings in the early XIXth century and\nthe first teaching machines, founded on theories of learning, at the start of\nthe XXth century. With the arrival of the computer, it became possible to offer\nlanguage learners different types of language activities such as comprehension\ntasks, simulations, etc. However, these have limits that cannot be overcome\nwithout some contribution from the field of natural language processing (NLP).\nIn what follows, we examine the challenges faced and the issues raised by\nintegrating NLP into CALL. We hope to demonstrate that the key to success in\nintegrating NLP into CALL is to be found in multidisciplinary work between\ncomputer experts, linguists, language teachers, didacticians and NLP\nspecialists.", "published": "2013-02-20 05:47:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4814v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Labeled Graph Kernel for Relationship Extraction", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach for Relationship Extraction (RE) based\non labeled graph kernels. The kernel we propose is a particularization of a\nrandom walk kernel that exploits two properties previously studied in the RE\nliterature: (i) the words between the candidate entities or connecting them in\na syntactic representation are particularly likely to carry information\nregarding the relationship; and (ii) combining information from distinct\nsources in a kernel may help the RE system make better decisions. We performed\nexperiments on a dataset of protein-protein interactions and the results show\nthat our approach obtains effectiveness values that are comparable with the\nstate-of-the art kernel methods. Moreover, our approach is able to outperform\nthe state-of-the-art kernels when combined with other kernel methods.", "published": "2013-02-20 11:06:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4874v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
