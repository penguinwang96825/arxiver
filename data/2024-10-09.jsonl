{"title": "Simulating and analyzing a sparse order book: an application to intraday electricity markets", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model for simulating and analyzing sparse limit\norder books (LOBs), with a specific application to the European intraday\nelectricity market. In illiquid markets, characterized by significant gaps\nbetween order levels due to sparse trading volumes, traditional LOB models\noften fall short. Our approach utilizes an inhomogeneous Poisson process to\naccurately capture the sporadic nature of order arrivals and cancellations on\nboth the bid and ask sides of the book. By applying this model to the intraday\nelectricity market, we gain insights into the unique microstructural behaviors\nand challenges of this dynamic trading environment. The results offer valuable\nimplications for market participants, enhancing their understanding of LOB\ndynamics in illiquid markets. This work contributes to the broader field of\nmarket microstructure by providing a robust framework adaptable to various\nilliquid market settings beyond electricity trading.", "published": "2024-10-09 12:55:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06839v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "First order Martingale model risk and semi-static hedging", "abstract": "We investigate model risk distributionally robust sensitivities for\nfunctionals on the Wasserstein space when the underlying model is constrained\nto the martingale class and/or is subject to constraints on the first marginal\nlaw. Our results extend the findings of Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \\& Wiesel\n\\cite{bartl2021sensitivity} and Bartl \\& Wiesel \\cite{bartlsensitivityadapted}\nby introducing the minimization of the distributionally robust problem with\nrespect to semi-static hedging strategies. We provide explicit\ncharacterizations of the model risk (first order) optimal semi-static hedging\nstrategies. The distributional robustness is analyzed both in terms of the\nadapted Wasserstein metric and the more relevant standard Wasserstein metric.", "published": "2024-10-09 14:09:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06906v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC", "math.PR", "49K45, 49Q22"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Statistical Arbitrage in Rank Space", "abstract": "Equity market dynamics are conventionally investigated in name space where\nstocks are indexed by company names. In contrast, by indexing stocks based on\ntheir ranks in capitalization, we gain a different perspective of market\ndynamics in rank space. Here, we demonstrate the superior performance of\nstatistical arbitrage in rank space over name space, driven by a robust market\nrepresentation and enhanced mean-reverting properties of residual returns in\nrank space. Our statistical arbitrage algorithm features an intraday\nrebalancing mechanism for effective conversion between portfolios in name and\nrank space. We explore statistical arbitrage with and without neural networks\nin both name and rank space and show that the portfolios obtained in rank space\nwith neural networks significantly outperform those in name space.", "published": "2024-10-09 06:05:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06568v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Generating long-horizon stock \"buy\" signals with a neural language model", "abstract": "This paper describes experiments on fine-tuning a small language model to\ngenerate forecasts of long-horizon stock price movements. Inputs to the model\nare narrative text from 10-K reports of large market capitalization companies\nin the S&P 500 index; the output is a forward-looking buy or sell decision.\nPrice direction is predicted at discrete horizons up to 12 months after the\nreport filing date. The results reported here demonstrate good out-of-sample\nstatistical performance (F1-macro= 0.62) at medium to long investment horizons.\nIn particular, the buy signals generated from 10-K text are found most precise\nat 6 and 9 months in the future. As measured by the F1 score, the buy signal\nprovides between 4.8 and 9 percent improvement against a random stock selection\nmodel. In contrast, sell signals generated by the models do not perform well.\nThis may be attributed to the highly imbalanced out-of-sample data, or perhaps\ndue to management drafting annual reports with a bias toward positive language.\nCross-sectional analysis of performance by economic sector suggests that\nidiosyncratic reporting styles within industries are correlated with varying\ndegrees and time scales of price movement predictability.", "published": "2024-10-09 20:17:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18988v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
