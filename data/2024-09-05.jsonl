{"title": "Optimal position-building strategies in competition", "abstract": "This paper develops a mathematical framework for building a position in a\nstock over a fixed period of time while in competition with one or more other\ntraders doing the same thing. We develop a game-theoretic framework that takes\nplace in the space of trading strategies where action sets are trading\nstrategies and traders try to devise best-response strategies to their\nadversaries. In this setup trading is guided by a desire to minimize the total\ncost of trading arising from a mixture of temporary and permanent market impact\ncaused by the aggregate level of trading including the trader and the\ncompetition. We describe a notion of equilibrium strategies, show that they\nexist and provide closed-form solutions.", "published": "2024-09-05 14:42:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03586v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
