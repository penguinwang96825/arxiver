{"title": "Natural Language Feature Selection via Cooccurrence", "abstract": "Specificity is important for extracting collocations, keyphrases, multi-word\nand index terms [Newman et al. 2012]. It is also useful for tagging, ontology\nconstruction [Ryu and Choi 2006], and automatic summarization of documents\n[Louis and Nenkova 2011, Chali and Hassan 2012]. Term frequency and\ninverse-document frequency (TF-IDF) are typically used to do this, but fail to\ntake advantage of the semantic relationships between terms [Church and Gale\n1995]. The result is that general idiomatic terms are mistaken for specific\nterms. We demonstrate use of relational data for estimation of term\nspecificity. The specificity of a term can be learned from its distribution of\nrelations with other terms. This technique is useful for identifying relevant\nwords or terms for other natural language processing tasks.", "published": "2014-03-08 20:10:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2004v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
