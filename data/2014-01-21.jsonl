{"title": "Compositional Operators in Distributional Semantics", "abstract": "This survey presents in some detail the main advances that have been recently\ntaking place in Computational Linguistics towards the unification of the two\nprominent semantic paradigms: the compositional formal semantics view and the\ndistributional models of meaning based on vector spaces. After an introduction\nto these two approaches, I review the most important models that aim to provide\ncompositionality in distributional semantics. Then I proceed and present in\nmore detail a particular framework by Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark (2010) based\non the abstract mathematical setting of category theory, as a more complete\nexample capable to demonstrate the diversity of techniques and scientific\ndisciplines that this kind of research can draw from. This paper concludes with\na discussion about important open issues that need to be addressed by the\nresearchers in the future.", "published": "2014-01-21 14:28:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5327v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "math.CT"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
