{"title": "Nash Equilibrium between Brokers and Traders", "abstract": "We study the perfect information Nash equilibrium between a broker and her\nclients -- an informed trader and an uniformed trader. In our model, the broker\ntrades in the lit exchange where trades have instantaneous and transient price\nimpact with exponential resilience, while both clients trade with the broker.\nThe informed trader and the broker maximise expected wealth subject to\ninventory penalties, while the uninformed trader is not strategic and sends the\nbroker random buy and sell orders. We characterise the Nash equilibrium of the\ntrading strategies with the solution to a coupled system of forward-backward\nstochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We solve this system explicitly and\nstudy the effect of information, profitability, and inventory control in the\ntrading strategies of the broker and the informed trader.", "published": "2024-07-15 09:23:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10561v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments", "abstract": "Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the\nimpact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics,\npolicy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which\nfrequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for\nmaximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through\nlarge language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system\ncalled StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading\nbehaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to\nevaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to\nanalyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent\navoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation\nsystems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging\nprior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate\ndifferent LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment\nthat closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading,\nincluding trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research\nexplores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior\nknowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent\nsimulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock\nrecommendation.
