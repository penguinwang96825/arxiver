{"title": "A Generalized Language Model as the Combination of Skipped n-grams and\n  Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing", "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach for building language models based on a\nsystematic, recursive exploration of skip n-gram models which are interpolated\nusing modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Our approach generalizes language models\nas it contains the classical interpolation with lower order models as a special\ncase. In this paper we motivate, formalize and present our approach. In an\nextensive empirical experiment over English text corpora we demonstrate that\nour generalized language models lead to a substantial reduction of perplexity\nbetween 3.1% and 12.7% in comparison to traditional language models using\nmodified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, we investigate the behaviour over\nthree other languages and a domain specific corpus where we observed consistent\nimprovements. Finally, we also show that the strength of our approach lies in\nits ability to cope in particular with sparse training data. Using a very small\ntraining data set of only 736 KB text we yield improvements of even 25.7%\nreduction of perplexity.", "published": "2014-04-13 12:39:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3377v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Complexity of Grammar Induction for Quantum Types", "abstract": "Most categorical models of meaning use a functor from the syntactic category\nto the semantic category. When semantic information is available, the problem\nof grammar induction can therefore be defined as finding preimages of the\nsemantic types under this forgetful functor, lifting the information flow from\nthe semantic level to a valid reduction at the syntactic level. We study the\ncomplexity of grammar induction, and show that for a variety of type systems,\nincluding pivotal and compact closed categories, the grammar induction problem\nis NP-complete. Our approach could be extended to linguistic type systems such\nas autonomous or bi-closed categories.", "published": "2014-04-13 14:19:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3925v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.CT"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
