{"title": "On the universal structure of human lexical semantics", "abstract": "How universal is human conceptual structure? The way concepts are organized\nin the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and\nenvironmental background in addition to properties universal to human\ncognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct\naccess to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously\ndifficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical\nmeasure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic\ndictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and\ngeographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases\nwhere a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts\nrepresented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies\nlinking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent\nthe pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly\nuneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than\nothers, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to\neach other. Statistical analysis shows such structural properties are\nconsistent across different language groups, largely independent of geography,\nenvironment, and literacy. It is therefore possible to conclude the conceptual\nstructure connecting basic vocabulary studied is primarily due to universal\nfeatures of human cognition and language use.", "published": "2015-04-29 13:06:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07843v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
