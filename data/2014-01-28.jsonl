{"title": "Quantifying literature quality using complexity criteria", "abstract": "We measured entropy and symbolic diversity for English and Spanish texts\nincluding literature Nobel laureates and other famous authors. Entropy, symbol\ndiversity and symbol frequency profiles were compared for these four groups. We\nalso built a scale sensitive to the quality of writing and evaluated its\nrelationship with the Flesch's readability index for English and the\nSzigriszt's perspicuity index for Spanish. Results suggest a correlation\nbetween entropy and word diversity with quality of writing. Text genre also\ninfluences the resulting entropy and diversity of the text. Results suggest the\nplausibility of automated quality assessment of texts.", "published": "2014-01-28 03:48:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7077v4", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
