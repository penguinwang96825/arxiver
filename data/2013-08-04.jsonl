{"title": "Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper shows how Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural networks can be\nused to generate complex sequences with long-range structure, simply by\npredicting one data point at a time. The approach is demonstrated for text\n(where the data are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are\nreal-valued). It is then extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the\nnetwork to condition its predictions on a text sequence. The resulting system\nis able to generate highly realistic cursive handwriting in a wide variety of\nstyles.", "published": "2013-08-04 21:04:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850v5", "categories": ["cs.NE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.NE"}
