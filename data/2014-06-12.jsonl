{"title": "What is India speaking: The \"Hinglish\" invasion", "abstract": "While language competition models of diachronic language shift are\nincreasingly sophisticated, drawing on sociolinguistic components like variable\nlanguage prestige, distance from language centers and intermediate bilingual\ntransitionary populations, in one significant way they fall short. They fail to\nconsider contact-based outcomes resulting in mixed language practices, e.g.\noutcome scenarios such as creoles or unmarked code switching as an emergent\ncommunicative norm. On these lines something very interesting is uncovered in\nIndia, where traditionally there have been monolingual Hindi speakers and\nHindi/English bilinguals, but virtually no monolingual English speakers. While\nthe Indian census data reports a sharp increase in the proportion of\nHindi/English bilinguals, we argue that the number of Hindi/English bilinguals\nin India is inaccurate, given a new class of urban individuals speaking a mixed\nlect of Hindi and English, popularly known as \"Hinglish\". Based on\npredator-prey, sociolinguistic theories, salient local ecological factors and\nthe rural-urban divide in India, we propose a new mathematical model of\ninteracting monolingual Hindi speakers, Hindi/English bilinguals and Hinglish\nspeakers. The model yields globally asymptotic stable states of coexistence, as\nwell as bilingual extinction. To validate our model, sociolinguistic data from\ndifferent Indian classes are contrasted with census reports: We see that\npurported urban Hindi/English bilinguals are unable to maintain fluent Hindi\nspeech and instead produce Hinglish, whereas rural speakers evidence\nmonolingual Hindi. Thus we present evidence for the first time where an\nunrecognized mixed lect involving English but not \"English\", has possibly taken\nover a sizeable faction of a large global population.", "published": "2014-06-12 21:20:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4824v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.DS"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
