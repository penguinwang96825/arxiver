{"title": "A Survey of Word Reordering in Statistical Machine Translation:\n  Computational Models and Language Phenomena", "abstract": "Word reordering is one of the most difficult aspects of statistical machine\ntranslation (SMT), and an important factor of its quality and efficiency.\nDespite the vast amount of research published to date, the interest of the\ncommunity in this problem has not decreased, and no single method appears to be\nstrongly dominant across language pairs. Instead, the choice of the optimal\napproach for a new translation task still seems to be mostly driven by\nempirical trials. To orientate the reader in this vast and complex research\narea, we present a comprehensive survey of word reordering viewed as a\nstatistical modeling challenge and as a natural language phenomenon. The survey\ndescribes in detail how word reordering is modeled within different\nstring-based and tree-based SMT frameworks and as a stand-alone task, including\nsystematic overviews of the literature in advanced reordering modeling. We then\nquestion why some approaches are more successful than others in different\nlanguage pairs. We argue that, besides measuring the amount of reordering, it\nis important to understand which kinds of reordering occur in a given language\npair. To this end, we conduct a qualitative analysis of word reordering\nphenomena in a diverse sample of language pairs, based on a large collection of\nlinguistic knowledge. Empirical results in the SMT literature are shown to\nsupport the hypothesis that a few linguistic facts can be very useful to\nanticipate the reordering characteristics of a language pair and to select the\nSMT framework that best suits them.", "published": "2015-02-17 15:59:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04938v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
