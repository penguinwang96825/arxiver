{"title": "A Reflective LLM-based Agent to Guide Zero-shot Cryptocurrency Trading", "abstract": "The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial trading has\nprimarily been concentrated within the stock market, aiding in economic and\nfinancial decisions. Yet, the unique opportunities presented by the\ncryptocurrency market, noted for its on-chain data's transparency and the\ncritical influence of off-chain signals like news, remain largely untapped by\nLLMs. This work aims to bridge the gap by developing an LLM-based trading\nagent, CryptoTrade, which uniquely combines the analysis of on-chain and\noff-chain data. This approach leverages the transparency and immutability of\non-chain data, as well as the timeliness and influence of off-chain signals,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market. CryptoTrade\nincorporates a reflective mechanism specifically engineered to refine its daily\ntrading decisions by analyzing the outcomes of prior trading decisions. This\nresearch makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it broadens the\napplicability of LLMs to the domain of cryptocurrency trading. Secondly, it\nestablishes a benchmark for cryptocurrency trading strategies. Through\nextensive experiments, CryptoTrade has demonstrated superior performance in\nmaximizing returns compared to traditional trading strategies and time-series\nbaselines across various cryptocurrencies and market conditions.
