{"title": "Ending-based Strategies for Part-of-speech Tagging", "abstract": "Probabilistic approaches to part-of-speech tagging rely primarily on\nwhole-word statistics about word/tag combinations as well as contextual\ninformation. But experience shows about 4 per cent of tokens encountered in\ntest sets are unknown even when the training set is as large as a million\nwords. Unseen words are tagged using secondary strategies that exploit word\nfeatures such as endings, capitalizations and punctuation marks. In this work,\nword-ending statistics are primary and whole-word statistics are secondary.\nFirst, a tagger was trained and tested on word endings only. Subsequent\nexperiments added back whole-word statistics for the words occurring most\nfrequently in the training set. As grew larger, performance was expected to\nimprove, in the limit performing the same as word-based taggers. Surprisingly,\nthe ending-based tagger initially performed nearly as well as the word-based\ntagger; in the best case, its performance significantly exceeded that of the\nword-based tagger. Lastly, and unexpectedly, an effect of negative returns was\nobserved - as grew larger, performance generally improved and then declined. By\nvarying factors such as ending length and tag-list strategy, we achieved a\nsuccess rate of 97.5 percent.", "published": "2013-02-27 14:13:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6777v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
