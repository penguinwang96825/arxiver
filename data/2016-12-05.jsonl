{"title": "Mapping the Dialog Act Annotations of the LEGO Corpus into the\n  Communicative Functions of ISO 24617-2", "abstract": "In this paper we present strategies for mapping the dialog act annotations of\nthe LEGO corpus into the communicative functions of the ISO 24617-2 standard.\nUsing these strategies, we obtained an additional 347 dialogs annotated\naccording to the standard. This is particularly important given the reduced\namount of existing data in those conditions due to the recency of the standard.\nFurthermore, these are dialogs from a widely explored corpus for dialog related\ntasks. However, its dialog annotations have been neglected due to their high\ndomain-dependency, which renders them unuseful outside the context of the\ncorpus. Thus, through our mapping process, we both obtain more data annotated\naccording to a recent standard and provide useful dialog act annotations for a\nwidely explored corpus in the context of dialog research.", "published": "2016-12-05 15:48:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01404v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "H.1.2; H.3.1"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "We used Neural Networks to Detect Clickbaits: You won't believe what\n  happened Next!", "abstract": "Online content publishers often use catchy headlines for their articles in\norder to attract users to their websites. These headlines, popularly known as\nclickbaits, exploit a user's curiosity gap and lure them to click on links that\noften disappoint them. Existing methods for automatically detecting clickbaits\nrely on heavy feature engineering and domain knowledge. Here, we introduce a\nneural network architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks for detecting\nclickbaits. Our model relies on distributed word representations learned from a\nlarge unannotated corpora, and character embeddings learned via Convolutional\nNeural Networks. Experimental results on a dataset of news headlines show that\nour model outperforms existing techniques for clickbait detection with an\naccuracy of 0.98 with F1-score of 0.98 and ROC-AUC of 0.99.", "published": "2016-12-05 13:18:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01340v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Evolution of Sentiment Analysis - A Review of Research Topics,\n  Venues, and Top Cited Papers", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest growing research areas in computer\nscience, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area.\nWe present a computer-assisted literature review, where we utilize both text\nmining and qualitative coding, and analyze 6,996 papers from Scopus. We find\nthat the roots of sentiment analysis are in the studies on public opinion\nanalysis at the beginning of 20th century and in the text subjectivity analysis\nperformed by the computational linguistics community in 1990's. However, the\noutbreak of computer-based sentiment analysis only occurred with the\navailability of subjective texts on the Web. Consequently, 99% of the papers\nhave been published after 2004. Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to\nmultiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top-15\nvenues only represent ca. 30% of the papers in total. We present the top-20\ncited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics.\nIn recent years, sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing online product\nreviews to social media texts from Twitter and Facebook. Many topics beyond\nproduct reviews like stock markets, elections, disasters, medicine, software\nengineering and cyberbullying extend the utilization of sentiment analysis", "published": "2016-12-05 21:28:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01556v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
