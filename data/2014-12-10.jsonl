{"title": "Statistical Patterns in Written Language", "abstract": "Quantitative linguistics has been allowed, in the last few decades, within\nthe admittedly blurry boundaries of the field of complex systems. A growing\nhost of applied mathematicians and statistical physicists devote their efforts\nto disclose regularities, correlations, patterns, and structural properties of\nlanguage streams, using techniques borrowed from statistics and information\ntheory. Overall, results can still be categorized as modest, but the prospects\nare promising: medium- and long-range features in the organization of human\nlanguage -which are beyond the scope of traditional linguistics- have already\nemerged from this kind of analysis and continue to be reported, contributing a\nnew perspective to our understanding of this most complex communication system.\nThis short book is intended to review some of these recent contributions.", "published": "2014-12-10 15:22:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3336v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
