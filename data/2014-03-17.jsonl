{"title": "Measuring Global Similarity between Texts", "abstract": "We propose a new similarity measure between texts which, contrary to the\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches, takes a global view of the texts to be\ncompared. We have implemented a tool to compute our textual distance and\nconducted experiments on several corpuses of texts. The experiments show that\nour methods can reliably identify different global types of texts.", "published": "2014-03-17 08:22:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4024v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
