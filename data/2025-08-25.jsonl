{"title": "MIRAGE: Scaling Test-Time Inference with Parallel Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Chains", "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time\nscaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1\nintegrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning\nprocesses but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating\nunstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a\nresult, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the\nreasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical\nquestion-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain\nInference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time\nscalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over\nstructured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex\nqueries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference\nchains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop\ntraversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve\ncontradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,\nCMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,\nTree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both\nautomatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability\nby generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to\nconcrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex\nmedical reasoning scenarios.

To move beyond this\nlimitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic\nframework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents\nbased on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that\nrequire explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural\nlanguage intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and\norchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a\nself-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time\nscales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to\nnetwork-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is\nthe AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent\ninteractions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control\nalgorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of\nfunctions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We\ndemonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing\nuser demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing\nrigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G\nnetworks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet\noperator goals.", "published": "2025-08-25 08:18:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17778v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.NI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

Moreover, it lacks a generic\ncriterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this\nlimitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to\nselect informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage.

In this paper, we\npresent an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency\nbias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting\nmechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their\nspatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual\nToken Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated\ninto existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model\narchitecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that\nour method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal\ncomputational overhead.", "published": "2025-08-25 08:56:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17807v1", "categories": ["cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

We employ Vision Transformer\n(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are\nfused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our\nresults show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score\nprediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1\n(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently\ndominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential\nsub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.\nFurther analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,\nwhere the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more\ncomplex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved\nmultimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced\nlearning.

{"title": "Steerable Invariant Beamformer Using a Differential Line Array of Omnidirectional and Directional Microphones with Null Constraints", "abstract": "Line differential microphone arrays have attracted attention for their\nability to achieve frequency-invariant beampatterns and high directivity.\nRecently, the Jacobi-Anger expansion-based approach has enabled the design of\nfully steerable-invariant differential beamformers for line arrays combining\nomnidirectional and directional microphones. However, this approach relies on\nthe analytical expression of the ideal beam pattern and the proper selection of\ntruncation order, which is not always practical. This paper introduces a\nnull-constraint-based method for designing frequency- and steerable-invariant\ndifferential beamformers using a line array of omnidirectional and directional\nmicrophones. The approach employs a multi-constraint optimisation framework,\nwhere the reference filter and ideal beam pattern are first determined based on\nspecified nulls and desired direction. Subsequently, the white noise gain\nconstraint is derived from the reference filter, and the beampattern constraint\nis from the ideal beam pattern. The optimal filter is then obtained by\nconsidering constraints related to the beampattern, nulls, and white noise\ngain. This method achieves a balance between white noise gain and mean square\nerror, allowing robust, frequency- and steerableinvariant differential\nbeamforming performance. It addresses limitations in beam pattern flexibility\nand truncation errors, offering greater design freedom and improved practical\napplicability. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that this method\noutperforms the Jacobi-Anger expansion-based approach in three key aspects: an\nextended effective range, improved main lobe and null alignment, and greater\nflexibility in microphone array configuration and beam pattern design,\nrequiring only steering direction and nulls instead of an analytic beam pattern\nexpression.", "published": "2025-08-25 02:28:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17607v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}

{"title": "Context-Aware Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Using Contrastive and Predictive Spatiotemporal Modeling", "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to\ntheir unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel\ncontext-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal\nevents without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed\nhybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal\ndynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to\nextract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future\nrepresentations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based\nsemantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through\ncontext-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using\nInfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic\nrepresentations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by\nmodulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By\nintegrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system\ncan generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This\nframework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in\nzero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance.

A key innovation is the Cascade\nReinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through\na two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for\nrefined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial\nimprovements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To\noptimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that\ndynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising\nperformance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)\nstrategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,\neffectively balancing computational load.

{"title": "PCR-CA: Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment for Multiple-Category App Recommendation", "abstract": "Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as\ntraditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to\nsuboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook\nRepresentations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for\nimproved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings\nfrom app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns\ndiscrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --\nunlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables\nindependent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better\nmodeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative\nsignals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item\nlevels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a\ndual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to\ncapture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a\nlarge-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong\nbaselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps.

{"title": "Vocoder-Projected Feature Discriminator", "abstract": "In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as\nmel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing\nto their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal\nis to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these\nfeatures into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is\nreasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time\nand memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected\nfeature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial\ntraining. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a\npretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step\nis necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of\nwaveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption\nby 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.", "published": "2025-08-25 10:29:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17874v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "ST-Raptor: LLM-Powered Semi-Structured Table Question Answering", "abstract": "Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,\nfinancial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve\nflexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).\nThese tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and\nanswer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To\nautomate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,\nmethods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured\nones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like\nNL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of\nsemi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To\nthis end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured\ntable question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables.
