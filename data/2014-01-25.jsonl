{"title": "A Machine Learning Approach for the Identification of Bengali Noun-Noun\n  Compound Multiword Expressions", "abstract": "This paper presents a machine learning approach for identification of Bengali\nmultiword expressions (MWE) which are bigram nominal compounds. Our proposed\napproach has two steps: (1) candidate extraction using chunk information and\nvarious heuristic rules and (2) training the machine learning algorithm called\nRandom Forest to classify the candidates into two groups: bigram nominal\ncompound MWE or not bigram nominal compound MWE. A variety of association\nmeasures, syntactic and linguistic clues and a set of WordNet-based similarity\nfeatures have been used for our MWE identification task. The approach presented\nin this paper can be used to identify bigram nominal compound MWE in Bengali\nrunning text.", "published": "2014-01-25 18:45:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6567v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Keyword and Keyphrase Extraction Using Centrality Measures on\n  Collocation Networks", "abstract": "Keyword and keyphrase extraction is an important problem in natural language\nprocessing, with applications ranging from summarization to semantic search to\ndocument clustering. Graph-based approaches to keyword and keyphrase extraction\navoid the problem of acquiring a large in-domain training corpus by applying\nvariants of PageRank algorithm on a network of words. Although graph-based\napproaches are knowledge-lean and easily adoptable in online systems, it\nremains largely open whether they can benefit from centrality measures other\nthan PageRank. In this paper, we experiment with an array of centrality\nmeasures on word and noun phrase collocation networks, and analyze their\nperformance on four benchmark datasets. Not only are there centrality measures\nthat perform as well as or better than PageRank, but they are much simpler\n(e.g., degree, strength, and neighborhood size). Furthermore, centrality-based\nmethods give results that are competitive with and, in some cases, better than\ntwo strong unsupervised baselines.", "published": "2014-01-25 19:05:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6571v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Deverbal semantics and the Montagovian generative lexicon", "abstract": "We propose a lexical account of action nominals, in particular of deverbal\nnominalisations, whose meaning is related to the event expressed by their base\nverb. The literature about nominalisations often assumes that the semantics of\nthe base verb completely defines the structure of action nominals. We argue\nthat the information in the base verb is not sufficient to completely determine\nthe semantics of action nominals. We exhibit some data from different\nlanguages, especially from Romance language, which show that nominalisations\nfocus on some aspects of the verb semantics. The selected aspects, however,\nseem to be idiosyncratic and do not automatically result from the internal\nstructure of the verb nor from its interaction with the morphological suffix.\nWe therefore propose a partially lexicalist approach view of deverbal nouns. It\nis made precise and computable by using the Montagovian Generative Lexicon, a\ntype theoretical framework introduced by Bassac, Mery and Retor\\'e in this\njournal in 2010. This extension of Montague semantics with a richer type system\neasily incorporates lexical phenomena like the semantics of action nominals in\nparticular deverbals, including their polysemy and (in)felicitous\ncopredications.", "published": "2014-01-25 19:50:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6573v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
