{"title": "Dirichlet-vMF Mixture Model", "abstract": "This document is about the multi-document Von-Mises-Fisher mixture model with\na Dirichlet prior, referred to as VMFMix. VMFMix is analogous to Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) in that they can capture the co-occurrence patterns\nacorss multiple documents. The difference is that in VMFMix, the topic-word\ndistribution is defined on a continuous n-dimensional hypersphere. Hence VMFMix\nis used to derive topic embeddings, i.e., representative vectors, from multiple\nsets of embedding vectors. An efficient Variational Expectation-Maximization\ninference algorithm is derived. The performance of VMFMix on two document\nclassification tasks is reported, with some preliminary analysis.", "published": "2017-02-24 08:35:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07495v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Use Generalized Representations, But Do Not Forget Surface Features", "abstract": "Only a year ago, all state-of-the-art coreference resolvers were using an\nextensive amount of surface features. Recently, there was a paradigm shift\ntowards using word embeddings and deep neural networks, where the use of\nsurface features is very limited. In this paper, we show that a simple SVM\nmodel with surface features outperforms more complex neural models for\ndetecting anaphoric mentions. Our analysis suggests that using generalized\nrepresentations and surface features have different strength that should be\nboth taken into account for improving coreference resolution.", "published": "2017-02-24 09:26:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07507v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Residual Convolutional CTC Networks for Automatic Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Deep learning approaches have been widely used in Automatic Speech\nRecognition (ASR) and they have achieved a significant accuracy improvement.\nEspecially, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been revisited in ASR\nrecently. However, most CNNs used in existing work have less than 10 layers\nwhich may not be deep enough to capture all human speech signal information. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel deep and wide CNN architecture denoted as\nRCNN-CTC, which has residual connections and Connectionist Temporal\nClassification (CTC) loss function. RCNN-CTC is an end-to-end system which can\nexploit temporal and spectral structures of speech signals simultaneously.\nFurthermore, we introduce a CTC-based system combination, which is different\nfrom the conventional frame-wise senone-based one. The basic subsystems adopted\nin the combination are different types and thus mutually complementary to each\nother. Experimental results show that our proposed single system RCNN-CTC can\nachieve the lowest word error rate (WER) on WSJ and Tencent Chat data sets,\ncompared to several widely used neural network systems in ASR. In addition, the\nproposed system combination can offer a further error reduction on these two\ndata sets, resulting in relative WER reductions of $14.91\\%$ and $6.52\\%$ on\nWSJ dev93 and Tencent Chat data sets respectively.", "published": "2017-02-24 22:49:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07793v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

By\npositive speech we understand speech that works for the betterment of a given\nsituation, in this case relations between different communities in a\nconflict-prone country. We worked with four Twitter data sets. Through\nsemi-manual opinion mining, we found that positive speech accounted for < 1% of\nthe data .

{"title": "Normalisation de la langue et de lecriture arabe : enjeux culturels\n  regionaux et mondiaux", "abstract": "Arabic language and writing are now facing a resurgence of international\nnormative solutions that challenge most of their local or network based\noperating principles. Even if the multilingual digital coding solutions,\nespecially those proposed by Unicode, have solved many difficulties of Arabic\nwriting, the linguistic aspect is still in search of more adapted solutions.\nTerminology is one of the sectors in which the Arabic language requires a deep\nmodernization of its classical productivity models.

{"title": "Consistent Alignment of Word Embedding Models", "abstract": "Word embedding models offer continuous vector representations that can\ncapture rich contextual semantics based on their word co-occurrence patterns.\nWhile these word vectors can provide very effective features used in many NLP\ntasks such as clustering similar words and inferring learning relationships,\nmany challenges and open research questions remain. In this paper, we propose a\nsolution that aligns variations of the same model (or different models) in a\njoint low-dimensional latent space leveraging carefully generated synthetic\ndata points. This generative process is inspired by the observation that a\nvariety of linguistic relationships is captured by simple linear operations in\nembedded space.

{"title": "When confidence and competence collide: Effects on online\n  decision-making discussions", "abstract": "Group discussions are a way for individuals to exchange ideas and arguments\nin order to reach better decisions than they could on their own. One of the\npremises of productive discussions is that better solutions will prevail, and\nthat the idea selection process is mediated by the (relative) competence of the\nindividuals involved. However, since people may not know their actual\ncompetence on a new task, their behavior is influenced by their self-estimated\ncompetence --- that is, their confidence --- which can be misaligned with their\nactual competence.\n  Our goal in this work is to understand the effects of confidence-competence\nmisalignment on the dynamics and outcomes of discussions. To this end, we\ndesign a large-scale natural setting, in the form of an online team-based\ngeography game, that allows us to disentangle confidence from competence and\nthus separate their effects.\n  We find that in task-oriented discussions, the more-confident individuals\nhave a larger impact on the group's decisions even when these individuals are\nat the same level of competence as their teammates. Furthermore, this\nunjustified role of confidence in the decision-making process often leads teams\nto under-perform. We explore this phenomenon by investigating the effects of\nconfidence on conversational dynamics.", "published": "2017-02-24 19:00:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07717v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.HC", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
