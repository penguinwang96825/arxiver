{"title": "Substitute Based SCODE Word Embeddings in Supervised NLP Tasks", "abstract": "We analyze a word embedding method in supervised tasks. It maps words on a\nsphere such that words co-occurring in similar contexts lie closely. The\nsimilarity of contexts is measured by the distribution of substitutes that can\nfill them. We compared word embeddings, including more recent representations,\nin Named Entity Recognition (NER), Chunking, and Dependency Parsing. We examine\nour framework in multilingual dependency parsing as well. The results show that\nthe proposed method achieves as good as or better results compared to the other\nword embeddings in the tasks we investigate. It achieves state-of-the-art\nresults in multilingual dependency parsing. Word embeddings in 7 languages are\navailable for public use.", "published": "2014-07-25 11:17:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6853v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Interpretable Low-Rank Document Representations with Label-Dependent\n  Sparsity Patterns", "abstract": "In context of document classification, where in a corpus of documents their\nlabel tags are readily known, an opportunity lies in utilizing label\ninformation to learn document representation spaces with better discriminative\nproperties. To this end, in this paper application of a Variational Bayesian\nSupervised Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (supervised vbNMF) with\nlabel-driven sparsity structure of coefficients is proposed for learning of\ndiscriminative nonsubtractive latent semantic components occuring in TF-IDF\ndocument representations. Constraints are such that the components pursued are\nmade to be frequently occuring in a small set of labels only, making it\npossible to yield document representations with distinctive label-specific\nsparse activation patterns. A simple measure of quality of this kind of\nsparsity structure, dubbed inter-label sparsity, is introduced and\nexperimentally brought into tight connection with classification performance.\nRepresenting a great practical convenience, inter-label sparsity is shown to be\neasily controlled in supervised vbNMF by a single parameter.", "published": "2014-07-25 12:46:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6872v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
