{"title": "Deep Learning for Options Trading: An End-To-End Approach", "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to options trading strategies using a highly\nscalable and data-driven machine learning algorithm. In contrast to traditional\napproaches that often require specifications of underlying market dynamics or\nassumptions on an option pricing model, our models depart fundamentally from\nthe need for these prerequisites, directly learning non-trivial mappings from\nmarket data to optimal trading signals. Backtesting on more than a decade of\noption contracts for equities listed on the S&P 100, we demonstrate that deep\nlearning models trained according to our end-to-end approach exhibit\nsignificant improvements in risk-adjusted performance over existing rules-based\ntrading strategies. We find that incorporating turnover regularization into the\nmodels leads to further performance enhancements at prohibitively high levels\nof transaction costs.", "published": "2024-07-31 17:59:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21791v1", "categories": ["q-fin.PM", "cs.LG", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.PM"}
