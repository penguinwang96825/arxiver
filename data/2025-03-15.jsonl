{"title": "Vote Delegation in DeFi Governance", "abstract": "We investigate the drivers of vote delegation in Decentralized Autonomous\nOrganizations (DAOs), using the Uniswap governance DAO as a laboratory. We show\nthat parties with fewer self-owned votes and those affiliated with the\ncontrolling venture capital firm, Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), receive more vote\ndelegations. These patterns suggest that while the Uniswap ecosystem values\ndecentralization, a16z may engage in window-dressing around it. Moreover, we\nfind that an active and successful track record in submitting improvement\nproposals, especially in the final stage, leads to more vote delegations,\nindicating that delegation in DAOs is at least partly reputation- or\nmerit-based. Combined, our findings provide new insights into how governance\nand decentralization operate in DeFi.", "published": "2025-03-15 01:15:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11940v1", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.GN"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
