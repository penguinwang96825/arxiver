The WSD algorithm is used to find the\nefficient and accurate sense of a word based on domain information. The\naccuracy of this work is evaluated with the aim of finding best suitable domain\nof word.", "published": "2013-04-25 10:25:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.7282v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
