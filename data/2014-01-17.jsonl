{"title": "Entropy analysis of word-length series of natural language texts:\n  Effects of text language and genre", "abstract": "We estimate the $n$-gram entropies of natural language texts in word-length\nrepresentation and find that these are sensitive to text language and genre. We\nattribute this sensitivity to changes in the probability distribution of the\nlengths of single words and emphasize the crucial role of the uniformity of\nprobabilities of having words with length between five and ten. Furthermore,\ncomparison with the entropies of shuffled data reveals the impact of word\nlength correlations on the estimated $n$-gram entropies.", "published": "2014-01-17 00:00:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4205v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "physics.data-an"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
