{"title": "A Factoid Question Answering System for Vietnamese", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the development of an end-to-end factoid question\nanswering system for the Vietnamese language. This system combines both\nstatistical models and ontology-based methods in a chain of processing modules\nto provide high-quality mappings from natural language text to entities. We\npresent the challenges in the development of such an intelligent user interface\nfor an isolating language like Vietnamese and show that techniques developed\nfor inflectional languages cannot be applied \"as is\".

{"title": "Lexico-acoustic Neural-based Models for Dialog Act Classification", "abstract": "Recent works have proposed neural models for dialog act classification in\nspoken dialogs. However, they have not explored the role and the usefulness of\nacoustic information. We propose a neural model that processes both lexical and\nacoustic features for classification. Our results on two benchmark datasets\nreveal that acoustic features are helpful in improving the overall accuracy.\nFinally, a deeper analysis shows that acoustic features are valuable in three\ncases: when a dialog act has sufficient data, when lexical information is\nlimited and when strong lexical cues are not present.", "published": "2018-03-02 12:59:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00831v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Hybrid Model For Word Prediction Using Naive Bayes and Latent\n  Information", "abstract": "Historically, the Natural Language Processing area has been given too much\nattention by many researchers. One of the main motivation beyond this interest\nis related to the word prediction problem, which states that given a set words\nin a sentence, one can recommend the next word. In literature, this problem is\nsolved by methods based on syntactic or semantic analysis. Solely, each of\nthese analysis cannot achieve practical results for end-user applications. For\ninstance, the Latent Semantic Analysis can handle semantic features of text,\nbut cannot suggest words considering syntactical rules. On the other hand,\nthere are models that treat both methods together and achieve state-of-the-art\nresults, e.g. Deep Learning. These models can demand high computational effort,\nwhich can make the model infeasible for certain types of applications. With the\nadvance of the technology and mathematical models, it is possible to develop\nfaster systems with more accuracy. This work proposes a hybrid word suggestion\nmodel, based on Naive Bayes and Latent Semantic Analysis, considering\nneighbouring words around unfilled gaps. Results show that this model could\nachieve 44.2% of accuracy in the MSR Sentence Completion Challenge.", "published": "2018-03-02 18:34:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00985v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

{"title": "Towards a Question Answering System over the Semantic Web", "abstract": "Thanks to the development of the Semantic Web, a lot of new structured data\nhas become available on the Web in the form of knowledge bases (KBs). Making\nthis valuable data accessible and usable for end-users is one of the main goals\nof Question Answering (QA) over KBs. Most current QA systems query one KB, in\none language (namely English). The existing approaches are not designed to be\neasily adaptable to new KBs and languages. We first introduce a new approach\nfor translating natural language questions to SPARQL queries. It is able to\nquery several KBs simultaneously, in different languages, and can easily be\nported to other KBs and languages. In our evaluation, the impact of our\napproach is proven using 5 different well-known and large KBs: Wikidata,\nDBpedia, MusicBrainz, DBLP and Freebase as well as 5 different languages namely\nEnglish, German, French, Italian and Spanish. Second, we show how we integrated\nour approach, to make it easily accessible by the research community and by\nend-users. To summarize, we provided a conceptional solution for multilingual,\nKB-agnostic Question Answering over the Semantic Web.

{"title": "Syntax-Aware Language Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Neural language models (LMs) are typically trained using only lexical\nfeatures, such as surface forms of words. In this paper, we argue this deprives\nthe LM of crucial syntactic signals that can be detected at high confidence\nusing existing parsers. We present a simple but highly effective approach for\ntraining neural LMs using both lexical and syntactic information, and a novel\napproach for applying such LMs to unparsed text using sequential Monte Carlo\nsampling. In experiments on a range of corpora and corpus sizes, we show our\napproach consistently outperforms standard lexical LMs in character-level\nlanguage modeling; on the other hand, for word-level models the models are on a\npar with standard language models. These results indicate potential for\nexpanding LMs beyond lexical surface features to higher-level NLP features for\ncharacter-level models.", "published": "2018-03-02 14:47:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03665v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
