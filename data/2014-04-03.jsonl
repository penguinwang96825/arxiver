{"title": "Application of Ontologies in Identifying Requirements Patterns in Use\n  Cases", "abstract": "Use case specifications have successfully been used for requirements\ndescription. They allow joining, in the same modeling space, the expectations\nof the stakeholders as well as the needs of the software engineer and analyst\ninvolved in the process. While use cases are not meant to describe a system's\nimplementation, by formalizing their description we are able to extract\nimplementation relevant information from them. More specifically, we are\ninterested in identifying requirements patterns (common requirements with\ntypical implementation solutions) in support for a requirements based software\ndevelopment approach. In the paper we propose the transformation of Use Case\ndescriptions expressed in a Controlled Natural Language into an ontology\nexpressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL's query engines can then be\nused to identify requirements patterns expressed as queries over the ontology.\nWe describe a tool that we have developed to support the approach and provide\nan example of usage.", "published": "2014-04-03 10:44:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0850v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "D.2.1; D.2.2; D.2.10"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
