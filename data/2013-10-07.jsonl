{"title": "Named entity recognition using conditional random fields with non-local\n  relational constraints", "abstract": "We begin by introducing the Computer Science branch of Natural Language\nProcessing, then narrowing the attention on its subbranch of Information\nExtraction and particularly on Named Entity Recognition, discussing briefly its\nmain methodological approaches. It follows an introduction to state-of-the-art\nConditional Random Fields under the form of linear chains. Subsequently, the\nidea of constrained inference as a way to model long-distance relationships in\na text is presented, based on an Integer Linear Programming representation of\nthe problem. Adding such relationships to the problem as automatically inferred\nlogical formulas, translatable into linear conditions, we propose to solve the\nresulting more complex problem with the aid of Lagrangian relaxation, of which\nsome technical details are explained. Lastly, we give some experimental\nresults.", "published": "2013-10-07 22:08:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1964v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
