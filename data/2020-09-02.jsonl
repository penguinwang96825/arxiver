{"title": "Combining Determinism and Indeterminism", "abstract": "Our goal is to construct mathematical operations that combine indeterminism measured from quantum randomness with computational determinism so that non-mechanistic behavior is preserved in the computation. Formally, some results about operations applied to computably enumerable (c.e.) and bi-immune sets are proven here, where the objective is for the operations to preserve bi-immunity. While developing rearrangement operations on the natural numbers, we discovered that the bi-immune rearrangements generate an uncountable subgroup of the infinite symmetric group (Sym$(\\mathbb{N})$) on the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$.\n  This new uncountable subgroup is called the bi-immune symmetric group. We show that the bi-immune symmetric group contains the finitary symmetric group on the natural numbers, and consequently is highly transitive. Furthermore, the bi-immune symmetric group is dense in Sym$(\\mathbb{N})$ with respect to the pointwise convergence topology. The complete structure of the bi-immune symmetric group and its subgroups generated by one or more bi-immune rearrangements is unknown.", "published": "2020-09-02 01:30:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03996v4", "categories": ["math.LO", "cs.CC", "cs.CL", "math.GR"], "primary_category": "math.LO"}
{"title": "On Population-Based Algorithms for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems", "abstract": "Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are a widely studied class of optimization problems in which interaction between a set of cooperative agents are modeled as a set of constraints. DCOPs are NP-hard and significant effort has been devoted to developing methods for finding incomplete solutions. In this paper, we study an emerging class of such incomplete algorithms that are broadly termed as population-based algorithms. The main characteristic of these algorithms is that they maintain a population of candidate solutions of a given problem and use this population to cover a large area of the search space and to avoid local-optima. In recent years, this class of algorithms has gained significant attention due to their ability to produce high-quality incomplete solutions. With the primary goal of further improving the quality of solutions compared to the state-of-the-art incomplete DCOP algorithms, we present two new population-based algorithms in this paper. Our first approach, Anytime Evolutionary DCOP or AED, exploits evolutionary optimization meta-heuristics to solve DCOPs. We also present a novel anytime update mechanism that gives AED its anytime property. While in our second contribution, we show that population-based approaches can be combined with local search approaches. Specifically, we develop an algorithm called DPSA based on the Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic. We empirically evaluate these two algorithms to illustrate their respective effectiveness in different settings against the state-of-the-art incomplete DCOP algorithms including all existing population-based algorithms in a wide variety of benchmarks. Our evaluation shows AED and DPSA markedly outperform the state-of-the-art and produce up to 75% improved solutions.", "published": "2020-09-02 06:39:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01625v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Weak error rates for option pricing under linear rough volatility", "abstract": "In quantitative finance, modeling the volatility structure of underlying assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data based on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, $H < 1/2$, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that $H$ often takes values close to $0.1$ or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change improves the fit to both option prices and time series of underlying asset prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only $H$. We prove rate $H + 1/2$ for the weak convergence of the Euler method for the rough Stein-Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one for the case of quadratic payoff functions. Our proof uses Talay-Tubaro expansions and an affine Markovian representation of the underlying and is further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a first step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian motion.", "published": "2020-09-02 17:51:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01219v3", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.NA", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Speaker Representation Learning using Global Context Guided Channel and Time-Frequency Transformations", "abstract": "In this study, we propose the global context guided channel and time-frequency transformations to model the long-range, non-local time-frequency dependencies and channel variances in speaker representations. We use the global context information to enhance important channels and recalibrate salient time-frequency locations by computing the similarity between the global context and local features. The proposed modules, together with a popular ResNet based model, are evaluated on the VoxCeleb1 dataset, which is a large scale speaker verification corpus collected in the wild. This lightweight block can be easily incorporated into a CNN model with little additional computational costs and effectively improves the speaker verification performance compared to the baseline ResNet-LDE model and the Squeeze&Excitation block by a large margin. Detailed ablation studies are also performed to analyze various factors that may impact the performance of the proposed modules. We find that by employing the proposed L2-tf-GTFC transformation block, the Equal Error Rate decreases from 4.56% to 3.07%, a relative 32.68% reduction, and a relative 27.28% improvement in terms of the DCF score. The results indicate that our proposed global context guided transformation modules can efficiently improve the learned speaker representations by achieving time-frequency and channel-wise feature recalibration.", "published": "2020-09-02 01:07:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00768v2", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
