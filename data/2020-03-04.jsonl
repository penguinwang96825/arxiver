{"title": "PDGM: a Neural Network Approach to Solve Path-Dependent Partial Differential Equations", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel numerical method for Path-Dependent Partial Differential Equations (PPDEs). These equations firstly appeared in the seminal work of Dupire [2009], where the functional It\u00f4 calculus was developed to deal with path-dependent financial derivatives contracts. More specificaly, we generalize the Deep Galerking Method (DGM) of Sirignano and Spiliopoulos [2018] to deal with these equations. The method, which we call Path-Dependent DGM (PDGM), consists of using a combination of feed-forward and Long Short-Term Memory architectures to model the solution of the PPDE. We then analyze several numerical examples, many from the Financial Mathematics literature, that show the capabilities of the method under very different situations.", "published": "2020-03-04 12:26:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02035v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Learning Fast Adaptation on Cross-Accented Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Local dialects influence people to pronounce words of the same language differently from each other. The great variability and complex characteristics of accents creates a major challenge for training a robust and accent-agnostic automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, we introduce a cross-accented English speech recognition task as a benchmark for measuring the ability of the model to adapt to unseen accents using the existing CommonVoice corpus. We also propose an accent-agnostic approach that extends the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm for fast adaptation to unseen accents. Our approach significantly outperforms joint training in both zero-shot, few-shot, and all-shot in the mixed-region and cross-region settings in terms of word error rate.", "published": "2020-03-04 05:37:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01901v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
