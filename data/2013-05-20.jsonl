{"title": "Random crossings in dependency trees", "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the rather small number of crossings in real\nsyntactic dependency trees is a side-effect of pressure for dependency length\nminimization. Here we answer a related important research question: what would\nbe the expected number of crossings if the natural order of a sentence was lost\nand replaced by a random ordering? We show that this number depends only on the\nnumber of vertices of the dependency tree (the sentence length) and the second\nmoment about zero of vertex degrees. The expected number of crossings is\nminimum for a star tree (crossings are impossible) and maximum for a linear\ntree (the number of crossings is of the order of the square of the sequence\nlength).", "published": "2013-05-20 15:44:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4561v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DM", "cs.SI", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
