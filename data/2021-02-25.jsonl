{"title": "Deep Equal Risk Pricing of Financial Derivatives with Multiple Hedging Instruments", "abstract": "This paper studies the equal risk pricing (ERP) framework for the valuation of European financial derivatives. This option pricing approach is consistent with global trading strategies by setting the premium as the value such that the residual hedging risk of the long and short positions in the option are equal under optimal hedging. The ERP setup of Marzban et al. (2020) is considered where residual hedging risk is quantified with convex risk measures. The main objective of this paper is to assess through extensive numerical experiments the impact of including options as hedging instruments within the ERP framework. The reinforcement learning procedure developed in Carbonneau and Godin (2020), which relies on the deep hedging algorithm of Buehler et al. (2019b), is applied to numerically solve the global hedging problems by representing trading policies with neural networks. Among other findings, numerical results indicate that in the presence of jump risk, hedging long-term puts with shorter-term options entails a significant decrease of both equal risk prices and market incompleteness as compared to trading only the stock. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the potential of ERP as a fair valuation approach providing prices consistent with observable market prices. Analyses exhibit the ability of ERP to span a large interval of prices through the choice of convex risk measures which is close to encompass the variance-optimal premium.", "published": "2021-02-25 05:45:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12694v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "math.OC", "q-fin.RM"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
