{"title": "Hard to Solve Instances of the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem", "abstract": "The well known $4/3$ conjecture states that the integrality ratio of the subtour LP is at most $4/3$ for metric Traveling Salesman instances. We present a family of Euclidean Traveling Salesman instances for which we prove that the integrality ratio of the subtour LP converges to $4/3$. These instances (using the rounded Euclidean norm) turn out to be hard to solve exactly with Concorde, the fastest existing exact TSP solver. For a 200 vertex instance from our family of Euclidean Traveling Salesman instances Concorde needs several days of CPU time. This is more than 1,000,000 times the runtime for a TSPLIB instance of similar size. Thus our new family of Euclidean Traveling Salesman instances may serve as new benchmark instances for TSP algorithms.", "published": "2018-08-08 16:58:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02859v3", "categories": ["cs.DM", "cs.CC", "cs.DS", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Packing colouring of some classes of cubic graphs", "abstract": "The packing chromatic number $\u03c7$ $\u03c1$ (G) of a graph G is the smallest integer k such that its set of vertices V (G) can be partitioned into k disjoint subsets V 1 ,. .. , V k , in such a way that every two distinct vertices in V i are at distance greater than i in G for every i, 1 $\\le$ i $\\le$ k. Recently, Balogh, Kostochka and Liu proved that $\u03c7$ $\u03c1$ is not bounded in the class of subcubic graphs [Packing chromatic number of subcubic graphs, Discrete Math. 341 (2018), 474483], thus answering a question previously addressed in several papers. However, several subclasses of cubic or subcubic graphs have bounded packing chromatic number. In this paper, we determine the exact value of, or upper and lower bounds on, the packing chromatic number of some classes of cubic graphs, namely circular ladders, and so-called H-graphs and generalised H-graphs.", "published": "2018-08-08 08:59:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02675v2", "categories": ["cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
