{"title": "Kaldi+PDNN: Building DNN-based ASR Systems with Kaldi and PDNN", "abstract": "The Kaldi toolkit is becoming popular for constructing automated speech\nrecognition (ASR) systems. Meanwhile, in recent years, deep neural networks\n(DNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance on various ASR tasks. This\ndocument describes our open-source recipes to implement fully-fledged DNN\nacoustic modeling using Kaldi and PDNN. PDNN is a lightweight deep learning\ntoolkit developed under the Theano environment. Using these recipes, we can\nbuild up multiple systems including DNN hybrid systems, convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) systems and bottleneck feature systems. These recipes are\ndirectly based on the Kaldi Switchboard 110-hour setup. However, adapting them\nto new datasets is easy to achieve.", "published": "2014-01-27 19:55:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6984v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
