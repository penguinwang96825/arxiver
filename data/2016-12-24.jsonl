{"title": "KS_JU@DPIL-FIRE2016:Detecting Paraphrases in Indian Languages Using\n  Multinomial Logistic Regression Model", "abstract": "In this work, we describe a system that detects paraphrases in Indian\nLanguages as part of our participation in the shared Task on detecting\nparaphrases in Indian Languages (DPIL) organized by Forum for Information\nRetrieval Evaluation (FIRE) in 2016. Our paraphrase detection method uses a\nmultinomial logistic regression model trained with a variety of features which\nare basically lexical and semantic level similarities between two sentences in\na pair. The performance of the system has been evaluated against the test set\nreleased for the FIRE 2016 shared task on DPIL. Our system achieves the highest\nf-measure of 0.95 on task1 in Punjabi language.The performance of our system on\ntask1 in Hindi language is f-measure of 0.90. Out of 11 teams participated in\nthe shared task, only four teams participated in all four languages, Hindi,\nPunjabi, Malayalam and Tamil, but the remaining 7 teams participated in one of\nthe four languages. We also participated in task1 and task2 both for all four\nIndian Languages. The overall average performance of our system including task1\nand task2 overall four languages is F1-score of 0.81 which is the second\nhighest score among the four systems that participated in all four languages.", "published": "2016-12-24 12:37:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08171v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Understanding Neural Networks through Representation Erasure", "abstract": "While neural networks have been successfully applied to many natural language\nprocessing tasks, they come at the cost of interpretability. In this paper, we\npropose a general methodology to analyze and interpret decisions from a neural\nmodel by observing the effects on the model of erasing various parts of the\nrepresentation, such as input word-vector dimensions, intermediate hidden\nunits, or input words. We present several approaches to analyzing the effects\nof such erasure, from computing the relative difference in evaluation metrics,\nto using reinforcement learning to erase the minimum set of input words in\norder to flip a neural model's decision. In a comprehensive analysis of\nmultiple NLP tasks, including linguistic feature classification, sentence-level\nsentiment analysis, and document level sentiment aspect prediction, we show\nthat the proposed methodology not only offers clear explanations about neural\nmodel decisions, but also provides a way to conduct error analysis on neural\nmodels.", "published": "2016-12-24 21:36:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08220v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "JU_KS_Group@FIRE 2016: Consumer Health Information Search", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the methodology used and the results obtained by\nus for completing the tasks given under the shared task on Consumer Health\nInformation Search (CHIS) collocated with the Forum for Information Retrieval\nEvaluation (FIRE) 2016, ISI Kolkata. The shared task consists of two sub-tasks\n- (1) task1: given a query and a document/set of documents associated with that\nquery, the task is to classify the sentences in the document as relevant to the\nquery or not and (2) task 2: the relevant sentences need to be further\nclassified as supporting the claim made in the query, or opposing the claim\nmade in the query. We have participated in both the sub-tasks. The percentage\naccuracy obtained by our developed system for task1 was 73.39 which is third\nhighest among the 9 teams participated in the shared task.", "published": "2016-12-24 13:30:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08178v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Predicting the Industry of Users on Social Media", "abstract": "Automatic profiling of social media users is an important task for supporting\na multitude of downstream applications. While a number of studies have used\nsocial media content to extract and study collective social attributes, there\nis a lack of substantial research that addresses the detection of a user's\nindustry. We frame this task as classification using both feature engineering\nand ensemble learning. Our industry-detection system uses both posted content\nand profile information to detect a user's industry with 64.3% accuracy,\nsignificantly outperforming the majority baseline in a taxonomy of fourteen\nindustry classes. Our qualitative analysis suggests that a person's industry\nnot only affects the words used and their perceived meanings, but also the\nnumber and type of emotions being expressed.", "published": "2016-12-24 17:09:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08205v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
