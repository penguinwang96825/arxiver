{"title": "Model Explanations under Calibration", "abstract": "Explaining and interpreting the decisions of recommender systems are becoming extremely relevant both, for improving predictive performance, and providing valid explanations to users. While most of the recent interest has focused on providing local explanations, there has been a much lower emphasis on studying the effects of model dynamics and its impact on explanation. In this paper, we perform a focused study on the impact of model interpretability in the context of calibration. Specifically, we address the challenges of both over-confident and under-confident predictions with interpretability using attention distribution. Our results indicate that the means of using attention distributions for interpretability are highly unstable for un-calibrated models. Our empirical analysis on the stability of attention distribution raises questions on the utility of attention for explainability.", "published": "2019-06-18 14:50:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07622v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
