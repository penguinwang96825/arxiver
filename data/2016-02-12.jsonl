{"title": "TabMCQ: A Dataset of General Knowledge Tables and Multiple-choice\n  Questions", "abstract": "We describe two new related resources that facilitate modelling of general\nknowledge reasoning in 4th grade science exams. The first is a collection of\ncurated facts in the form of tables, and the second is a large set of\ncrowd-sourced multiple-choice questions covering the facts in the tables.\nThrough the setup of the crowd-sourced annotation task we obtain implicit\nalignment information between questions and tables. We envisage that the\nresources will be useful not only to researchers working on question answering,\nbut also to people investigating a diverse range of other applications such as\ninformation extraction, question parsing, answer type identification, and\nlexical semantic modelling.", "published": "2016-02-12 03:54:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03960v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An Empirical Study on Academic Commentary and Its Implications on\n  Reading and Writing", "abstract": "The relationship between reading and writing (RRW) is one of the major themes\nin learning science. One of its obstacles is that it is difficult to define or\nmeasure the latent background knowledge of the individual. However, in an\nacademic research setting, scholars are required to explicitly list their\nbackground knowledge in the citation sections of their manuscripts. This unique\nopportunity was taken advantage of to observe RRW, especially in the published\nacademic commentary scenario. RRW was visualized under a proposed topic process\nmodel by using a state of the art version of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).\nThe empirical study showed that the academic commentary is modulated both by\nits target paper and the author's background knowledge. Although this\nconclusion was obtained in a unique environment, we suggest its implications\ncan also shed light on other similar interesting areas, such as dialog and\nconversation, group discussion, and social media.", "published": "2016-02-12 16:18:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04101v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Identifying Structures in Social Conversations in NSCLC Patients through\n  the Semi-Automatic extraction of Topical Taxonomies", "abstract": "The exploration of social conversations for addressing patient's needs is an\nimportant analytical task in which many scholarly publications are contributing\nto fill the knowledge gap in this area. The main difficulty remains the\ninability to turn such contributions into pragmatic processes the\npharmaceutical industry can leverage in order to generate insight from social\nmedia data, which can be considered as one of the most challenging source of\ninformation available today due to its sheer volume and noise. This study is\nbased on the work by Scott Spangler and Jeffrey Kreulen and applies it to\nidentify structure in social media through the extraction of a topical taxonomy\nable to capture the latent knowledge in social conversations in health-related\nsites. The mechanism for automatically identifying and generating a taxonomy\nfrom social conversations is developed and pressured tested using public data\nfrom media sites focused on the needs of cancer patients and their families.\nMoreover, a novel method for generating the category's label and the\ndetermination of an optimal number of categories is presented which extends\nScott and Jeffrey's research in a meaningful way. We assume the reader is\nfamiliar with taxonomies, what they are and how they are used.", "published": "2016-02-12 19:56:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04709v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "H.3.1; H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
