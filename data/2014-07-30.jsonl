{"title": "Two-pass Discourse Segmentation with Pairing and Global Features", "abstract": "Previous attempts at RST-style discourse segmentation typically adopt\nfeatures centered on a single token to predict whether to insert a boundary\nbefore that token. In contrast, we develop a discourse segmenter utilizing a\nset of pairing features, which are centered on a pair of adjacent tokens in the\nsentence, by equally taking into account the information from both tokens.\nMoreover, we propose a novel set of global features, which encode\ncharacteristics of the segmentation as a whole, once we have an initial\nsegmentation. We show that both the pairing and global features are useful on\ntheir own, and their combination achieved an $F_1$ of 92.6% of identifying\nin-sentence discourse boundaries, which is a 17.8% error-rate reduction over\nthe state-of-the-art performance, approaching 95% of human performance. In\naddition, similar improvement is observed across different classification\nframeworks.", "published": "2014-07-30 21:00:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8215v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
