{"title": "Mathematical Language Processing Project", "abstract": "In natural language, words and phrases themselves imply the semantics. In\ncontrast, the meaning of identifiers in mathematical formulae is undefined.\nThus scientists must study the context to decode the meaning. The Mathematical\nLanguage Processing (MLP) project aims to support that process. In this paper,\nwe compare two approaches to discover identifier-definition tuples. At first we\nuse a simple pattern matching approach. Second, we present the MLP approach\nthat uses part-of-speech tag based distances as well as sentence positions to\ncalculate identifier-definition probabilities. The evaluation of our\nprototypical system, applied on the Wikipedia text corpus, shows that our\napproach augments the user experience substantially. While hovering the\nidentifiers in the formula, tool-tips with the most probable definitions occur.\nTests with random samples show that the displayed definitions provide a good\nmatch with the actual meaning of the identifiers.", "published": "2014-07-01 09:56:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0167v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
