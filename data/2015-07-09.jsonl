{"title": "FAQ-based Question Answering via Word Alignment", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel word-alignment-based method to solve the\nFAQ-based question answering task. First, we employ a neural network model to\ncalculate question similarity, where the word alignment between two questions\nis used for extracting features. Second, we design a bootstrap-based feature\nextraction method to extract a small set of effective lexical features. Third,\nwe propose a learning-to-rank algorithm to train parameters more suitable for\nthe ranking tasks. Experimental results, conducted on three languages (English,\nSpanish and Japanese), demonstrate that the question similarity model is more\neffective than baseline systems, the sparse features bring 5% improvements on\ntop-1 accuracy, and the learning-to-rank algorithm works significantly better\nthan the traditional method. We further evaluate our method on the answer\nsentence selection task. Our method outperforms all the previous systems on the\nstandard TREC data set.", "published": "2015-07-09 18:11:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02628v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Data Mining of Causal Relations from Text: Analysing Maritime Accident\n  Investigation Reports", "abstract": "Text mining is a process of extracting information of interest from text.\nSuch a method includes techniques from various areas such as Information\nRetrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Information Extraction\n(IE). In this study, text mining methods are applied to extract causal\nrelations from maritime accident investigation reports collected from the\nMarine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). These causal relations provide\ninformation on various mechanisms behind accidents, including human and\norganizational factors relating to the accident. The objective of this study is\nto facilitate the analysis of the maritime accident investigation reports, by\nmeans of extracting contributory causes with more feasibility. A careful\ninvestigation of contributory causes from the reports provide opportunity to\nimprove safety in future.\n  Two methods have been employed in this study to extract the causal relations.\nThey are 1) Pattern classification method and 2) Connectives method. The\nearlier one uses naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as classifiers.\nThe latter simply searches for the words connecting cause and effect in\nsentences.\n  The causal patterns extracted using these two methods are compared to the\nmanual (human expert) extraction. The pattern classification method showed a\nfair and sensible performance with F-measure(average) = 65% when compared to\nconnectives method with F-measure(average) = 58%. This study is an evidence,\nthat text mining methods could be employed in extracting causal relations from\nmarine accident investigation reports.", "published": "2015-07-09 10:20:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02447v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
