{"title": "Effective Slot Filling Based on Shallow Distant Supervision Methods", "abstract": "Spoken Language Systems at Saarland University (LSV) participated this year\nwith 5 runs at the TAC KBP English slot filling track. Effective algorithms for\nall parts of the pipeline, from document retrieval to relation prediction and\nresponse post-processing, are bundled in a modular end-to-end relation\nextraction system called RelationFactory. The main run solely focuses on\nshallow techniques and achieved significant improvements over LSV's last year's\nsystem, while using the same training data and patterns. Improvements mainly\nhave been obtained by a feature representation focusing on surface skip n-grams\nand improved scoring for extracted distant supervision patterns. Important\nfactors for effective extraction are the training and tuning scheme for distant\nsupervision classifiers, and the query expansion by a translation model based\non Wikipedia links. In the TAC KBP 2013 English Slotfilling evaluation, the\nsubmitted main run of the LSV RelationFactory system achieved the top-ranked\nF1-score of 37.3%.", "published": "2014-01-06 18:03:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1158v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
