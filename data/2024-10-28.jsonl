{"title": "Modeling and Replication of the Prepayment Option of Mortgages including Behavioral Uncertainty", "abstract": "Prepayment risk embedded in fixed-rate mortgages forms a significant fraction\nof a financial institution's exposure, and it receives particular attention\nbecause of the magnitude of the underlying market. The embedded prepayment\noption (EPO) bears the same interest rate risk as an exotic interest rate swap\n(IRS) with a suitable stochastic notional. We investigate the effect of\nrelaxing the assumption of a deterministic relationship between the market\ninterest rate incentive and the prepayment rate. A non-hedgeable risk factor is\nmodeled to capture the uncertainty in mortgage owners' behavior, leading to an\nincomplete market. We prove under natural assumptions that including behavioral\nuncertainty reduces the exposure's value. We statically replicate the exposure\nresulting from the EPO with IRSs and swaptions, and we show that a replication\nbased on swaps solely cannot easily control the right tail of the exposure\ndistribution, while including swaptions enables that. The replication framework\nis flexible and focuses on different regions in the exposure distribution.\nSince a non-hedgeable risk factor entails the existence of multiple equivalent\nmartingale measures, pricing and optimal replication are not unique. We\ninvestigate the effect of a market price of risk misspecification and we\nprovide a methodology to generate robust hedging strategies. Such strategies,\nobtained as solutions to a saddle-point problem, allow us to bound the exposure\nagainst a misspecification of the pricing measure.", "published": "2024-10-28 15:12:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21110v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading", "abstract": "We develop a new framework to detect wash trading in crypto assets through\nreal-time liquidity fluctuation. We propose that short-term price jumps in\ncrypto assets results from wash trading-induced liquidity fluctuation, and\nconstruct two complementary liquidity measures, liquidity jump (size of\nfluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (volatility of fluctuation), to capture\nthe behavioral signature of wash trading. Using US stocks as a benchmark, we\ndemonstrate that joint elevation in both liquidity metrics indicates wash\ntrading in crypto assets. A simulated regulatory treatment that removes likely\nwash trades confirms this dynamic: it reduces liquidity diffusion significantly\nwhile leaving liquidity jump largely unaffected. These findings align with a\ntheoretical model in which manipulative traders amplify both the level and\nvariance of price pressure, whereas passive investors affect only the level.\nOur model offers practical tools for investors to assess market quality and for\nregulators to monitor manipulation risk on crypto exchanges without oversight.", "published": "2024-10-28 11:58:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803v4", "categories": ["q-fin.RM", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.RM"}
{"title": "Do LLM Personas Dream of Bull Markets? Comparing Human and AI Investment Strategies Through the Lens of the Five-Factor Model", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to adopt a\npersonality and behave in a human-like manner. There is a large body of\nresearch that investigates the behavioural impacts of personality in less\nobvious areas such as investment attitudes or creative decision making. In this\nstudy, we investigated whether an LLM persona with a specific Big Five\npersonality profile would perform an investment task similarly to a human with\nthe same personality traits. We used a simulated investment task to determine\nif these results could be generalised into actual behaviours. In this simulated\nenvironment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural\ndifferences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being\nconsistent with expectations derived from human research. We found that LLMs\nare able to generalise traits into expected behaviours in three areas: learning\nstyle, impulsivity and risk appetite while environmental attitudes could not be\naccurately represented. In addition, we showed that LLMs produce behaviour that\nis more reflective of human behaviour in a simulation environment compared to a\nsurvey environment.", "published": "2024-10-28 02:50:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05801v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.AI", "cs.CY", "q-fin.GN"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
