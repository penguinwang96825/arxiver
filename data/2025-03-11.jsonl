{"title": "Randomization in Optimal Execution Games", "abstract": "We study optimal execution in markets with transient price impact in a\ncompetitive setting with $N$ traders. Motivated by prior negative results on\nthe existence of pure Nash equilibria, we consider randomized strategies for\nthe traders and whether allowing such strategies can restore the existence of\nequilibria. We show that given a randomized strategy, there is a non-randomized\nstrategy with strictly lower expected execution cost, and moreover this\nde-randomization can be achieved by a simple averaging procedure. As a\nconsequence, Nash equilibria cannot contain randomized strategies, and\nnon-existence of pure equilibria implies non-existence of randomized\nequilibria. Separately, we also establish uniqueness of equilibria. Both\nresults hold in a general transaction cost model given by a strictly positive\ndefinite impact decay kernel and a convex trading cost.", "published": "2025-03-11 19:15:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08833v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.MF", "91A06, 91A15, 91G10"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}

{"title": "Existence of Optimal Contracts for Principal-Agent Problem with Drift Control and Quadratic Effort Cost", "abstract": "The existence of optimal contracts of the principal-agent problem is a\nlong-standing problem. According to the general framework in Cvitani\\'c et al.\n[2], this existence can be derived from the existence of a classical solution\nto a degenerated fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation\nproblem. In this work we consider the simple case with drift control and\nquadratic cost function, then prove the existence of classical solution to that\nPDE.", "published": "2025-03-11 14:55:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08503v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
{"title": "Liquidity Competition Between Brokers and an Informed Trader", "abstract": "We study a multi-agent setting in which brokers transact with an informed\ntrader. Through a sequential Stackelberg-type game, brokers manage trading\ncosts and adverse selection with an informed trader. In particular, supplying\nliquidity to the informed traders allows the brokers to speculate based on the\nflow information. They simultaneously attempt to minimize inventory risk and\ntrading costs with the lit market based on the informed order flow, also known\nas the internalization-externalization strategy. We solve in closed form for\nthe trading strategy that the informed trader uses with each broker and propose\na system of equations which classify the equilibrium strategies of the brokers.\nBy solving these equations numerically we may study the resulting strategies in\nequilibrium. Finally, we formulate a competitive game between brokers in order\nto determine the liquidity prices subject to precommitment supplied to the\ninformed trader and provide a numerical example in which the resulting\nequilibrium is not Pareto efficient.", "published": "2025-03-11 10:59:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08287v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
