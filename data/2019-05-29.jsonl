{"title": "Deep Cross Networks with Aesthetic Preference for Cross-domain Recommendation", "abstract": "When purchasing appearance-first products, e.g., clothes, product appearance aesthetics plays an important role in the decision process. Moreover, user's aesthetic preference, which can be regarded as a personality trait and a basic requirement, is domain independent and could be used as a bridge between domains for knowledge transfer. However, existing work has rarely considered the aesthetic information in product photos for cross-domain recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose a new deep Aesthetic preference Cross-Domain Network (ACDN), in which parameters characterizing personal aesthetic preferences are shared across networks to transfer knowledge between domains. Specifically, we first leverage an aesthetic network to extract relevant features. Then, we integrate the aesthetic features into a cross-domain network to transfer users' domain independent aesthetic preferences. Moreover, network cross-connections are introduced to enable dual knowledge transfer across domains. Finally, the experimental results on real-world data show that our proposed ACDN outperforms other benchmark methods in terms of recommendation accuracy. The results also show that users' aesthetic preferences are effective in alleviating the data sparsity issue on the cross-domain recommendation.", "published": "2019-05-29 07:54:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13030v1", "categories": ["cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Robo-Taxi service fleet sizing: assessing the impact of user trust and willingness-to-use", "abstract": "The first commercial fleets of Robo-Taxis will be on the road soon. Today important efforts are made to anticipate future Robo-Taxi services. Fleet size is one of the key parameters considered in the planning phase of service design and configuration. Based on multi-agent approaches, the fleet size can be explored using dynamic demand response simulations. Time and cost are the most common variables considered in such simulation approaches. However, personal taste variation can affect the demand and consequently the required fleet size. In this paper, we explore the impact of user trust and willingness-to-use on the Robo-Taxi fleet size. This research is based upon simulating the transportation system of the Rouen-Normandie metropolitan area in France using MATSim, a multi-agent activity-based simulator. A local survey is made in order to explore the variation of user trust and their willingness-to-use future Robo-Taxis according to the sociodemographic attributes. Integrating survey data in the model shows the significant importance of traveler trust and willingness-to-use varying the Robo-Taxi use and the required fleet size.", "published": "2019-05-29 08:22:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12267v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
