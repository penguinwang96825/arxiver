{"title": "On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs", "abstract": "We present an exact algorithm for computing all common subgraphs with the\nmaximum number of vertices across multiple graphs. Our approach is further\nextended to handle the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), identifying the\nlargest common subgraph in terms of either vertices or edges across multiple\ngraphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for\npossible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular\ngraphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified\nBron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate\nsolutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular\nproduct size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a\ngraph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize\nthe search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and\ncheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular\ngraphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our\napproach is scalable and fast.", "published": "2025-03-28 12:20:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368v2", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.DM", "math.CO", "q-bio.MN"], "primary_category": "cs.DS"}
{"title": "Valid Cuts for the Design of Potential-based Flow Networks", "abstract": "The construction of a cost minimal network for flows obeying physical laws is\nan important problem for the design of electricity, water, hydrogen, and\nnatural gas infrastructures. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer\nnon-linear program with potential-based flows. The non-convexity of the\nconstraints stemming from the potential-based flow model together with the\nbinary variables indicating the decision to build a connection make these\nprograms challenging to solve. We develop a novel class of valid inequalities\non the fractional relaxations of the binary variables. Further, we show that\nthis class of inequalities can be separated in polynomial time for solutions to\na fractional relaxation. This makes it possible to incorporate these\ninequalities into a branch-and-cut framework. The advantage of these\ninequalities is lastly demonstrated in a computational study on the design of\nreal-world gas transport networks.", "published": "2025-03-28 11:05:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22327v1", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.DM", "math.CO"], "primary_category": "math.OC"}
{"title": "Policy Optimization and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Mean-variance Team Stochastic Games", "abstract": "We study a long-run mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where each\nagent shares a common mean-variance objective for the system and takes actions\nindependently to maximize it. MV-TSG has two main challenges. First, the\nvariance metric is neither additive nor Markovian in a dynamic setting. Second,\nsimultaneous policy updates of all agents lead to a non-stationary environment\nfor each individual agent. Both challenges make dynamic programming\ninapplicable. In this paper, we study MV-TSGs from the perspective of\nsensitivity-based optimization. The performance difference and performance\nderivative formulas for joint policies are derived, which provide optimization\ninformation for MV-TSGs. We prove the existence of a deterministic Nash policy\nfor this problem. Subsequently, we propose a Mean-Variance Multi-Agent Policy\nIteration (MV-MAPI) algorithm with a sequential update scheme, where individual\nagent policies are updated one by one in a given order. We prove that the\nMV-MAPI algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective\nfunction. By analyzing the local geometry of stationary points, we derive\nspecific conditions for stationary points to be (local) Nash equilibria, and\nfurther, strict local optima. To solve large-scale MV-TSGs in scenarios with\nunknown environmental parameters, we extend the idea of trust region methods to\nMV-MAPI and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm named\nMean-Variance Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (MV-MATRPO). We\nderive a performance lower bound for each update of joint policies. Finally,\nnumerical experiments on energy management in multiple microgrid systems are\nconducted.", "published": "2025-03-28 16:21:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22779v1", "categories": ["cs.MA", "cs.GT", "cs.LG", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Cooperative Hybrid Multi-Agent Pathfinding Based on Shared Exploration Maps", "abstract": "Multi-Agent Pathfinding is used in areas including multi-robot formations,\nwarehouse logistics, and intelligent vehicles. However, many environments are\nincomplete or frequently change, making it difficult for standard centralized\nplanning or pure reinforcement learning to maintain both global solution\nquality and local flexibility.

We evaluate the framework in the discrete\nPOGEMA environment and compare it with baseline methods.

{"title": "An Advanced Ensemble Deep Learning Framework for Stock Price Prediction Using VAE, Transformer, and LSTM Model", "abstract": "This research proposes a cutting-edge ensemble deep learning framework for\nstock price prediction by combining three advanced neural network\narchitectures: The particular areas of interest for the research include but\nare not limited to: Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Transformer, and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The presented framework is aimed to\nsubstantially utilize the advantages of each model which would allow for\nachieving the identification of both linear and non-linear relations in stock\nprice movements. To improve the accuracy of its predictions it uses rich set of\ntechnical indicators and it scales its predictors based on the current market\nsituation. By trying out the framework on several stock data sets, and\nbenchmarking the results against single models and conventional forecasting,\nthe ensemble method exhibits consistently high accuracy and reliability. The\nVAE is able to learn linear representation on high-dimensional data while the\nTransformer outstandingly perform in recognizing long-term patterns on the\nstock price data. LSTM, based on its characteristics of being a model that can\ndeal with sequences, brings additional improvements to the given framework,\nespecially regarding temporal dynamics and fluctuations. Combined, these\ncomponents provide exceptional directional performance and a very small\ndisparity in the predicted results. The present solution has given a probable\nconcept that can handle the inherent problem of stock price prediction with\nhigh reliability and scalability. Compared to the performance of individual\nproposals based on the neural network, as well as classical methods, the\nproposed ensemble framework demonstrates the advantages of combining different\narchitectures. It has a very important application in algorithmic trading, risk\nanalysis, and control and decision-making for finance professions and scholars.", "published": "2025-03-28 07:20:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22192v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}

Our model is formulated as a\nleader-follower stochastic game, where the venue is the leader and a\nrepresentative LP is the follower. We derive approximate closed-form\nequilibrium solutions to the stochastic game and analyze the reward structure.\nOur findings suggest that under the equilibrium contract, LPs have incentives\nto add liquidity to the pool only when higher liquidity on average attracts\nmore noise trading.
