{"title": "Detecting (Un)Important Content for Single-Document News Summarization", "abstract": "We present a robust approach for detecting intrinsic sentence importance in\nnews, by training on two corpora of document-summary pairs. When used for\nsingle-document summarization, our approach, combined with the \"beginning of\ndocument\" heuristic, outperforms a state-of-the-art summarizer and the\nbeginning-of-article baseline in both automatic and manual evaluations. These\nresults represent an important advance because in the absence of cross-document\nrepetition, single document summarizers for news have not been able to\nconsistently outperform the strong beginning-of-article baseline.", "published": "2017-02-26 08:07:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07998v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Friends and Enemies of Clinton and Trump: Using Context for Detecting\n  Stance in Political Tweets", "abstract": "Stance detection, the task of identifying the speaker's opinion towards a\nparticular target, has attracted the attention of researchers. This paper\ndescribes a novel approach for detecting stance in Twitter. We define a set of\nfeatures in order to consider the context surrounding a target of interest with\nthe final aim of training a model for predicting the stance towards the\nmentioned targets. In particular, we are interested in investigating political\ndebates in social media. For this reason we evaluated our approach focusing on\ntwo targets of the SemEval-2016 Task6 on Detecting stance in tweets, which are\nrelated to the political campaign for the 2016 U.S. presidential elections:\nHillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump. For the sake of comparison with the state of\nthe art, we evaluated our model against the dataset released in the\nSemEval-2016 Task 6 shared task competition. Our results outperform the best\nones obtained by participating teams, and show that information about enemies\nand friends of politicians help in detecting stance towards them.", "published": "2017-02-26 11:22:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08021v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Despite the successes in capturing continuous distributions, the application\nof generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete settings, like natural\nlanguage tasks, is rather restricted. The fundamental reason is the difficulty\nof back-propagation through discrete random variables combined with the\ninherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems,\nwe propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial\nNetworks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel\nand low-variance objective using the discriminator's output that follows\ncorresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new\nobjective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The\nexperimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach.", "published": "2017-02-26 03:19:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07983v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
