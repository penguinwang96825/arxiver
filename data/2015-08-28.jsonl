{"title": "Understanding Editing Behaviors in Multilingual Wikipedia", "abstract": "Multilingualism is common offline, but we have a more limited understanding\nof the ways multilingualism is displayed online and the roles that\nmultilinguals play in the spread of content between speakers of different\nlanguages. We take a computational approach to studying multilingualism using\none of the largest user-generated content platforms, Wikipedia. We study\nmultilingualism by collecting and analyzing a large dataset of the content\nwritten by multilingual editors of the English, German, and Spanish editions of\nWikipedia. This dataset contains over two million paragraphs edited by over\n15,000 multilingual users from July 8 to August 9, 2013. We analyze these\nmultilingual editors in terms of their engagement, interests, and language\nproficiency in their primary and non-primary (secondary) languages and find\nthat the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the\nSpanish and German editions. Users primarily editing the Spanish and German\neditions make more complex edits than users who edit these editions as a second\nlanguage. In contrast, users editing the English edition as a second language\nmake edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit\nthe English edition. In this way, English serves a special role bringing\ntogether content written by multilinguals from many language editions.\nNonetheless, language remains a formidable hurdle to the spread of content: we\nfind evidence for a complexity barrier whereby editors are less likely to edit\ncomplex content in a second language. In addition, we find that multilinguals\nare less engaged and show lower levels of language proficiency in their second\nlanguages. We also examine the topical interests of multilingual editors and\nfind that there is no significant difference between primary and non-primary\neditors in each language.", "published": "2015-08-28 16:21:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07266v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
