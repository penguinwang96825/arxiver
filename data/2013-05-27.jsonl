{"title": "Fast and accurate sentiment classification using an enhanced Naive Bayes\n  model", "abstract": "We have explored different methods of improving the accuracy of a Naive Bayes\nclassifier for sentiment analysis. We observed that a combination of methods\nlike negation handling, word n-grams and feature selection by mutual\ninformation results in a significant improvement in accuracy. This implies that\na highly accurate and fast sentiment classifier can be built using a simple\nNaive Bayes model that has linear training and testing time complexities. We\nachieved an accuracy of 88.80% on the popular IMDB movie reviews dataset.", "published": "2013-05-27 08:37:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6143v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
