{"title": "Efficient Text Classification Using Tree-structured Multi-linear\n  Principal Component Analysis", "abstract": "A novel text data dimension reduction technique, called the tree-structured\nmulti-linear principal component anal- ysis (TMPCA), is proposed in this work.\nBeing different from traditional text dimension reduction methods that deal\nwith the word-level representation, the TMPCA technique reduces the dimension\nof input sequences and sentences to simplify the following text classification\ntasks. It is shown mathematically and experimentally that the TMPCA tool\ndemands much lower complexity (and, hence, less computing power) than the\nordinary principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, it is demon- strated\nby experimental results that the support vector machine (SVM) method applied to\nthe TMPCA-processed data achieves commensurable or better performance than the\nstate-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) approach.", "published": "2018-01-20 00:15:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06607v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Building an Ellipsis-aware Chinese Dependency Treebank for Web Text", "abstract": "Web 2.0 has brought with it numerous user-produced data revealing one's\nthoughts, experiences, and knowledge, which are a great source for many tasks,\nsuch as information extraction, and knowledge base construction. However, the\ncolloquial nature of the texts poses new challenges for current natural\nlanguage processing techniques, which are more adapt to the formal form of the\nlanguage. Ellipsis is a common linguistic phenomenon that some words are left\nout as they are understood from the context, especially in oral utterance,\nhindering the improvement of dependency parsing, which is of great importance\nfor tasks relied on the meaning of the sentence. In order to promote research\nin this area, we are releasing a Chinese dependency treebank of 319 weibos,\ncontaining 572 sentences with omissions restored and contexts reserved.", "published": "2018-01-20 01:59:21", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06613v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Chatbot (Short Version)", "abstract": "We present MILABOT: a deep reinforcement learning chatbot developed by the\nMontreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) for the Amazon Alexa Prize\ncompetition. MILABOT is capable of conversing with humans on popular small talk\ntopics through both speech and text. The system consists of an ensemble of\nnatural language generation and retrieval models, including neural network and\ntemplate-based models. By applying reinforcement learning to crowdsourced data\nand real-world user interactions, the system has been trained to select an\nappropriate response from the models in its ensemble. The system has been\nevaluated through A/B testing with real-world users, where it performed\nsignificantly better than other systems. The results highlight the potential of\ncoupling ensemble systems with deep reinforcement learning as a fruitful path\nfor developing real-world, open-domain conversational agents.", "published": "2018-01-20 17:22:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06700v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML", "I.5.1; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Gender-dependent emotion recognition based on HMMs and SPHMMs", "abstract": "It is well known that emotion recognition performance is not ideal. The work\nof this research is devoted to improving emotion recognition performance by\nemploying a two-stage recognizer that combines and integrates gender recognizer\nand emotion recognizer into one system. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and\nSuprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) have been used as classifiers in\nthe two-stage recognizer. This recognizer has been tested on two distinct and\nseparate emotional speech databases. The first database is our collected\ndatabase and the second one is the Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts\ndatabase. Six basic emotions including the neutral state have been used in each\ndatabase. Our results show that emotion recognition performance based on the\ntwo-stage approach (gender-dependent emotion recognizer) has been significantly\nimproved compared to that based on emotion recognizer without gender\ninformation and emotion recognizer with correct gender information by an\naverage of 11% and 5%, respectively. This work shows that the highest emotion\nidentification performance takes place when the classifiers are completely\nbiased towards suprasegmental models and no impact of acoustic models. The\nresults achieved based on the two-stage framework fall within 2.28% of those\nobtained in subjective assessment by human judges.", "published": "2018-01-20 11:05:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06657v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
