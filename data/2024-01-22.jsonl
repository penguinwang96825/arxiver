{"title": "A Simulation of Optimal Dryness When Moving in the Rain or Snow Using MATLAB", "abstract": "The classic question of whether one should walk or run in the rain to remain the least wet has inspired a myriad of solutions ranging from physically performing test runs in raining conditions to mathematically modeling human movement through rain. This manuscript approaches the classical problem by simulating movement through rainfall using MATLAB. Our simulation was generalizable to include snowfall as well. An increase in walking speed resulted in a corresponding decrease in raindrop and snowflake collisions. When raindrops or snowflakes were given a horizontal movement vector due to wind, a local minimum in collisions was achieved when moving in parallel with the same horizontal speed as the raindrop; no local minimum was detected with antiparallel movement. In general, our simulation revealed that the faster one moves, the drier one remains.", "published": "2024-01-22 15:10:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12023v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
