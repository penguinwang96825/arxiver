{"title": "Implementation of an Automatic Syllabic Division Algorithm from Speech\n  Files in Portuguese Language", "abstract": "A new algorithm for voice automatic syllabic splitting in the Portuguese\nlanguage is proposed, which is based on the envelope of the speech signal of\nthe input audio file. A computational implementation in MatlabTM is presented\nand made available at the URL\nhttp://www2.ee.ufpe.br/codec/divisao_silabica.html. Due to its\nstraightforwardness, the proposed method is very attractive for embedded\nsystems (e.g. i-phones). It can also be used as a screen to assist more\nsophisticated methods. Voice excerpts containing more than one syllable and\nidentified by the same envelope are named as super-syllables and they are\nsubsequently separated. The results indicate which samples corresponds to the\nbeginning and end of each detected syllable. Preliminary tests were performed\nto fifty words at an identification rate circa 70% (further improvements may be\nincorporated to treat particular phonemes). This algorithm is also useful in\nvoice command systems, as a tool in the teaching of Portuguese language or even\nfor patients with speech pathology.", "published": "2015-01-29 16:09:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07496v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL", "cs.DS", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
