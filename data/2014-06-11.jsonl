{"title": "A Brief State of the Art for Ontology Authoring", "abstract": "One of the main challenges for building the Semantic web is Ontology\nAuthoring. Controlled Natural Languages CNLs offer a user friendly means for\nnon-experts to author ontologies. This paper provides a snapshot of the\nstate-of-the-art for the core CNLs for ontology authoring and reviews their\nrespective evaluations.", "published": "2014-06-11 13:47:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2903v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "POS Tagging and its Applications for Mathematics", "abstract": "Content analysis of scientific publications is a nontrivial task, but a\nuseful and important one for scientific information services. In the Gutenberg\nera it was a domain of human experts; in the digital age many machine-based\nmethods, e.g., graph analysis tools and machine-learning techniques, have been\ndeveloped for it. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a powerful\nmachine-learning approach to semiautomatic speech and language processing,\nwhich is also applicable to mathematics. The well established methods of NLP\nhave to be adjusted for the special needs of mathematics, in particular for\nhandling mathematical formulae. We demonstrate a mathematics-aware part of\nspeech tagger and give a short overview about our adaptation of NLP methods for\nmathematical publications. We show the use of the tools developed for key\nphrase extraction and classification in the database zbMATH.", "published": "2014-06-11 12:25:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2880v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
{"title": "A machine-compiled macroevolutionary history of Phanerozoic life", "abstract": "Many aspects of macroevolutionary theory and our understanding of biotic\nresponses to global environmental change derive from literature-based\ncompilations of palaeontological data. Existing manually assembled databases\nare, however, incomplete and difficult to assess and enhance. Here, we develop\nand validate the quality of a machine reading system, PaleoDeepDive, that\nautomatically locates and extracts data from heterogeneous text, tables, and\nfigures in publications. PaleoDeepDive performs comparably to humans in complex\ndata extraction and inference tasks and generates congruent synthetic\nmacroevolutionary results. Unlike traditional databases, PaleoDeepDive produces\na probabilistic database that systematically improves as information is added.\nWe also show that the system can readily accommodate sophisticated data types,\nsuch as morphological data in biological illustrations and associated textual\ndescriptions. Our machine reading approach to scientific data integration and\nsynthesis brings within reach many questions that are currently underdetermined\nand does so in ways that may stimulate entirely new modes of inquiry.", "published": "2014-06-11 17:02:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2963v2", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "q-bio.PE"], "primary_category": "cs.DB"}
