{"title": "Good Debt or Bad Debt: Detecting Semantic Orientations in Economic Texts", "abstract": "The use of robo-readers to analyze news texts is an emerging technology trend\nin computational finance. In recent research, a substantial effort has been\ninvested to develop sophisticated financial polarity-lexicons that can be used\nto investigate how financial sentiments relate to future company performance.\nHowever, based on experience from other fields, where sentiment analysis is\ncommonly applied, it is well-known that the overall semantic orientation of a\nsentence may differ from the prior polarity of individual words. The objective\nof this article is to investigate how semantic orientations can be better\ndetected in financial and economic news by accommodating the overall\nphrase-structure information and domain-specific use of language. Our three\nmain contributions are: (1) establishment of a human-annotated finance\nphrase-bank, which can be used as benchmark for training and evaluating\nalternative models; (2) presentation of a technique to enhance financial\nlexicons with attributes that help to identify expected direction of events\nthat affect overall sentiment; (3) development of a linearized phrase-structure\nmodel for detecting contextual semantic orientations in financial and economic\nnews texts. The relevance of the newly added lexicon features and the benefit\nof using the proposed learning-algorithm are demonstrated in a comparative\nstudy against previously used general sentiment models as well as the popular\nword frequency models used in recent financial studies. The proposed framework\nis parsimonious and avoids the explosion in feature-space caused by the use of\nconventional n-gram features.", "published": "2013-07-19 20:49:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5336v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "q-fin.CP", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Speaker Independent Continuous Speech to Text Converter for Mobile\n  Application", "abstract": "An efficient speech to text converter for mobile application is presented in\nthis work. The prime motive is to formulate a system which would give optimum\nperformance in terms of complexity, accuracy, delay and memory requirements for\nmobile environment. The speech to text converter consists of two stages namely\nfront-end analysis and pattern recognition. The front end analysis involves\npreprocessing and feature extraction. The traditional voice activity detection\nalgorithms which track only energy cannot successfully identify potential\nspeech from input because the unwanted part of the speech also has some energy\nand appears to be speech. In the proposed system, VAD that calculates energy of\nhigh frequency part separately as zero crossing rate to differentiate noise\nfrom speech is used. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) is used as\nfeature extraction method and Generalized Regression Neural Network is used as\nrecognizer. MFCC provides low word error rate and better feature extraction.\nNeural Network improves the accuracy. Thus a small database containing all\npossible syllable pronunciation of the user is sufficient to give recognition\naccuracy closer to 100%. Thus the proposed technique entertains realization of\nreal time speaker independent applications like mobile phones, PDAs etc.", "published": "2013-07-19 05:27:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5736v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
