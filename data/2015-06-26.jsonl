{"title": "Automagically encoding Adverse Drug Reactions in MedDRA", "abstract": "Pharmacovigilance is the field of science devoted to the collection, analysis\nand prevention of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). Efficient strategies for the\nextraction of information about ADRs from free text resources are essential to\nsupport the work of experts, employed in the crucial task of detecting and\nclassifying unexpected pathologies possibly related to drug assumptions.\nNarrative ADR descriptions may be collected in several way, e.g. by monitoring\nsocial networks or through the so called spontaneous reporting, the main method\npharmacovigilance adopts in order to identify ADRs. The encoding of free-text\nADR descriptions according to MedDRA standard terminology is central for report\nanalysis. It is a complex work, which has to be manually implemented by the\npharmacovigilance experts. The manual encoding is expensive (in terms of time).\nMoreover, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur, since the\nnumber of reports is growing up day by day. In this paper, we propose\nMagiCoder, an efficient Natural Language Processing algorithm able to\nautomatically derive MedDRA terminologies from free-text ADR descriptions.\nMagiCoder is part of VigiWork, a web application for online ADR reporting and\nanalysis. From a practical view-point, MagiCoder radically reduces the revision\ntime of ADR reports: the pharmacologist has simply to revise and validate the\nautomatic solution versus the hard task of choosing solutions in the 70k terms\nof MedDRA. This improvement of the expert work efficiency has a meaningful\nimpact on the quality of data analysis. Moreover, our procedure is general\npurpose. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language, but\npreliminarily analyses show that it is robust to language and dictionary\nchanges.", "published": "2015-06-26 13:17:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08052v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

More than 5,000\nreaders submit captions for it. The editors select three of them and ask the\nreaders to pick the funniest one. We describe an experiment that compares a\ndozen automatic methods for selecting the funniest caption. We show that\nnegative sentiment, human-centeredness, and lexical centrality most strongly\nmatch the funniest captions, followed by positive sentiment. These results are\nuseful for understanding humor and also in the design of more engaging\nconversational agents in text and multimodal (vision+text) systems.
