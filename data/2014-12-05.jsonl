{"title": "On Using Very Large Target Vocabulary for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Neural machine translation, a recently proposed approach to machine\ntranslation based purely on neural networks, has shown promising results\ncompared to the existing approaches such as phrase-based statistical machine\ntranslation. Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its\nlimitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as\ndecoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In\nthis paper, we propose a method that allows us to use a very large target\nvocabulary without increasing training complexity, based on importance\nsampling. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model\nhaving a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the\nwhole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are\nempirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as\nwell as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we\nuse the ensemble of a few models with very large target vocabularies, we\nachieve the state-of-the-art translation performance (measured by BLEU) on the\nEnglish->German translation and almost as high performance as state-of-the-art\nEnglish->French translation system.", "published": "2014-12-05 14:26:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2007v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Integer-Programming Ensemble of Temporal-Relations Classifiers", "abstract": "The extraction and understanding of temporal events and their relations are\nmajor challenges in natural language processing. Processing text on a\nsentence-by-sentence or expression-by-expression basis often fails, in part due\nto the challenge of capturing the global consistency of the text. We present an\nensemble method, which reconciles the outputs of multiple classifiers of\ntemporal expressions across the text using integer programming. Computational\nexperiments show that the ensemble improves upon the best individual results\nfrom two recent challenges, SemEval-2013 TempEval-3 (Temporal Annotation) and\nSemEval-2016 Task 12 (Clinical TempEval).", "published": "2014-12-05 00:30:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1866v4", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "math.OC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
