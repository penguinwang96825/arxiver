The emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) offers a chance to\ntransform wildlife monitoring by enabling efficient, real-time da-ta analysis\ndirectly on edge devices. Addressing the challenge of wildlife conservation,\nthis research paper explores the pivotal role of machine learn-ing,\nspecifically TinyML, in the classification and monitoring of hornbill calls in\nMalaysia. Leveraging audio data from the Xeno-canto database, the study aims to\ndevelop a speech recognition system capable of identifying and classifying\nhornbill vocalizations.

{"title": "EvMic: Event-based Non-contact sound recovery from effective spatial-temporal modeling", "abstract": "When sound waves hit an object, they induce vibrations that produce\nhigh-frequency and subtle visual changes, which can be used for recovering the\nsound. Early studies always encounter trade-offs related to sampling rate,\nbandwidth, field of view, and the simplicity of the optical path. Recent\nadvances in event camera hardware show good potential for its application in\nvisual sound recovery, because of its superior ability in capturing\nhigh-frequency signals. However, existing event-based vibration recovery\nmethods are still sub-optimal for sound recovery. In this work, we propose a\nnovel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery, fully utilizing spatial-temporal\ninformation from the event stream. We first generate a large training set using\na novel simulation pipeline. Then we designed a network that leverages the\nsparsity of events to capture spatial information and uses Mamba to model\nlong-term temporal information. Lastly, we train a spatial aggregation block to\naggregate information from different locations to further improve signal\nquality. To capture event signals caused by sound waves, we also designed an\nimaging system using a laser matrix to enhance the gradient and collected\nmultiple data sequences for testing.

{"title": "Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models", "abstract": "Existing Speech Language Model (SLM) scaling analysis paints a bleak picture.\nThey predict that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text,\nleading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs.\nHowever, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using\nspeech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question\n- Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs? In this paper\nwe answer a resounding, yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by\ntraining several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this\nsetup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results\nindicate that the scaling-dynamics are significantly different than\ntextless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute\nbudget for increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role\nof synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential.\nResults suggest, that our scaled up model achieves comparable performance with\nleading models on speech semantic metrics while using less compute and data\nthan other approaches.

{"title": "Causal Self-supervised Pretrained Frontend with Predictive Code for Speech Separation", "abstract": "Speech separation (SS) seeks to disentangle a multi-talker speech mixture\ninto single-talker speech streams. Although SS can be generally achieved using\noffline methods, such a processing paradigm is not suitable for real-time\nstreaming applications. Causal separation models, which rely only on past and\npresent information, offer a promising solution for real-time streaming.\nHowever, these models typically suffer from notable performance degradation due\nto the absence of future context. In this paper, we introduce a novel frontend\nthat is designed to mitigate the mismatch between training and run-time\ninference by implicitly incorporating future information into causal models\nthrough predictive patterns. The pretrained frontend employs a transformer\ndecoder network with a causal convolutional encoder as the backbone and is\npretrained in a self-supervised manner with two innovative pretext tasks:\nautoregressive hybrid prediction and contextual knowledge distillation. These\ntasks enable the model to capture predictive patterns directly from mixtures in\na self-supervised manner. The pretrained frontend subsequently serves as a\nfeature extractor to generate high-quality predictive patterns.
