{"title": "Semantically-Informed Syntactic Machine Translation: A Tree-Grafting\n  Approach", "abstract": "We describe a unified and coherent syntactic framework for supporting a\nsemantically-informed syntactic approach to statistical machine translation.\nSemantically enriched syntactic tags assigned to the target-language training\ntexts improved translation quality. The resulting system significantly\noutperformed a linguistically naive baseline model (Hiero), and reached the\nhighest scores yet reported on the NIST 2009 Urdu-English translation task.\nThis finding supports the hypothesis (posed by many researchers in the MT\ncommunity, e.g., in DARPA GALE) that both syntactic and semantic information\nare critical for improving translation quality---and further demonstrates that\nlarge gains can be achieved for low-resource languages with different word\norder than English.", "published": "2014-09-24 20:16:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7085v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "stat.ML", "I.2.7; I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
