{"title": "Assessing the Quality of MT Systems for Hindi to English Translation", "abstract": "Evaluation plays a vital role in checking the quality of MT output. It is\ndone either manually or automatically. Manual evaluation is very time consuming\nand subjective, hence use of automatic metrics is done most of the times. This\npaper evaluates the translation quality of different MT Engines for\nHindi-English (Hindi data is provided as input and English is obtained as\noutput) using various automatic metrics like BLEU, METEOR etc. Further the\ncomparison automatic evaluation results with Human ranking have also been\ngiven.", "published": "2014-04-15 17:13:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3992v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Is it morally acceptable for a system to lie to persuade me?", "abstract": "Given the fast rise of increasingly autonomous artificial agents and robots,\na key acceptability criterion will be the possible moral implications of their\nactions. In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to\ninfluence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because\nof their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are\nrare and tend to focus on the output of the required action. Instead, this work\nfocuses on the persuasive acts themselves (e.g. \"is it morally acceptable that\na machine lies or appeals to the emotions of a person to persuade her, even if\nfor a good end?\"). Exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment\nof moral dilemmas -- i.e. without any prior assumption of underlying ethical\ntheories -- this paper reports on a set of experiments. These experiments\naddress the type of persuader (human or machine), the strategies adopted\n(purely argumentative, appeal to positive emotions, appeal to negative\nemotions, lie) and the circumstances. Findings display no differences due to\nthe agent, mild acceptability for persuasion and reveal that truth-conditional\nreasoning (i.e. argument validity) is a significant dimension affecting\nsubjects' judgment. Some implications for the design of intelligent persuasive\nsystems are discussed.", "published": "2014-04-15 15:41:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3959v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
