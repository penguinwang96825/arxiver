{"title": "Semi-Supervised Instance Population of an Ontology using Word Vector\n  Embeddings", "abstract": "In many modern day systems such as information extraction and knowledge\nmanagement agents, ontologies play a vital role in maintaining the concept\nhierarchies of the selected domain. However, ontology population has become a\nproblematic process due to its nature of heavy coupling with manual human\nintervention. With the use of word embeddings in the field of natural language\nprocessing, it became a popular topic due to its ability to cope up with\nsemantic sensitivity. Hence, in this study, we propose a novel way of\nsemi-supervised ontology population through word embeddings as the basis. We\nbuilt several models including traditional benchmark models and new types of\nmodels which are based on word embeddings. Finally, we ensemble them together\nto come up with a synergistic model with better accuracy. We demonstrate that\nour ensemble model can outperform the individual models.", "published": "2017-09-09 05:04:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02911v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Steering Output Style and Topic in Neural Response Generation", "abstract": "We propose simple and flexible training and decoding methods for influencing\noutput style and topic in neural encoder-decoder based language generation.\nThis capability is desirable in a variety of applications, including\nconversational systems, where successful agents need to produce language in a\nspecific style and generate responses steered by a human puppeteer or external\nknowledge. We decompose the neural generation process into empirically easier\nsub-problems: a faithfulness model and a decoding method based on\nselective-sampling. We also describe training and sampling algorithms that bias\nthe generation process with a specific language style restriction, or a topic\nrestriction. Human evaluation results show that our proposed methods are able\nto restrict style and topic without degrading output quality in conversational\ntasks.", "published": "2017-09-09 22:03:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03010v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Sentiment Polarity Detection for Software Development", "abstract": "The role of sentiment analysis is increasingly emerging to study software\ndevelopers' emotions by mining crowd-generated content within social software\nengineering tools. However, off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools have been\ntrained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus\nresulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports. Here,\nwe present Senti4SD, a classifier specifically trained to support sentiment\nanalysis in developers' communication channels. Senti4SD is trained and\nvalidated using a gold standard of Stack Overflow questions, answers, and\ncomments manually annotated for sentiment polarity. It exploits a suite of both\nlexicon- and keyword-based features, as well as semantic features based on word\nembedding. With respect to a mainstream off-the-shelf tool, which we use as a\nbaseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts\nas emotionally negative. To encourage replications, we release a lab package\nincluding the classifier, the word embedding space, and the gold standard with\nannotation guidelines.", "published": "2017-09-09 17:28:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02984v2", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
