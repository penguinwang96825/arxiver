{"title": "A Case Study in Text Mining: Interpreting Twitter Data From World Cup\n  Tweets", "abstract": "Cluster analysis is a field of data analysis that extracts underlying\npatterns in data. One application of cluster analysis is in text-mining, the\nanalysis of large collections of text to find similarities between documents.\nWe used a collection of about 30,000 tweets extracted from Twitter just before\nthe World Cup started. A common problem with real world text data is the\npresence of linguistic noise. In our case it would be extraneous tweets that\nare unrelated to dominant themes. To combat this problem, we created an\nalgorithm that combined the DBSCAN algorithm and a consensus matrix. This way\nwe are left with the tweets that are related to those dominant themes. We then\nused cluster analysis to find those topics that the tweets describe. We\nclustered the tweets using k-means, a commonly used clustering algorithm, and\nNon-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and compared the results. The two\nalgorithms gave similar results, but NMF proved to be faster and provided more\neasily interpreted results. We explored our results using two visualization\ntools, Gephi and Wordle.", "published": "2014-08-21 17:58:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5427v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "I.5.4; I.2.7; H.2.8; H.3.3"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
