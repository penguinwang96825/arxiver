{"title": "Quantum Entanglement in Concept Combinations", "abstract": "Research in the application of quantum structures to cognitive science\nconfirms that these structures quite systematically appear in the dynamics of\nconcepts and their combinations and quantum-based models faithfully represent\nexperimental data of situations where classical approaches are problematical.\nIn this paper, we analyze the data we collected in an experiment on a specific\nconceptual combination, showing that Bell's inequalities are violated in the\nexperiment. We present a new refined entanglement scheme to model these data\nwithin standard quantum theory rules, where 'entangled measurements and\nentangled evolutions' occur, in addition to the expected 'entangled states',\nand present a full quantum representation in complex Hilbert space of the data.\nThis stronger form of entanglement in measurements and evolutions might have\nrelevant applications in the foundations of quantum theory, as well as in the\ninterpretation of nonlocality tests. It could indeed explain some\nnon-negligible 'anomalies' identified in EPR-Bell experiments.", "published": "2013-02-15 18:20:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3831v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "quant-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Identifying trends in word frequency dynamics", "abstract": "The word-stock of a language is a complex dynamical system in which words can\nbe created, evolve, and become extinct. Even more dynamic are the short-term\nfluctuations in word usage by individuals in a population. Building on the\nrecent demonstration that word niche is a strong determinant of future rise or\nfall in word frequency, here we introduce a model that allows us to distinguish\npersistent from temporary increases in frequency. Our model is illustrated\nusing a 10^8-word database from an online discussion group and a 10^11-word\ncollection of digitized books. The model reveals a strong relation between\nchanges in word dissemination and changes in frequency. Aside from their\nimplications for short-term word frequency dynamics, these observations are\npotentially important for language evolution as new words must survive in the\nshort term in order to survive in the long term.", "published": "2013-02-15 21:22:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3892v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cs.CL", "q-bio.PE"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
