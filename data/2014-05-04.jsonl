{"title": "\"Translation can't change a name\": Using Multilingual Data for Named\n  Entity Recognition", "abstract": "Named Entities (NEs) are often written with no orthographic changes across\ndifferent languages that share a common alphabet. We show that this can be\nleveraged so as to improve named entity recognition (NER) by using unsupervised\nword clusters from secondary languages as features in state-of-the-art\ndiscriminative NER systems. We observe significant increases in performance,\nfinding that person and location identification is particularly improved, and\nthat phylogenetically close languages provide more valuable features than more\ndistant languages.", "published": "2014-05-04 14:23:53", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0701v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
