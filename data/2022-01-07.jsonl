{"title": "Optimizing the Communication-Accuracy Trade-off in Federated Learning with Rate-Distortion Theory", "abstract": "A significant bottleneck in federated learning (FL) is the network communication cost of sending model updates from client devices to the central server. We present a comprehensive empirical study of the statistics of model updates in FL, as well as the role and benefits of various compression techniques. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel method to reduce the average communication cost, which is near-optimal in many use cases, and outperforms Top-K, DRIVE, 3LC and QSGD on Stack Overflow next-word prediction, a realistic and challenging FL benchmark. This is achieved by examining the problem using rate-distortion theory, and proposing distortion as a reliable proxy for model accuracy. Distortion can be more effectively used for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and communication cost across clients. We demonstrate empirically that in spite of the non-i.i.d. nature of federated learning, the rate-distortion frontier is consistent across datasets, optimizers, clients and training rounds.", "published": "2022-01-07 20:17:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02664v3", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DC", "cs.IT", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Applications of Signature Methods to Market Anomaly Detection", "abstract": "Anomaly detection is the process of identifying abnormal instances or events in data sets which deviate from the norm significantly. In this study, we propose a signatures based machine learning algorithm to detect rare or unexpected items in a given data set of time series type. We present applications of signature or randomized signature as feature extractors for anomaly detection algorithms; additionally we provide an easy, representation theoretic justification for the construction of randomized signatures. Our first application is based on synthetic data and aims at distinguishing between real and fake trajectories of stock prices, which are indistinguishable by visual inspection. We also show a real life application by using transaction data from the cryptocurrency market. In this case, we are able to identify pump and dump attempts organized on social networks with F1 scores up to 88% by means of our unsupervised learning algorithm, thus achieving results that are close to the state-of-the-art in the field based on supervised learning.", "published": "2022-01-07 13:05:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02441v2", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.LG", "q-fin.MF", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
