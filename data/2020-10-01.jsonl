{"title": "Referring Image Segmentation via Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension", "abstract": "Referring image segmentation aims at segmenting the foreground masks of the entities that can well match the description given in the natural language expression. Previous approaches tackle this problem using implicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic modalities, but usually fail to explore informative words of the expression to well align features from the two modalities for accurately identifying the referred entity. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension (CMPC) module and a Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to effectively address the challenging task. Concretely, the CMPC module first employs entity and attribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered by the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the correct entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by multimodal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC module, we further leverage a simple yet effective TGFE module to integrate the reasoned multimodal features from different levels with the guidance of textual information. In this way, features from multi-levels could communicate with each other and be refined based on the textual context. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular referring segmentation benchmarks and achieve new state-of-the-art performances.", "published": "2020-10-01 16:02:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00514v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Evaluating a Generative Adversarial Framework for Information Retrieval", "abstract": "Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have resulted in its widespread applications to multiple domains. A recent model, IRGAN, applies this framework to Information Retrieval (IR) and has gained significant attention over the last few years. In this focused work, we critically analyze multiple components of IRGAN, while providing experimental and theoretical evidence of some of its shortcomings. Specifically, we identify issues with the constant baseline term in the policy gradients optimization and show that the generator harms IRGAN's performance. Motivated by our findings, we propose two models influenced by self-contrastive estimation and co-training which outperform IRGAN on two out of the three tasks considered.", "published": "2020-10-01 23:11:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00722v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Deep Group-wise Variational Diffeomorphic Image Registration", "abstract": "Deep neural networks are increasingly used for pair-wise image registration. We propose to extend current learning-based image registration to allow simultaneous registration of multiple images. To achieve this, we build upon the pair-wise variational and diffeomorphic VoxelMorph approach and present a general mathematical framework that enables both registration of multiple images to their geodesic average and registration in which any of the available images can be used as a fixed image. In addition, we provide a likelihood based on normalized mutual information, a well-known image similarity metric in registration, between multiple images, and a prior that allows for explicit control over the viscous fluid energy to effectively regularize deformations. We trained and evaluated our approach using intra-patient registration of breast MRI and Thoracic 4DCT exams acquired over multiple time points. Comparison with Elastix and VoxelMorph demonstrates competitive quantitative performance of the proposed method in terms of image similarity and reference landmark distances at significantly faster registration.", "published": "2020-10-01 07:37:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00231v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "eess.IV"}
{"title": "Why Adversarial Interaction Creates Non-Homogeneous Patterns: A Pseudo-Reaction-Diffusion Model for Turing Instability", "abstract": "Long after Turing's seminal Reaction-Diffusion (RD) model, the elegance of his fundamental equations alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding pattern formation. Though Turing model is a simplification and an idealization, it is one of the best-known theoretical models to explain patterns as a reminiscent of those observed in nature. Over the years, concerted efforts have been made to align theoretical models to explain patterns in real systems. The apparent difficulty in identifying the specific dynamics of the RD system makes the problem particularly challenging. Interestingly, we observe Turing-like patterns in a system of neurons with adversarial interaction. In this study, we establish the involvement of Turing instability to create such patterns. By theoretical and empirical studies, we present a pseudo-reaction-diffusion model to explain the mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. While supervised learning attains homogeneous equilibrium, this paper suggests that the introduction of an adversary helps break this homogeneity to create non-homogeneous patterns at equilibrium. Further, we prove that randomly initialized gradient descent with over-parameterization can converge exponentially fast to an $\u03b5$-stationary point even under adversarial interaction. In addition, different from sole supervision, we show that the solutions obtained under adversarial interaction are not limited to a tiny subspace around initialization.", "published": "2020-10-01 16:09:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00521v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "PHASED: Phase-Aware Submodularity-Based Energy Disaggregation", "abstract": "Energy disaggregation is the task of discerning the energy consumption of individual appliances from aggregated measurements, which holds promise for understanding and reducing energy usage. In this paper, we propose PHASED, an optimization approach for energy disaggregation that has two key features: PHASED (i) exploits the structure of power distribution systems to make use of readily available measurements that are neglected by existing methods, and (ii) poses the problem as a minimization of a difference of submodular functions. We leverage this form by applying a discrete optimization variant of the majorization-minimization algorithm to iteratively minimize a sequence of global upper bounds of the cost function to obtain high-quality approximate solutions. PHASED improves the disaggregation accuracy of state-of-the-art models by up to 61% and achieves better prediction on heavy load appliances.", "published": "2020-10-01 21:47:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00696v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
