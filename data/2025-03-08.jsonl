{"title": "Entropy-Assisted Quality Pattern Identification in Finance", "abstract": "Short-term patterns in financial time series form the cornerstone of many\nalgorithmic trading strategies, yet extracting these patterns reliably from\nnoisy market data remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose an\nentropy-assisted framework for identifying high-quality, non-overlapping\npatterns that exhibit consistent behavior over time. We ground our approach in\nthe premise that historical patterns, when accurately clustered and pruned, can\nyield substantial predictive power for short-term price movements. To achieve\nthis, we incorporate an entropy-based measure as a proxy for information gain.\nPatterns that lead to high one-sided movements in historical data, yet retain\nlow local entropy, are more informative in signaling future market direction.\nCompared to conventional clustering techniques such as K-means and Gaussian\nMixture Models (GMM), which often yield biased or unbalanced groupings, our\napproach emphasizes balance over a forced visual boundary, ensuring that\nquality patterns are not lost due to over-segmentation. By emphasizing both\npredictive purity (low local entropy) and historical profitability, our method\nachieves a balanced representation of Buy and Sell patterns, making it better\nsuited for short-term algorithmic trading strategies.", "published": "2025-03-08 15:19:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06251v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
