{"title": "Boost Phrase-level Polarity Labelling with Review-level Sentiment\n  Classification", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis on user reviews helps to keep track of user reactions\ntowards products, and make advices to users about what to buy. State-of-the-art\nreview-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good\nprecisions of above 90%. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis\napproaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around\n70%~80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many\npractical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level\nsentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level\nand review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between\nthe numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user\nreviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a\nbasic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not\nnecessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level\nsentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity\nlabelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the\nframework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and\nheuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity.\nExperimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our\nframework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a\nsignificant improvement from current approaches.", "published": "2015-02-11 14:45:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03322v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
