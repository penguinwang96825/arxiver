{"title": "On the positivity of local mild solutions to stochastic evolution equations", "abstract": "We provide sufficient conditions on the coefficients of a stochastic evolution equation on a Hilbert space of functions driven by a cylindrical Wiener process ensuring that its mild solution is positive if the initial datum is positive. As an application, we discuss the positivity of forward rates in the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model via Musiela's stochastic PDE.", "published": "2019-12-31 10:34:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13259v1", "categories": ["math.AP", "math.PR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.AP"}
