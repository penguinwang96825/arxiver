{"title": "Online Learning for Effort Reduction in Interactive Neural Machine\n  Translation", "abstract": "Neural machine translation systems require large amounts of training data and\nresources. Even with this, the quality of the translations may be insufficient\nfor some users or domains. In such cases, the output of the system must be\nrevised by a human agent. This can be done in a post-editing stage or following\nan interactive machine translation protocol.\n  We explore the incremental update of neural machine translation systems\nduring the post-editing or interactive translation processes. Such\nmodifications aim to incorporate the new knowledge, from the edited sentences,\ninto the translation system. Updates to the model are performed on-the-fly, as\nsentences are corrected, via online learning techniques. In addition, we\nimplement a novel interactive, adaptive system, able to react to\nsingle-character interactions. This system greatly reduces the human effort\nrequired for obtaining high-quality translations.\n  In order to stress our proposals, we conduct exhaustive experiments varying\nthe amount and type of data available for training. Results show that online\nlearning effectively achieves the objective of reducing the human effort\nrequired during the post-editing or the interactive machine translation stages.\nMoreover, these adaptive systems also perform well in scenarios with scarce\nresources. We show that a neural machine translation system can be rapidly\nadapted to a specific domain, exclusively by means of online learning\ntechniques.", "published": "2018-02-10 14:07:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03594v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "TextZoo, a New Benchmark for Reconsidering Text Classification", "abstract": "Text representation is a fundamental concern in Natural Language Processing,\nespecially in text classification. Recently, many neural network approaches\nwith delicate representation model (e.g. FASTTEXT, CNN, RNN and many hybrid\nmodels with attention mechanisms) claimed that they achieved state-of-art in\nspecific text classification datasets. However, it lacks an unified benchmark\nto compare these models and reveals the advantage of each sub-components for\nvarious settings. We re-implement more than 20 popular text representation\nmodels for classification in more than 10 datasets. In this paper, we\nreconsider the text classification task in the perspective of neural network\nand get serval effects with analysis of the above results.", "published": "2018-02-10 22:34:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03656v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

If same or\nsimilar trademark is registered for the same or similar commodity, the\npurchaser of the goods may be confused. Therefore, in the process of trademark\nregistration examination, the examiner judges whether the trademark is the same\nor similar to the other applied or registered trademarks. The confusion in\ntrademarks is based on the visual, phonetic or conceptual similarity of the\nmarks. In this paper, we focus specifically on the phonetic similarity between\ntrademarks. We propose a method to generate 2D phonetic feature for\nconvolutional neural network in assessment of trademark similarity. This\nproposed algorithm is tested with 12,553 trademark phonetic similar pairs and\n34,020 trademark phonetic non-similar pairs from 2010 to 2016. As a result, we\nhave obtained approximately 92% judgment accuracy.", "published": "2018-02-10 12:50:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03581v1", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CV", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
