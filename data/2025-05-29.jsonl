{"title": "Are Reasoning Models More Prone to Hallucination?", "abstract": "Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in\nsolving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As\nthese LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,\nwhether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination\nin fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1\nreports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while\nOpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally\nraises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to\nhallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)\nWe first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our\nanalysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold\nstart supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate\ntheir hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training\nwithout cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To\nexplore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on\nhallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two\ncritical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw\nRepetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the\nsame underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer\nfails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate\nthe mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model\nuncertainty.

This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs\non neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the\ninclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted\nusing 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery\nboard examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study\nintroduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The\nframework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing\npolysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to\ndetermine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on\nstandard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing\noutcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing\nthreshold.

Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration.

MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the\noutput with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.\nAlthough MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of\nsentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text\ngeneration tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for\nevaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant\nof MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document\nusing a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the\nperformance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level\nmachine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks.

Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial\npolicy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we\npropose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by\nprovably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences\nand reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a\nnonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To\novercome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \\log n)$\nalgorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by\nexplicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set.

{"title": "D-AR: Diffusion via Autoregressive Models", "abstract": "This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new\nparadigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive\nprocedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing\nthe tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where\ntokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising\nsteps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens\nnaturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to\nautoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on\nthese tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or\ntraining/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token\ngeneration directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,\nonce the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly\ndecode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the\nstreaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,\nfor example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of\ntokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis.

{"title": "Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for computing the N-point Discrete\nFourier Transform (DFT) based solely on recursive Rectangular Index Compression\n(RIC) [1][2] and structured frequency shifts. The RIC DFT algorithm compresses\na signal from $N=CL$ to $C\\in[2,N/2]$ points at the expense of $N-1$ complex\nadditions and no complex multiplication. It is shown that a $C$-point DFT on\nthe compressed signal corresponds exactly to $C$ DFT coefficients of the\noriginal $N$-point DFT, namely, $X_{kL}$, $k=0,1,\\ldots,C-1$ with no need for\ntwiddle factors. We rely on this strategy to decompose the DFT by recursively\ncompressing the input signal and applying global frequency shifts (to get\nodd-indexed DFT coefficients). We show that this new structure can relax the\npower-of-two assumption of the radix-2 FFT by enabling signal input lengths\nsuch as $N=c\\cdot 2^k$ (for $k\\geq 0$ and a non-power-of-two $c>0$). Thus, our\nalgorithm potentially outperforms radix-2 FFTs for the cases where significant\nzero-padding is needed.
