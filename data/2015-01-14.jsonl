{"title": "Quantifying Prosodic Variability in Middle English Alliterative Poetry", "abstract": "Interest in the mathematical structure of poetry dates back to at least the\n19th century: after retiring from his mathematics position, J. J. Sylvester\nwrote a book on prosody called $\\textit{The Laws of Verse}$. Today there is\ninterest in the computer analysis of poems, and this paper discusses how a\nstatistical approach can be applied to this task. Starting with the definition\nof what Middle English alliteration is, $\\textit{Sir Gawain and the Green\nKnight}$ and William Langland's $\\textit{Piers Plowman}$ are used to illustrate\nthe methodology. Theory first developed for analyzing data from a Riemannian\nmanifold turns out to be applicable to strings allowing one to compute a\ngeneralized mean and variance for textual data, which is applied to the poems\nabove. The ratio of these two variances produces the analogue of the F test,\nand resampling allows p-values to be estimated. Consequently, this methodology\nprovides a way to compare prosodic variability between two texts.", "published": "2015-01-14 00:06:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03214v1", "categories": ["stat.AP", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "stat.AP"}
{"title": "Hard to Cheat: A Turing Test based on Answering Questions about Images", "abstract": "Progress in language and image understanding by machines has sparkled the\ninterest of the research community in more open-ended, holistic tasks, and\nrefueled an old AI dream of building intelligent machines. We discuss a few\nprominent challenges that characterize such holistic tasks and argue for\n\"question answering about images\" as a particular appealing instance of such a\nholistic task. In particular, we point out that it is a version of a Turing\nTest that is likely to be more robust to over-interpretations and contrast it\nwith tasks like grounding and generation of descriptions. Finally, we discuss\ntools to measure progress in this field.", "published": "2015-01-14 10:38:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03302v2", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
