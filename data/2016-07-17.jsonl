{"title": "An Empirical Evaluation of various Deep Learning Architectures for\n  Bi-Sequence Classification Tasks", "abstract": "Several tasks in argumentation mining and debating, question-answering, and\nnatural language inference involve classifying a sequence in the context of\nanother sequence (referred as bi-sequence classification). For several single\nsequence classification tasks, the current state-of-the-art approaches are\nbased on recurrent and convolutional neural networks. On the other hand, for\nbi-sequence classification problems, there is not much understanding as to the\nbest deep learning architecture. In this paper, we attempt to get an\nunderstanding of this category of problems by extensive empirical evaluation of\n19 different deep learning architectures (specifically on different ways of\nhandling context) for various problems originating in natural language\nprocessing like debating, textual entailment and question-answering. Following\nthe empirical evaluation, we offer our insights and conclusions regarding the\narchitectures we have considered. We also establish the first deep learning\nbaselines for three argumentation mining tasks.", "published": "2016-07-17 11:15:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04853v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
