{"title": "An Inter-lingual Reference Approach For Multi-Lingual Ontology Matching", "abstract": "Ontologies are considered as the backbone of the Semantic Web. With the\nrising success of the Semantic Web, the number of participating communities\nfrom different countries is constantly increasing. The growing number of\nontologies available in different natural languages leads to an\ninteroperability problem. In this paper, we discuss several approaches for\nontology matching; examine similarities and differences, identify weaknesses,\nand compare the existing automated approaches with the manual approaches for\nintegrating multilingual ontologies. In addition to that, we propose a new\narchitecture for a multilingual ontology matching service. As a case study we\nused an example of two multilingual enterprise ontologies - the university\nontology of Freie Universitaet Berlin and the ontology for Fayoum University in\nEgypt.", "published": "2013-09-25 20:13:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6650v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL", "I.2.4; I.2.7; I.2"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
