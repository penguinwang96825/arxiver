{"title": "Recognizing Temporal Linguistic Expression Pattern of Individual with\n  Suicide Risk on Social Media", "abstract": "Suicide is a global public health problem. Early detection of individual\nsuicide risk plays a key role in suicide prevention. In this paper, we propose\nto look into individual suicide risk through time series analysis of personal\nlinguistic expression on social media (Weibo). We examined temporal patterns of\nthe linguistic expression of individuals on Chinese social media (Weibo). Then,\nwe used such temporal patterns as predictor variables to build classification\nmodels for estimating levels of individual suicide risk. Characteristics of\ntime sequence curves to linguistic features including parentheses, auxiliary\nverbs, personal pronouns and body words are reported to affect performance of\nsuicide most, and the predicting model has a accuracy higher than 0.60, shown\nby the results. This paper confirms the efficiency of the social media data in\ndetecting individual suicide risk. Results of this study may be insightful for\nimproving the performance of suicide prevention programs.", "published": "2015-11-30 06:15:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09173v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Modeling Dynamic Relationships Between Characters in Literary Novels", "abstract": "Studying characters plays a vital role in computationally representing and\ninterpreting narratives. Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring\ncharacter roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships.\nRather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize\nthat relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the\nnarrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured\nprediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised framework to learn\nrelationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present\na Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the\nrelationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and\nsemantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate\nthe textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a\nframework outperforms competitive baselines.", "published": "2015-11-30 16:32:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09376v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Ask, and shall you receive?: Understanding Desire Fulfillment in Natural\n  Language Text", "abstract": "The ability to comprehend wishes or desires and their fulfillment is\nimportant to Natural Language Understanding. This paper introduces the task of\nidentifying if a desire expressed by a subject in a given short piece of text\nwas fulfilled. We propose various unstructured and structured models that\ncapture fulfillment cues such as the subject's emotional state and actions. Our\nexperiments with two different datasets demonstrate the importance of\nunderstanding the narrative and discourse structure to address this task.", "published": "2015-11-30 20:37:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09460v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Aspect-based Opinion Summarization with Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper considers Aspect-based Opinion Summarization (AOS) of reviews on\nparticular products. To enable real applications, an AOS system needs to\naddress two core subtasks, aspect extraction and sentiment classification. Most\nexisting approaches to aspect extraction, which use linguistic analysis or\ntopic modeling, are general across different products but not precise enough or\nsuitable for particular products. Instead we take a less general but more\nprecise scheme, directly mapping each review sentence into pre-defined aspects.\nTo tackle aspect mapping and sentiment classification, we propose two\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods, cascaded CNN and multitask\nCNN. Cascaded CNN contains two levels of convolutional networks. Multiple CNNs\nat level 1 deal with aspect mapping task, and a single CNN at level 2 deals\nwith sentiment classification. Multitask CNN also contains multiple aspect CNNs\nand a sentiment CNN, but different networks share the same word embeddings.\nExperimental results indicate that both cascaded and multitask CNNs outperform\nSVM-based methods by large margins. Multitask CNN generally performs better\nthan cascaded CNN.", "published": "2015-11-30 01:46:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09128v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
