{"title": "Semantics of the Black-Box: Can knowledge graphs help make deep learning systems more interpretable and explainable?", "abstract": "The recent series of innovations in deep learning (DL) have shown enormous potential to impact individuals and society, both positively and negatively. The DL models utilizing massive computing power and enormous datasets have significantly outperformed prior historical benchmarks on increasingly difficult, well-defined research tasks across technology domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, signal processing, and human-computer interactions. However, the Black-Box nature of DL models and their over-reliance on massive amounts of data condensed into labels and dense representations poses challenges for interpretability and explainability of the system. Furthermore, DLs have not yet been proven in their ability to effectively utilize relevant domain knowledge and experience critical to human understanding. This aspect is missing in early data-focused approaches and necessitated knowledge-infused learning and other strategies to incorporate computational knowledge. This article demonstrates how knowledge, provided as a knowledge graph, is incorporated into DL methods using knowledge-infused learning, which is one of the strategies. We then discuss how this makes a fundamental difference in the interpretability and explainability of current approaches, and illustrate it with examples from natural language processing for healthcare and education applications.", "published": "2020-10-16 22:55:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08660v4", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "A Conglomerate of Multiple OCR Table Detection and Extraction", "abstract": "Information representation as tables are compact and concise method that eases searching, indexing, and storage requirements. Extracting and cloning tables from parsable documents is easier and widely used, however industry still faces challenge in detecting and extracting tables from OCR documents or images. This paper proposes an algorithm that detects and extracts multiple tables from OCR document. The algorithm uses a combination of image processing techniques, text recognition and procedural coding to identify distinct tables in same image and map the text to appropriate corresponding cell in dataframe which can be stored as Comma-separated values, Database, Excel and multiple other usable formats.", "published": "2020-10-16 18:56:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08591v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Information Coefficient as a Performance Measure of Stock Selection Models", "abstract": "Information coefficient (IC) is a widely used metric for measuring investment managers' skills in selecting stocks. However, its adequacy and effectiveness for evaluating stock selection models has not been clearly understood, as IC from a realistic stock selection model can hardly be materially different from zero and is often accompanies with high volatility. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of IC as a performance measure of stick selection models. Through simulation and simple statistical modeling, we examine the IC behavior both statically and dynamically. The examination helps us propose two practical procedures that one may use for IC-based ongoing performance monitoring of stock selection models.", "published": "2020-10-16 19:40:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08601v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "q-fin.RM", "stat.AP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
