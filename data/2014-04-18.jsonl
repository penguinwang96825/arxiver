{"title": "Radical-Enhanced Chinese Character Embedding", "abstract": "We present a method to leverage radical for learning Chinese character\nembedding. Radical is a semantic and phonetic component of Chinese character.\nIt plays an important role as characters with the same radical usually have\nsimilar semantic meaning and grammatical usage. However, existing Chinese\nprocessing algorithms typically regard word or character as the basic unit but\nignore the crucial radical information. In this paper, we fill this gap by\nleveraging radical for learning continuous representation of Chinese character.\nWe develop a dedicated neural architecture to effectively learn character\nembedding and apply it on Chinese character similarity judgement and Chinese\nword segmentation. Experiment results show that our radical-enhanced method\noutperforms existing embedding learning algorithms on both tasks.", "published": "2014-04-18 07:48:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4714v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Challenges in Persian Electronic Text Analysis", "abstract": "Farsi, also known as Persian, is the official language of Iran and Tajikistan\nand one of the two main languages spoken in Afghanistan. Farsi enjoys a unified\nArabic script as its writing system. In this paper we briefly introduce the\nwriting standards of Farsi and highlight problems one would face when analyzing\nFarsi electronic texts, especially during development of Farsi corpora\nregarding to transcription and encoding of Farsi e-texts. The pointes mentioned\nmay sounds easy but they are crucial when developing and processing written\ncorpora of Farsi.", "published": "2014-04-18 10:30:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4740v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50", "I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
