{"title": "Inferring Robot Task Plans from Human Team Meetings: A Generative\n  Modeling Approach with Logic-Based Prior", "abstract": "We aim to reduce the burden of programming and deploying autonomous systems\nto work in concert with people in time-critical domains, such as military field\noperations and disaster response. Deployment plans for these operations are\nfrequently negotiated on-the-fly by teams of human planners. A human operator\nthen translates the agreed upon plan into machine instructions for the robots.\nWe present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the\nfinal plan from a processed form of the human team's planning conversation. Our\napproach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan\nvalidation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans. This\nhybrid approach enables us to overcome the challenge of performing inference\nover the large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the\nteam planning session. We validate the algorithm through human subject\nexperimentation and show we are able to infer a human team's final plan with\n83% accuracy on average. We also describe a robot demonstration in which two\npeople plan and execute a first-response collaborative task with a PR2 robot.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates a logical\nplanning technique within a generative model to perform plan inference.", "published": "2013-06-05 02:17:11", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0963v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.RO", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
