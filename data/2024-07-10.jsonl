{"title": "Financial market geometry: The tube oscillator", "abstract": "Based on geometrical considerations, we propose a new oscillator for\ntechnical market analysis, the tube oscillator. This oscillator measures the\ntrending behavior of a fixed market instrument based on its past history. It is\nshown in an empirical analysis of the German DAX and the Forex EUR/USD exchange\nrate that a simple trading strategy based on this oscillator and fixed\nthreshold leads to consistent positive monthly returns of average magnitude of\n2% or more. The oscillator is derived from a broader understanding of the\ngeometric behavior of prices throughout a fixed period, which we term financial\nmarket geometry. The remarkable profit results of the presented technique show\nthat 1) prices of financial market instruments have a strong underlying\ndeterministic component which can be detected and quantified with a matching\napproach and 2) financial market geometry is capable of providing such\ndetectors.", "published": "2024-07-10 20:33:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08036v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "91-10"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
