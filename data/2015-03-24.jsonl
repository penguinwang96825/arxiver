{"title": "Measuring Software Quality in Use: State-of-the-Art and Research\n  Challenges", "abstract": "Software quality in use comprises quality from the user's perspective. It has\ngained its importance in e-government applications, mobile-based applications,\nembedded systems, and even business process development. User's decisions on\nsoftware acquisitions are often ad hoc or based on preference due to difficulty\nin quantitatively measuring software quality in use. But, why is quality-in-use\nmeasurement difficult? Although there are many software quality models, to the\nauthors' knowledge no works survey the challenges related to software\nquality-in-use measurement. This article has two main contributions: 1) it\nidentifies and explains major issues and challenges in measuring software\nquality in use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software\nquality models and highlights open research areas; and 2) it sheds light on a\nresearch direction that can be used to predict software quality in use. In\nshort, the quality-in-use measurement issues are related to the complexity of\nthe current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the\ncustomized software quality models. A sentiment analysis of software reviews is\nproposed to deal with these issues.", "published": "2015-03-24 07:35:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06934v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}
