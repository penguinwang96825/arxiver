{"title": "Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server", "abstract": "In this paper we describe the Microsoft COCO Caption dataset and evaluation\nserver. When completed, the dataset will contain over one and a half million\ncaptions describing over 330,000 images. For the training and validation\nimages, five independent human generated captions will be provided. To ensure\nconsistency in evaluation of automatic caption generation algorithms, an\nevaluation server is used. The evaluation server receives candidate captions\nand scores them using several popular metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE\nand CIDEr. Instructions for using the evaluation server are provided.", "published": "2015-04-01 18:13:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00325v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
