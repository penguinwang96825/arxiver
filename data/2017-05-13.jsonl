{"title": "Learning Semantic Correspondences in Technical Documentation", "abstract": "We consider the problem of translating high-level textual descriptions to\nformal representations in technical documentation as part of an effort to model\nthe meaning of such documentation. We focus specifically on the problem of\nlearning translational correspondences between text descriptions and grounded\nrepresentations in the target documentation, such as formal representation of\nfunctions or code templates. Our approach exploits the parallel nature of such\ndocumentation, or the tight coupling between high-level text and the low-level\nrepresentations we aim to learn. Data is collected by mining technical\ndocuments for such parallel text-representation pairs, which we use to train a\nsimple semantic parsing model. We report new baseline results on sixteen novel\ndatasets, including the standard library documentation for nine popular\nprogramming languages across seven natural languages, and a small collection of\nUnix utility manuals.", "published": "2017-05-13 12:29:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04815v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Annotating and Modeling Empathy in Spoken Conversations", "abstract": "Empathy, as defined in behavioral sciences, expresses the ability of human\nbeings to recognize, understand and react to emotions, attitudes and beliefs of\nothers. The lack of an operational definition of empathy makes it difficult to\nmeasure it. In this paper, we address two related problems in automatic\naffective behavior analysis: the design of the annotation protocol and the\nautomatic recognition of empathy from spoken conversations. We propose and\nevaluate an annotation scheme for empathy inspired by the modal model of\nemotions. The annotation scheme was evaluated on a corpus of real-life, dyadic\nspoken conversations. In the context of behavioral analysis, we designed an\nautomatic segmentation and classification system for empathy. Given the\ndifferent speech and language levels of representation where empathy may be\ncommunicated, we investigated features derived from the lexical and acoustic\nspaces. The feature development process was designed to support both the fusion\nand automatic selection of relevant features from high dimensional space. The\nautomatic classification system was evaluated on call center conversations\nwhere it showed significantly better performance than the baseline.", "published": "2017-05-13 14:49:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04839v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "I.2; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
