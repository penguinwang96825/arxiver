{"title": "Impact of Feature Selection on Micro-Text Classification", "abstract": "Social media datasets, especially Twitter tweets, are popular in the field of\ntext classification. Tweets are a valuable source of micro-text (sometimes\nreferred to as \"micro-blogs\"), and have been studied in domains such as\nsentiment analysis, recommendation systems, spam detection, clustering, among\nothers. Tweets often include keywords referred to as \"Hashtags\" that can be\nused as labels for the tweet. Using tweets encompassing 50 labels, we studied\nthe impact of word versus character-level feature selection and extraction on\ndifferent learners to solve a multi-class classification task. We show that\nfeature extraction of simple character-level groups performs better than simple\nword groups and pre-processing methods like normalizing using Porter's Stemming\nand Part-of-Speech (\"POS\")-Lemmatization.", "published": "2017-08-27 18:50:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08123v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
