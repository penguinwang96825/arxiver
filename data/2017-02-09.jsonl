{"title": "Challenges in Providing Automatic Affective Feedback in Instant\n  Messaging Applications", "abstract": "Instant messaging is one of the major channels of computer mediated\ncommunication. However, humans are known to be very limited in understanding\nothers' emotions via text-based communication. Aiming on introducing emotion\nsensing technologies to instant messaging, we developed EmotionPush, a system\nthat automatically detects the emotions of the messages end-users received on\nFacebook Messenger and provides colored cues on their smartphones accordingly.\nWe conducted a deployment study with 20 participants during a time span of two\nweeks. In this paper, we revealed five challenges, along with examples, that we\nobserved in our study based on both user's feedback and chat logs, including\n(i)the continuum of emotions, (ii)multi-user conversations, (iii)different\ndynamics between different users, (iv)misclassification of emotions and\n(v)unconventional content. We believe this discussion will benefit the future\nexploration of affective computing for instant messaging, and also shed light\non research of conversational emotion sensing.", "published": "2017-02-09 08:00:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02736v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC", "H.5.2; H.5.3; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Mining User/Movie Preferred Features Based on Reviews for Video\n  Recommendation System", "abstract": "In this work, we present an approach for mining user preferences and\nrecommendation based on reviews. There have been various studies worked on\nrecommendation problem. However, most of the studies beyond one aspect user\ngenerated- content such as user ratings, user feedback and so on to state user\npreferences. There is a prob- lem in one aspect mining is lacking for stating\nuser preferences. As a demonstration, in collaborative filter recommendation,\nwe try to figure out the preference trend of crowded users, then use that trend\nto predict current user preference. Therefore, there is a gap between real user\npreferences and the trend of the crowded people. Additionally, user preferences\ncan be addressed from mining user reviews since user often comment about\nvarious aspects of products. To solve this problem, we mainly focus on mining\nproduct aspects and user aspects inside user reviews to directly state user\npreferences. We also take into account Social Network Analysis for cold-start\nitem problem. With cold-start user problem, collaborative filter algorithm is\nemployed in our work. The framework is general enough to be applied to\ndifferent recommendation domains. Theoretically, our method would achieve a\nsignificant enhancement.", "published": "2017-02-09 08:03:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02737v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
