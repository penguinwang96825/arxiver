This architecture reduces storage redundancy\nand overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation.

Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method.

Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --\nmodels must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid\nhallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:\napproaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those\nthat encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct\nanswers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we\npresent TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly\noptimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using\nGRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct\nanswers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce\nhallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling\nabstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive\nexperiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to\nvanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves\ntruthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models\n(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups.

A recent example of such sharing,\nbetween commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where\nunlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor\nincumbents, primarily fixed microwave links.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding.

This dependence, which can manifest itself even as\nsimple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be\nindependently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and\ntheoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this\noverlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that\ndegrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test\nset metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random\nsets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a\ncritical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient\ndescent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained\nmodel. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail.

{"title": "Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem", "abstract": "Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important\nconcern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks\nbefore deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware\nthat they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous\ncapabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in\nsafety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or\nretrained. Such strategic deception - often known as \"sandbagging\" - threatens\nto undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of\nvalue to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns\nthat demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are\nconsistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of\nstrategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the\nrecently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that\nthis problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and\nconstruct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and\nincompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we\ninvestigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between\nsuch behaviours in bandit models.

However, existing PRMs either\ntreat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step\ndependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.\nConsequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in\nsequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations\nmake downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal\nperformance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that\nframes LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The\nreward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps\nbut also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By\nenforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal\nrelationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing\nprecise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit\nassignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,\nthe rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.\nExperiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning\ndemonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering\na principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning.

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges\nposed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between\nexploration and exploitation.
