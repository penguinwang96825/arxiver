{"title": "Financial Analysis: Intelligent Financial Data Analysis System Based on LLM-RAG", "abstract": "In the modern financial sector, the exponential growth of data has made\nefficient and accurate financial data analysis increasingly crucial.\nTraditional methods, such as statistical analysis and rule-based systems, often\nstruggle to process and derive meaningful insights from complex financial\ninformation effectively. These conventional approaches face inherent\nlimitations in handling unstructured data, capturing intricate market patterns,\nand adapting to rapidly evolving financial contexts, resulting in reduced\naccuracy and delayed decision-making processes. To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents an intelligent financial data analysis system that\nintegrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) technology. Our system incorporates three key components: a specialized\npreprocessing module for financial data standardization, an efficient\nvector-based storage and retrieval system, and a RAG-enhanced query processing\nmodule. Using the NASDAQ financial fundamentals dataset from 2010 to 2023, we\nconducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate system performance. Results\ndemonstrate significant improvements across multiple metrics: the fully\noptimized configuration (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106+RAG) achieved 78.6% accuracy and\n89.2% recall, surpassing the baseline model by 23 percentage points in accuracy\nwhile reducing response time by 34.8%. The system also showed enhanced\nefficiency in handling complex financial queries, though with a moderate\nincrease in memory utilization. Our findings validate the effectiveness of\nintegrating RAG technology with LLMs for financial analysis tasks and provide\nvaluable insights for future developments in intelligent financial data\nprocessing systems.", "published": "2025-03-20 21:19:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06279v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
