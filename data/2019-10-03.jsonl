{"title": "The Numerical Simulation of Quanto Option Prices Using Bayesian Statistical Methods", "abstract": "In the paper, the pricing of Quanto options is studied, where the underlying foreign asset and the exchange rate are correlated with each other. Firstly, we adopt Bayesian methods to estimate unknown parameters entering the pricing formula of Quanto options, including the volatility of stock, the volatility of exchange rate and the correlation. Secondly, we compute and predict prices of different four types of Quanto options based on Bayesian posterior prediction techniques and Monte Carlo methods. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the advantage of Bayesian method used in this paper comparing with some other existing methods. This paper is a new application of the Bayesian methods in the pricing of multi-asset options.", "published": "2019-10-03 14:40:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04075v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
