{"title": "Power law in website ratings", "abstract": "In the practical work of websites popularization, analysis of their efficiency and downloading it is of key importance to take into account web-ratings data. The main indicators of website traffic include the number of unique hosts from which the analyzed website was addressed and the number of granted web pages (hits) per unit time (for example, day, month or year). Of certain interest is the ratio between the number of hits (S) and hosts (H). In practice there is even used such a concept as \"average number of viewed pages\" (S/H), which on default supposes a linear dependence of S on H. What actually happens is that linear dependence is observed only as a partial case of power dependence, and not always. Another new power law has been discovered on the Internet, in particular, on the WWW.", "published": "2010-06-17 10:52:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3425v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.IT", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
