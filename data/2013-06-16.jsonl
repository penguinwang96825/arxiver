{"title": "An open diachronic corpus of historical Spanish: annotation criteria and\n  automatic modernisation of spelling", "abstract": "The IMPACT-es diachronic corpus of historical Spanish compiles over one\nhundred books --containing approximately 8 million words-- in addition to a\ncomplementary lexicon which links more than 10 thousand lemmas with\nattestations of the different variants found in the documents. This textual\ncorpus and the accompanying lexicon have been released under an open license\n(Creative Commons by-nc-sa) in order to permit their intensive exploitation in\nlinguistic research. Approximately 7% of the words in the corpus (a selection\naimed at enhancing the coverage of the most frequent word forms) have been\nannotated with their lemma, part of speech, and modern equivalent. This paper\ndescribes the annotation criteria followed and the standards, based on the Text\nEncoding Initiative recommendations, used to the represent the texts in digital\nform. As an illustration of the possible synergies between diachronic textual\nresources and linguistic research, we describe the application of statistical\nmachine translation techniques to infer probabilistic context-sensitive rules\nfor the automatic modernisation of spelling. The automatic modernisation with\nthis type of statistical methods leads to very low character error rates when\nthe output is compared with the supervised modern version of the text.", "published": "2013-06-16 18:19:15", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3692v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.DL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
