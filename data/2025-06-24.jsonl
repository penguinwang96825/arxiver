The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.

{"title": "Scaling Speculative Decoding with Lookahead Reasoning", "abstract": "Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the\nresulting thousands of tokens is slow.

This\nmeans allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic\nceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,\nand each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.\nIn Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future\nsteps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a\nverifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate\nany that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the\ntwo layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak\nspeedup of SD both theoretically and empirically.

For the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which\nconsists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the\nTask-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM).

Meanwhile, the TSM is\ntrained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,\neach of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing\nphase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the\nTSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the\ngeneralized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts.

However, variations\nin system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to\ndrastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for\nconstructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical\nsystems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and\nextrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were\nunseen during training.

Unlike\ntraditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each\ntoken depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects.

In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence.

A grasping agent\nthat both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the\nuncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act\nunder high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and\nuncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have\nconnected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method\nfor training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an\nimage-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We\ngenerate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real\nimages and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object\nvariability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects\njointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless\ncontribute to the same goal.", "published": "2025-06-24 22:53:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20045v2", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
{"title": "Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance", "abstract": "Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge\ndue to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and\nacquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated\nto clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the\nincreasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning\nguidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet\nbeen explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for\nultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for\nultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a\ntransformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object\ndetection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user\nquery is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through\nLLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding\nultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,\nassisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical\nexploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning\nguidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,\nincluding the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results\ndemonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by\nenhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.", "published": "2025-06-24 14:49:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19683v2", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "eess.IV"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
{"title": "Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment for Generative Semantic Communications in AIGC Provisioning Tasks", "abstract": "Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to\nedges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.\nGenerative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by\ntransmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent\nrepresentations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on\nthe alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that\npossessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless\ntransmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this\npaper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm\nfor GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the\ncloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and\nused to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel\nconditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge\ndistillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,\nan optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge\ndistillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression\nrates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment\nbetween the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.\nMoreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the\nbaseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.", "published": "2025-06-24 10:50:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19893v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.IT", "eess.IV", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Global and Local Contrastive Learning for Joint Representations from Cardiac MRI and ECG", "abstract": "An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for\ndetecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our\nresults highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac\ndiagnostics using ECG.

The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the\nposterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly.\nHowever, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and\nthe degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy\nperformance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a\ndistributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the\ncontroller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence\nneighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in\neconomics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization\nsettings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation.\nCombining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are\nable to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our\nnumerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture.
