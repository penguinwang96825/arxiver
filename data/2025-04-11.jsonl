{"title": "International Financial Markets Through 150 Years: Evaluating Stylized Facts", "abstract": "In the theory of financial markets, a stylized fact is a qualitative summary\nof a pattern in financial market data that is observed across multiple assets,\nasset classes and time horizons. In this article, we test a set of eleven\nstylized facts for financial market data. Our main contribution is to consider\na broad range of geographical regions across Asia, continental Europe, and the\nUS over a time period of 150 years, as well as two of the most traded\ncryptocurrencies, thus providing insights into the robustness and\ngeneralizability of commonly known stylized facts.", "published": "2025-04-11 15:19:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08611v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.GN", "62P05"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
