{"title": "CRF-based Named Entity Recognition @ICON 2013", "abstract": "This paper describes performance of CRF based systems for Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) in Indian language as a part of ICON 2013 shared task. In\nthis task we have considered a set of language independent features for all the\nlanguages. Only for English a language specific feature, i.e. capitalization,\nhas been added. Next the use of gazetteer is explored for Bengali, Hindi and\nEnglish. The gazetteers are built from Wikipedia and other sources. Test\nresults show that the system achieves the highest F measure of 88% for English\nand the lowest F measure of 69% for both Tamil and Telugu. Note that for the\nleast performing two languages no gazetteer was used. NER in Bengali and Hindi\nfinds accuracy (F measure) of 87% and 79%, respectively.", "published": "2014-09-29 07:11:30", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8008v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Improving the Performance of English-Tamil Statistical Machine\n  Translation System using Source-Side Pre-Processing", "abstract": "Machine Translation is one of the major oldest and the most active research\narea in Natural Language Processing. Currently, Statistical Machine Translation\n(SMT) dominates the Machine Translation research. Statistical Machine\nTranslation is an approach to Machine Translation which uses models to learn\ntranslation patterns directly from data, and generalize them to translate a new\nunseen text. The SMT approach is largely language independent, i.e. the models\ncan be applied to any language pair. Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)\nattempts to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual\ntext corpora. Where such corpora are available, excellent results can be\nattained translating similar texts, but such corpora are still not available\nfor many language pairs. Statistical Machine Translation systems, in general,\nhave difficulty in handling the morphology on the source or the target side\nespecially for morphologically rich languages. Errors in morphology or syntax\nin the target language can have severe consequences on meaning of the sentence.\nThey change the grammatical function of words or the understanding of the\nsentence through the incorrect tense information in verb. Baseline SMT also\nknown as Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) system does not\nuse any linguistic information and it only operates on surface word form.\nRecent researches shown that adding linguistic information helps to improve the\naccuracy of the translation with less amount of bilingual corpora. Adding\nlinguistic information can be done using the Factored Statistical Machine\nTranslation system through pre-processing steps. This paper investigates about\nhow English side pre-processing is used to improve the accuracy of\nEnglish-Tamil SMT system.", "published": "2014-09-29 04:54:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8581v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Controversy and Sentiment in Online News", "abstract": "How do news sources tackle controversial issues? In this work, we take a\ndata-driven approach to understand how controversy interplays with emotional\nexpression and biased language in the news. We begin by introducing a new\ndataset of controversial and non-controversial terms collected using\ncrowdsourcing. Then, focusing on 15 major U.S. news outlets, we compare\nmillions of articles discussing controversial and non-controversial issues over\na span of 7 months. We find that in general, when it comes to controversial\nissues, the use of negative affect and biased language is prevalent, while the\nuse of strong emotion is tempered. We also observe many differences across news\nsources. Using these findings, we show that we can indicate to what extent an\nissue is controversial, by comparing it with other issues in terms of how they\nare portrayed across different media.", "published": "2014-09-29 15:23:50", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8152v1", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Arabic Spelling Correction using Supervised Learning", "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of spelling correction in the Arabic\nlanguage utilizing the new corpus provided by QALB (Qatar Arabic Language Bank)\nproject which is an annotated corpus of sentences with errors and their\ncorrections. The corpus contains edit, add before, split, merge, add after,\nmove and other error types. We are concerned with the first four error types as\nthey contribute more than 90% of the spelling errors in the corpus. The\nproposed system has many models to address each error type on its own and then\nintegrating all the models to provide an efficient and robust system that\nachieves an overall recall of 0.59, precision of 0.58 and F1 score of 0.58\nincluding all the error types on the development set. Our system participated\nin the QALB 2014 shared task \"Automatic Arabic Error Correction\" and achieved\nan F1 score of 0.6, earning the sixth place out of nine participants.", "published": "2014-09-29 20:18:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8309v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "The Utility of Text: The Case of Amicus Briefs and the Supreme Court", "abstract": "We explore the idea that authoring a piece of text is an act of maximizing\none's expected utility. To make this idea concrete, we consider the societally\nimportant decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Extensive past\nwork in quantitative political science provides a framework for empirically\nmodeling the decisions of justices and how they relate to text. We incorporate\ninto such a model texts authored by amici curiae (\"friends of the court\"\nseparate from the litigants) who seek to weigh in on the decision, then\nexplicitly model their goals in a random utility model.
