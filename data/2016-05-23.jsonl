{"title": "Towards Multi-Agent Communication-Based Language Learning", "abstract": "We propose an interactive multimodal framework for language learning. Instead\nof being passively exposed to large amounts of natural text, our learners\n(implemented as feed-forward neural networks) engage in cooperative referential\ngames starting from a tabula rasa setup, and thus develop their own language\nfrom the need to communicate in order to succeed at the game. Preliminary\nexperiments provide promising results, but also suggest that it is important to\nensure that agents trained in this way do not develop an adhoc communication\ncode only effective for the game they are playing", "published": "2016-05-23 18:46:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07133v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.CV", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
