{"title": "Topic Modelling and Event Identification from Twitter Textual Data", "abstract": "The tremendous growth of social media content on the Internet has inspired\nthe development of the text analytics to understand and solve real-life\nproblems. Leveraging statistical topic modelling helps researchers and\npractitioners in better comprehension of textual content as well as provides\nuseful information for further analysis. Statistical topic modelling becomes\nespecially important when we work with large volumes of dynamic text, e.g.,\nFacebook or Twitter datasets. In this study, we summarize the message content\nof four data sets of Twitter messages relating to challenging social events in\nKenya. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling to analyze the\ncontent. Our study uses two evaluation measures, Normalized Mutual Information\n(NMI) and topic coherence analysis, to select the best LDA models. The obtained\nLDA results show that the tool can be effectively used to extract discussion\ntopics and summarize them for further manual analysis", "published": "2016-08-08 17:03:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02519v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL", "D.4.8; H.1.2; H.2.8; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}
{"title": "Detecting Sarcasm in Multimodal Social Platforms", "abstract": "Sarcasm is a peculiar form of sentiment expression, where the surface\nsentiment differs from the implied sentiment. The detection of sarcasm in\nsocial media platforms has been applied in the past mainly to textual\nutterances where lexical indicators (such as interjections and intensifiers),\nlinguistic markers, and contextual information (such as user profiles, or past\nconversations) were used to detect the sarcastic tone. However, modern social\nmedia platforms allow to create multimodal messages where audiovisual content\nis integrated with the text, making the analysis of a mode in isolation\npartial. In our work, we first study the relationship between the textual and\nvisual aspects in multimodal posts from three major social media platforms,\ni.e., Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter, and we run a crowdsourcing task to\nquantify the extent to which images are perceived as necessary by human\nannotators. Moreover, we propose two different computational frameworks to\ndetect sarcasm that integrate the textual and visual modalities. The first\napproach exploits visual semantics trained on an external dataset, and\nconcatenates the semantics features with state-of-the-art textual features. The\nsecond method adapts a visual neural network initialized with parameters\ntrained on ImageNet to multimodal sarcastic posts. Results show the positive\neffect of combining modalities for the detection of sarcasm across platforms\nand methods.", "published": "2016-08-08 00:59:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02289v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL", "cs.MM"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}

Our system improves upon previous neural network\nbased models by utilizing recent advances in syntactic parsing -- Google's\nSyntaxNet -- to augment character-level recurrent neural networks.
