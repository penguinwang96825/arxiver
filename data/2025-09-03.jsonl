LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an\nepisodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query\nsubsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,\ntraining-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large\nstructured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature\ndimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,\nmissingness, and sample-to-feature ratios.

Most state-of-the-art solutions\nhave primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a\nconsiderable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,\nspecifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of\nisolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of\ncontinuous speech contribute to this issue.

Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens.

For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that\neffective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a\ntailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific\ndesign context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability\nthrough AI-assisted code analysis.", "published": "2025-09-03 07:48:38", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03093v1", "categories": ["cs.SE", "cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.SE"}

Typically, a higher quality\nrepresentation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.\nHowever, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device\nmemory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs\nwith high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering\nlatencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this\nwork, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed\n3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a\nlittle loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a\nset of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby\nsignificantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been\ndemonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,\ndirectly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.\nContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in\ncodebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a\nBayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that\neffectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these\ncompressed representations.

Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8%\n(PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism\nenables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a\npractical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.", "published": "2025-09-03 07:08:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070v2", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Human-LLM Synergy in Context-Aware Adaptive Architecture for Scalable Drone Swarm Operation", "abstract": "The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions\nnecessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination\nsystems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and\nunpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and\nconnectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive\narchitecture for drone swarms, leveraging a Large Language Model to dynamically\nselect the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based\non real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and\ncommunication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,\nadaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and\nmaintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static\nmodels in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity. These\nresults highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,\nadaptable, and resilient solution for real world disaster response scenarios.", "published": "2025-09-03 11:46:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05355v1", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.RO"}
{"title": "Nonnegative matrix factorization and the principle of the common cause", "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction\nmethod. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological\napproach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model\nfor the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that\nthese two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored\nreciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently\nmapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool\nthat leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other\nestimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our\nestimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented\naround this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against\nnoise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving\nthe NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an\ninteresting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger\nand positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via\nthe independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data\npoints with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also\nshow how NMF can be employed for data denoising.", "published": "2025-09-03 19:02:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03652v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "physics.data-an", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,\ndata representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage\nin which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.\nOur experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering\ngranularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization\nstrategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and\nphonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,\nuncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns.

{"title": "Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text\nembedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the\nembedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].\nHowever, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the\nsemantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,\nespecially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training\nstage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token\nembedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,\nnamely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based\nDocument-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and\nreconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM\nperformance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.", "published": "2025-09-03 04:55:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
