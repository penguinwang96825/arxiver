{"title": "The mighty force: statistical inference and high-dimensional statistics", "abstract": "This is a review to appear as a contribution to the edited volume \"Spin Glass Theory & Far Beyond - Replica Symmetry Breaking after 40 Years\", World Scientific. It showcases a selection of contributions from the spin glass community at large to high-dimensional statistics, by focusing on three important graph-based models and methodologies having deeply impacted the field: inference of graphs (a.k.a. direct coupling analysis), inference from graphs (the community detection problem), and the dynamic cavity method, which in particular allows for inference from graphs encoding causal relations.", "published": "2022-05-02 08:57:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00750v1", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "cs.IT"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.dis-nn"}
{"title": "Fitting Generalized Tempered Stable distribution: Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) Approach", "abstract": "The paper investigates the rich class of Generalized Tempered Stable distribution, an alternative to Normal distribution and the $\u03b1$-Stable distribution for modelling asset return and many physical and economic systems. Firstly, we explore some important properties of the Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution. The theoretical tools developed are used to perform empirical analysis. The GTS distribution is fitted using S&P 500, SPY ETF and Bitcoin BTC. The Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) technique evaluates the probability density function and its derivatives in the maximum likelihood procedure. Based on the results from the statistical inference and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit, the GTS distribution fits the underlying distribution of the SPY ETF return. The right side of the Bitcoin BTC return, and the left side of the S&P 500 return underlying distributions fit the Tempered Stable distribution; while the left side of the Bitcoin BTC return and the right side of the S&P 500 return underlying distributions are modelled by the compound Poisson process", "published": "2022-05-02 00:11:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00586v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "math.PR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
{"title": "Cluster-based Regression using Variational Inference and Applications in Financial Forecasting", "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to simultaneously identify clusters and estimate cluster-specific regression parameters from the given data. Such an approach can be useful in learning the relationship between input and output when the regression parameters for estimating output are different in different regions of the input space. Variational Inference (VI), a machine learning approach to obtain posterior probability densities using optimization techniques, is used to identify clusters of explanatory variables and regression parameters for each cluster. From these results, one can obtain both the expected value and the full distribution of predicted output. Other advantages of the proposed approach include the elegant theoretical solution and clear interpretability of results. The proposed approach is well-suited for financial forecasting where markets have different regimes (or clusters) with different patterns and correlations of market changes in each regime. In financial applications, knowledge about such clusters can provide useful insights about portfolio performance and identify the relative importance of variables in different market regimes. An illustrative example of predicting one-day S&P change is considered to illustrate the approach and compare the performance of the proposed approach with standard regression without clusters. Due to the broad applicability of the problem, its elegant theoretical solution, and the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the approach may be useful in a number of areas extending beyond the financial domain.", "published": "2022-05-02 01:19:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00605v3", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "cs.LG", "stat.ME", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
