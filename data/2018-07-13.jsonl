{"title": "Characterising AT-free Graphs with BFS", "abstract": "An asteroidal triple free graph is a graph such that for every independent triple of vertices no path between any two avoids the third. In a recent result from Corneil and Stacho, these graphs were characterised through a linear vertex ordering called an AT-free order. Here, we use techniques from abstract convex geometry to improve on this result by giving a vertex order characterisation with stronger structural properties and thus resolve an open question by Corneil and Stacho. These orderings are generated by a modification of BFS which runs in polynomial time. Furthermore, we give a linear time algorithm which employs multiple applications of (L)BFS to compute AT-free orders in claw-free AT-free graphs and a generalisation of these.", "published": "2018-07-13 13:31:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05065v1", "categories": ["cs.DM"], "primary_category": "cs.DM"}
{"title": "Bridging the Gap Between Layout Pattern Sampling and Hotspot Detection via Batch Active Learning", "abstract": "Layout hotpot detection is one of the main steps in modern VLSI design. A typical hotspot detection flow is extremely time consuming due to the computationally expensive mask optimization and lithographic simulation. Recent researches try to facilitate the procedure with a reduced flow including feature extraction, training set generation and hotspot detection, where feature extraction methods and hotspot detection engines are deeply studied. However, the performance of hotspot detectors relies highly on the quality of reference layout libraries which are costly to obtain and usually predetermined or randomly sampled in previous works. In this paper, we propose an active learning-based layout pattern sampling and hotspot detection flow, which simultaneously optimizes the machine learning model and the training set that aims to achieve similar or better hotspot detection performance with much smaller number of training instances. Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce lithography simulation overhead while attaining satisfactory detection accuracy on designs under both DUV and EUV lithography technologies.", "published": "2018-07-13 17:51:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06446v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "eess.IV", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Model Reconstruction from Model Explanations", "abstract": "We show through theory and experiment that gradient-based explanations of a model quickly reveal the model itself. Our results speak to a tension between the desire to keep a proprietary model secret and the ability to offer model explanations. On the theoretical side, we give an algorithm that provably learns a two-layer ReLU network in a setting where the algorithm may query the gradient of the model with respect to chosen inputs. The number of queries is independent of the dimension and nearly optimal in its dependence on the model size. Of interest not only from a learning-theoretic perspective, this result highlights the power of gradients rather than labels as a learning primitive. Complementing our theory, we give effective heuristics for reconstructing models from gradient explanations that are orders of magnitude more query-efficient than reconstruction attacks relying on prediction interfaces.", "published": "2018-07-13 17:15:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05185v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex AF and DF Relaying with Energy-Harvesting in Log-Normal Fading", "abstract": "Energy-harvesting (EH) and wireless power transfer in cooperative relaying networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of research attention. Most of the existing work on this topic however focuses on Rayleigh fading channels, which represent outdoor environments. In contrast, this paper is dedicated to analyze the performance of dual-hop relaying systems with EH over indoor channels characterized by log-normal fading. Both half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) relaying mechanisms are studied in this work with decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocols. In addition, three EH schemes are investigated, namely, time switching relaying, power splitting relaying and ideal relaying receiver which serves as a lower bound. The system performance is evaluated in terms of the ergodic outage probability for which we derive accurate analytical expressions. Monte Carlo simulations are provided throughout to validate the accuracy of our analysis. Results reveal that, in both HD and FD scenarios, AF relaying performs only slightly worse than DF relaying which can make the former a more efficient solution when the processing energy cost at the DF relay is taken into account. It is also shown that FD relaying systems can generally outperform HD relaying schemes as long as the loop-back interference in FD is relatively small. Furthermore, increasing the variance of the log-normal channel has shown to deteriorate the performance in all the relaying and EH protocols considered.", "published": "2018-07-13 09:32:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05219v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
