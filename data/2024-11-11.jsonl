{"title": "An Empirical Implementation of the Shadow Riskless Rate", "abstract": "We address the problem of asset pricing in a market where there is no risky\nasset. Previous work developed a theoretical model for a shadow riskless rate\n(SRR) for such a market in terms of the drift component of the state-price\ndeflator for that asset universe. Assuming asset prices are modeled by\ncorrelated geometric Brownian motion, in this work we develop a computational\napproach to estimate the SRR from empirical datasets. The approach employs:\nprincipal component analysis to model the effects of the individual Brownian\nmotions; singular value decomposition to capture the abrupt changes in\ncondition number of the linear system whose solution provides the SRR values;\nand a regularization to control the rate of change of the condition number.\nAmong other uses (e.g., for option pricing, developing a term structure of\ninterest rate), the SRR can be employed as an investment discriminator between\nasset classes. We apply the computational procedure to markets consisting of\ngroups of stocks, varying asset type and number. The theoretical and\ncomputational analysis provides not only the drift, but also the total\nvolatility of the state-price deflator. We investigate the time trajectory of\nthese two descriptive components of the state-price deflator for the empirical\ndatasets.", "published": "2024-11-11 22:47:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07421v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
