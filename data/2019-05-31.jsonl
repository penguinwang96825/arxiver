{"title": "Evaluating Memento Service Optimizations", "abstract": "Services and applications based on the Memento Aggregator can suffer from slow response times due to the federated search across web archives performed by the Memento infrastructure. In an effort to decrease the response times, we established a cache system and experimented with machine learning models to predict archival holdings. We reported on the experimental results in previous work and can now, after these optimizations have been in production for two years, evaluate their efficiency, based on long-term log data. During our investigation we find that the cache is very effective with a 70-80% cache hit rate for human-driven services. The machine learning prediction operates at an acceptable average recall level of 0.727 but our results also show that a more frequent retraining of the models is needed to further improve prediction accuracy.", "published": "2019-05-31 20:09:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00058v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
