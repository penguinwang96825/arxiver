{"title": "Using qualia information to identify lexical semantic classes in an\n  unsupervised clustering task", "abstract": "Acquiring lexical information is a complex problem, typically approached by\nrelying on a number of contexts to contribute information for classification.\nOne of the first issues to address in this domain is the determination of such\ncontexts. The work presented here proposes the use of automatically obtained\nFORMAL role descriptors as features used to draw nouns from the same lexical\nsemantic class together in an unsupervised clustering task. We have dealt with\nthree lexical semantic classes (HUMAN, LOCATION and EVENT) in English. The\nresults obtained show that it is possible to discriminate between elements from\ndifferent lexical semantic classes using only FORMAL role information, hence\nvalidating our initial hypothesis. Also, iterating our method accurately\naccounts for fine-grained distinctions within lexical classes, namely\ndistinctions involving ambiguous expressions. Moreover, a filtering and\nbootstrapping strategy employed in extracting FORMAL role descriptors proved to\nminimize effects of sparse data and noise in our task.", "published": "2013-03-11 08:21:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2449v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Multilingual Semantic Wiki Based on Attempto Controlled English and\n  Grammatical Framework", "abstract": "We describe a semantic wiki system with an underlying controlled natural\nlanguage grammar implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF). The grammar\nrestricts the wiki content to a well-defined subset of Attempto Controlled\nEnglish (ACE), and facilitates a precise bidirectional automatic translation\nbetween ACE and language fragments of a number of other natural languages,\nmaking the wiki content accessible multilingually. Additionally, our approach\nallows for automatic translation into the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which\nenables automatic reasoning over the wiki content. The developed wiki\nenvironment thus allows users to build, query and view OWL knowledge bases via\na user-friendly multilingual natural language interface. As a further feature,\nthe underlying multilingual grammar is integrated into the wiki and can be\ncollaboratively edited to extend the vocabulary of the wiki or even customize\nits sentence structures. This work demonstrates the combination of the existing\ntechnologies of Attempto Controlled English and Grammatical Framework, and is\nimplemented as an extension of the existing semantic wiki engine AceWiki.", "published": "2013-03-11 08:10:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4293v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.HC"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
