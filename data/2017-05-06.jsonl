{"title": "Learning Distributed Representations of Texts and Entities from\n  Knowledge Base", "abstract": "We describe a neural network model that jointly learns distributed\nrepresentations of texts and knowledge base (KB) entities. Given a text in the\nKB, we train our proposed model to predict entities that are relevant to the\ntext. Our model is designed to be generic with the ability to address various\nNLP tasks with ease. We train the model using a large corpus of texts and their\nentity annotations extracted from Wikipedia. We evaluated the model on three\nimportant NLP tasks (i.e., sentence textual similarity, entity linking, and\nfactoid question answering) involving both unsupervised and supervised\nsettings. As a result, we achieved state-of-the-art results on all three of\nthese tasks.

{"title": "A neural network system for transformation of regional cuisine style", "abstract": "We propose a novel system which can transform a recipe into any selected\nregional style (e.g., Japanese, Mediterranean, or Italian). This system has two\ncharacteristics. First the system can identify the degree of regional cuisine\nstyle mixture of any selected recipe and visualize such regional cuisine style\nmixtures using barycentric Newton diagrams. Second, the system can suggest\ningredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe\nbecomes more authentic for any selected regional cuisine style. Drawing on a\nlarge number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system\ncan transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.", "published": "2017-05-06 18:35:35", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03487v2", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CY"}
{"title": "Analogical Inference for Multi-Relational Embeddings", "abstract": "Large-scale multi-relational embedding refers to the task of learning the\nlatent representations for entities and relations in large knowledge graphs. An\neffective and scalable solution for this problem is crucial for the true\nsuccess of knowledge-based inference in a broad range of applications. This\npaper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations with\nrespect to the \\textit{analogical} properties of the embedded entities and\nrelations. By formulating the learning objective in a differentiable fashion,\nour model enjoys both theoretical power and computational scalability, and\nsignificantly outperformed a large number of representative baseline methods on\nbenchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model offers an elegant unification of\nseveral well-known methods in multi-relational embedding, which can be proven\nto be special instantiations of our framework.", "published": "2017-05-06 01:40:28", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02426v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

{"title": "Exploring Latent Semantic Factors to Find Useful Product Reviews", "abstract": "Online reviews provided by consumers are a valuable asset for e-Commerce\nplatforms, influencing potential consumers in making purchasing decisions.\nHowever, these reviews are of varying quality, with the useful ones buried deep\nwithin a heap of non-informative reviews. In this work, we attempt to\nautomatically identify review quality in terms of its helpfulness to the end\nconsumers. In contrast to previous works in this domain exploiting a variety of\nsyntactic and community-level features, we delve deep into the semantics of\nreviews as to what makes them useful, providing interpretable explanation for\nthe same. We identify a set of consistency and semantic factors, all from the\ntext, ratings, and timestamps of user-generated reviews, making our approach\ngeneralizable across all communities and domains. We explore review semantics\nin terms of several latent factors like the expertise of its author, his\njudgment about the fine-grained facets of the underlying product, and his\nwriting style. These are cast into a Hidden Markov Model -- Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (HMM-LDA) based model to jointly infer: (i) reviewer expertise, (ii)\nitem facets, and (iii) review helpfulness.

{"title": "Item Recommendation with Evolving User Preferences and Experience", "abstract": "Current recommender systems exploit user and item similarities by\ncollaborative filtering. Some advanced methods also consider the temporal\nevolution of item ratings as a global background process. However, all prior\nmethods disregard the individual evolution of a user's experience level and how\nthis is expressed in the user's writing in a review community. In this paper,\nwe model the joint evolution of user experience, interest in specific item\nfacets, writing style, and rating behavior. This way we can generate individual\nrecommendations that take into account the user's maturity level (e.g.,\nrecommending art movies rather than blockbusters for a cinematography expert).\nAs only item ratings and review texts are observables, we capture the user's\nexperience and interests in a latent model learned from her reviews, vocabulary\nand writing style. We develop a generative HMM-LDA model to trace user\nevolution, where the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) traces her latent experience\nprogressing over time -- with solely user reviews and ratings as observables\nover time. The facets of a user's interest are drawn from a Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) model derived from her reviews, as a function of her (again\nlatent) experience level. In experiments with five real-world datasets, we show\nthat our model improves the rating prediction over state-of-the-art baselines,\nby a substantial margin. We also show, in a use-case study, that our model\nperforms well in the assessment of user experience levels.", "published": "2017-05-06 19:22:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02519v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.SI", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
