{"title": "On the relation between dependency distance, crossing dependencies, and\n  parsing. Comment on \"Dependency distance: a new perspective on syntactic\n  patterns in natural languages\" by Haitao Liu et al", "abstract": "Liu et al. (2017) provide a comprehensive account of research on dependency\ndistance in human languages. While the article is a very rich and useful report\non this complex subject, here I will expand on a few specific issues where\nresearch in computational linguistics (specifically natural language\nprocessing) can inform DDM research, and vice versa. These aspects have not\nbeen explored much in the article by Liu et al. or elsewhere, probably due to\nthe little overlap between both research communities, but they may provide\ninteresting insights for improving our understanding of the evolution of human\nlanguages, the mechanisms by which the brain processes and understands\nlanguage, and the construction of effective computer systems to achieve this\ngoal.", "published": "2017-05-27 16:19:37", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09837v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "68T50, 91F20, 97C30", "I.2.7; J.5; F.4.2"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
