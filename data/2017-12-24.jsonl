{"title": "Building a Sentiment Corpus of Tweets in Brazilian Portuguese", "abstract": "The large amount of data available in social media, forums and websites\nmotivates researches in several areas of Natural Language Processing, such as\nsentiment analysis. The popularity of the area due to its subjective and\nsemantic characteristics motivates research on novel methods and approaches for\nclassification. Hence, there is a high demand for datasets on different domains\nand different languages. This paper introduces TweetSentBR, a sentiment corpora\nfor Brazilian Portuguese manually annotated with 15.000 sentences on TV show\ndomain. The sentences were labeled in three classes (positive, neutral and\nnegative) by seven annotators, following literature guidelines for ensuring\nreliability on the annotation. We also ran baseline experiments on polarity\nclassification using three machine learning methods, reaching 80.99% on\nF-Measure and 82.06% on accuracy in binary classification, and 59.85% F-Measure\nand 64.62% on accuracy on three point classification.", "published": "2017-12-24 13:23:58", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08917v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Semi-automatic definite description annotation: a first report", "abstract": "Studies in Referring Expression Generation (REG) often make use of corpora of\ndefinite descriptions produced by human subjects in controlled experiments.\nExperiments of this kind, which are essential for the study of reference\nphenomena and many others, may however include a considerable amount of noise.\nHuman subjects may easily lack attention, or may simply misunderstand the task\nat hand and, as a result, the elicited data may include large proportions of\nambiguous or ill-formed descriptions. In addition to that, REG corpora are\nusually collected for the study of semantics-related phenomena, and it is often\nthe case that the elicited descriptions (and their input contexts) need to be\nannotated with their corresponding semantic properties. This, as in many other\nfields, may require considerable time and skilled annotators. As a means to\ntackle both kinds of difficulties - poor data quality and high annotation costs\n- this work discusses a semi-automatic method for the annotation of definite\ndescriptions produced by human subjects in REG data collection experiments. The\nmethod makes use of simple rules to establish associations between words and\nmeanings, and is intended to facilitate the design of experiments that produce\nREG corpora.", "published": "2017-12-24 14:54:22", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08933v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Neural Network Multitask Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting", "abstract": "Traditional neural network approaches for traffic flow forecasting are\nusually single task learning (STL) models, which do not take advantage of the\ninformation provided by related tasks. In contrast to STL, multitask learning\n(MTL) has the potential to improve generalization by transferring information\nin training signals of extra tasks. In this paper, MTL based neural networks\nare used for traffic flow forecasting. For neural network MTL, a\nbackpropagation (BP) network is constructed by incorporating traffic flows at\nseveral contiguous time instants into an output layer. Nodes in the output\nlayer can be seen as outputs of different but closely related STL tasks.\nComprehensive experiments on urban vehicular traffic flow data and comparisons\nwith STL show that MTL in BP neural networks is a promising and effective\napproach for traffic flow forecasting.", "published": "2017-12-24 00:27:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08862v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Comparative Opinion Mining: A Review", "abstract": "Opinion mining refers to the use of natural language processing, text\nanalysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective\ninformation in textual material. Opinion mining, also known as sentiment\nanalysis, has received a lot of attention in recent times, as it provides a\nnumber of tools to analyse the public opinion on a number of different topics.\nComparative opinion mining is a subfield of opinion mining that deals with\nidentifying and extracting information that is expressed in a comparative form\n(e.g.~\"paper X is better than the Y\"). Comparative opinion mining plays a very\nimportant role when ones tries to evaluate something, as it provides a\nreference point for the comparison. This paper provides a review of the area of\ncomparative opinion mining. It is the first review that cover specifically this\ntopic as all previous reviews dealt mostly with general opinion mining. This\nsurvey covers comparative opinion mining from two different angles. One from\nperspective of techniques and the other from perspective of comparative opinion\nelements. It also incorporates preprocessing tools as well as dataset that were\nused by the past researchers that can be useful to the future researchers in\nthe field of comparative opinion mining.", "published": "2017-12-24 16:16:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08941v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
