{"title": "Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Lexicon Method, Machine Learning Method and\n  Their Combination", "abstract": "This paper covers the two approaches for sentiment analysis: i) lexicon based\nmethod; ii) machine learning method. We describe several techniques to\nimplement these approaches and discuss how they can be adopted for sentiment\nclassification of Twitter messages. We present a comparative study of different\nlexicon combinations and show that enhancing sentiment lexicons with emoticons,\nabbreviations and social-media slang expressions increases the accuracy of\nlexicon-based classification for Twitter. We discuss the importance of feature\ngeneration and feature selection processes for machine learning sentiment\nclassification. To quantify the performance of the main sentiment analysis\nmethods over Twitter we run these algorithms on a benchmark Twitter dataset\nfrom the SemEval-2013 competition, task 2-B. The results show that machine\nlearning method based on SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers outperforms the\nlexicon method. We present a new ensemble method that uses a lexicon based\nsentiment score as input feature for the machine learning approach. The\ncombined method proved to produce more precise classifications. We also show\nthat employing a cost-sensitive classifier for highly unbalanced datasets\nyields an improvement of sentiment classification performance up to 7%.", "published": "2015-07-03 15:46:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00955v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG", "stat.ME", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
