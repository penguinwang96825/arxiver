{"title": "Large-volatility dynamics in financial markets", "abstract": "We investigate the large-volatility dynamics in financial markets, based on the minute-to-minute and daily data of the Chinese Indices and German DAX. The dynamic relaxation both before and after large volatilities is characterized by a power law, and the exponents $p_\\pm$ usually vary with the strength of the large volatilities. The large-volatility dynamics is time-reversal symmetric at the time scale in minutes, while asymmetric at the daily time scale. Careful analysis reveals that the time-reversal asymmetry is mainly induced by exogenous events. It is also the exogenous events which drive the financial dynamics to a non-stationary state. Different characteristics of the Chinese and German stock markets are uncovered.", "published": "2010-02-19 14:05:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3747v2", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
