{"title": "A Methodological Approach to Model CBR-based Systems", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in various areas to support system optimization and find solutions where the complexity makes it challenging to use algorithmic and heuristics. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is an AI technique intensively exploited in domains like management, medicine, design, construction, retail and smart grid. CBR is a technique for problem-solving and captures new knowledge by using past experiences. One of the main CBR deployment challenges is the target system modeling process. This paper presents a straightforward methodological approach to model CBR-based applications using the concepts of abstract and concrete models. Splitting the modeling process with two models facilitates the allocation of expertise between the application domain and the CBR technology. The methodological approach intends to facilitate the CBR modeling process and to foster CBR use in various areas outside computer science.", "published": "2020-09-09 15:09:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04346v1", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.NI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Multiple F0 Estimation in Vocal Ensembles using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper addresses the extraction of multiple F0 values from polyphonic and a cappella vocal performances using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We address the major challenges of ensemble singing, i.e., all melodic sources are vocals and singers sing in harmony. We build upon an existing architecture to produce a pitch salience function of the input signal, where the harmonic constant-Q transform (HCQT) and its associated phase differentials are used as an input representation. The pitch salience function is subsequently thresholded to obtain a multiple F0 estimation output. For training, we build a dataset that comprises several multi-track datasets of vocal quartets with F0 annotations. This work proposes and evaluates a set of CNNs for this task in diverse scenarios and data configurations, including recordings with additional reverb. Our models outperform a state-of-the-art method intended for the same music genre when evaluated with an increased F0 resolution, as well as a general-purpose method for multi-F0 estimation. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions.", "published": "2020-09-09 09:11:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04172v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.LG", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
