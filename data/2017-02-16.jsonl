{"title": "Fast and unsupervised methods for multilingual cognate clustering", "abstract": "In this paper we explore the use of unsupervised methods for detecting\ncognates in multilingual word lists. We use online EM to train sound segment\nsimilarity weights for computing similarity between two words. We tested our\nonline systems on geographically spread sixteen different language groups of\nthe world and show that the Online PMI system (Pointwise Mutual Information)\noutperforms a HMM based system and two linguistically motivated systems:\nLexStat and ALINE. Our results suggest that a PMI system trained in an online\nfashion can be used by historical linguists for fast and accurate\nidentification of cognates in not so well-studied language families.", "published": "2017-02-16 12:10:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04938v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Addressing the Data Sparsity Issue in Neural AMR Parsing", "abstract": "Neural attention models have achieved great success in different NLP tasks.\nHow- ever, they have not fulfilled their promise on the AMR parsing task due to\nthe data sparsity issue. In this paper, we de- scribe a sequence-to-sequence\nmodel for AMR parsing and present different ways to tackle the data sparsity\nproblem. We show that our methods achieve significant improvement over a\nbaseline neural atten- tion model and our results are also compet- itive\nagainst state-of-the-art systems that do not use extra linguistic resources.", "published": "2017-02-16 17:09:12", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05053v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
