{"title": "Spoken Language Translation for Polish", "abstract": "Spoken language translation (SLT) is becoming more important in the\nincreasingly globalized world, both from a social and economic point of view.\nIt is one of the major challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and\nmachine translation (MT), driving intense research activities in these areas.\nWhile past research in SLT, due to technology limitations, dealt mostly with\nspeech recorded under controlled conditions, today's major challenge is the\ntranslation of spoken language as it can be found in real life. Considered\napplication scenarios range from portable translators for tourists, lectures\nand presentations translation, to broadcast news and shows with live\ncaptioning. We would like to present PJIIT's experiences in the SLT gained from\nthe Eu-Bridge 7th framework project and the U-Star consortium activities for\nthe Polish/English language pair. Presented research concentrates on ASR\nadaptation for Polish (state-of-the-art acoustic models: DBN-BLSTM training,\nKaldi: LDA+MLLT+SAT+MMI), language modeling for ASR & MT (text normalization,\nRNN-based LMs, n-gram model domain interpolation) and statistical translation\ntechniques (hierarchical models, factored translation models, automatic casing\nand punctuation, comparable and bilingual corpora preparation). While results\nfor the well-defined domains (phrases for travelers, parliament speeches,\nmedical documentation, movie subtitling) are very encouraging, less defined\ndomains (presentation, lectures) still form a challenge. Our progress in the\nIWSLT TED task (MT only) will be presented, as well as current progress in the\nPolish ASR.", "published": "2015-11-24 16:28:16", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07788v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Natural Language Understanding with Distributed Representation", "abstract": "This is a lecture note for the course DS-GA 3001 <Natural Language\nUnderstanding with Distributed Representation> at the Center for Data Science ,\nNew York University in Fall, 2015. As the name of the course suggests, this\nlecture note introduces readers to a neural network based approach to natural\nlanguage understanding/processing. In order to make it as self-contained as\npossible, I spend much time on describing basics of machine learning and neural\nnetworks, only after which how they are used for natural languages is\nintroduced. On the language front, I almost solely focus on language modelling\nand machine translation, two of which I personally find most fascinating and\nmost fundamental to natural language understanding.", "published": "2015-11-24 23:23:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07916v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Fine-Grain Annotation of Cricket Videos", "abstract": "The recognition of human activities is one of the key problems in video\nunderstanding. Action recognition is challenging even for specific categories\nof videos, such as sports, that contain only a small set of actions.\nInterestingly, sports videos are accompanied by detailed commentaries available\nonline, which could be used to perform action annotation in a weakly-supervised\nsetting. For the specific case of Cricket videos, we address the challenge of\ntemporal segmentation and annotation of ctions with semantic descriptions. Our\nsolution consists of two stages. In the first stage, the video is segmented\ninto \"scenes\", by utilizing the scene category information extracted from\ntext-commentary. The second stage consists of classifying video-shots as well\nas the phrases in the textual description into various categories. The relevant\nphrases are then suitably mapped to the video-shots. The novel aspect of this\nwork is the fine temporal scale at which semantic information is assigned to\nthe video. As a result of our approach, we enable retrieval of specific actions\nthat last only a few seconds, from several hours of video. This solution yields\na large number of labeled exemplars, with no manual effort, that could be used\nby machine learning algorithms to learn complex actions.", "published": "2015-11-24 08:34:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07607v2", "categories": ["cs.MM", "cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "primary_category": "cs.MM"}
