{"title": "MTRGL:Effective Temporal Correlation Discerning through Multi-modal Temporal Relational Graph Learning", "abstract": "In this study, we explore the synergy of deep learning and financial market applications, focusing on pair trading. This market-neutral strategy is integral to quantitative finance and is apt for advanced deep-learning techniques. A pivotal challenge in pair trading is discerning temporal correlations among entities, necessitating the integration of diverse data modalities. Addressing this, we introduce a novel framework, Multi-modal Temporal Relation Graph Learning (MTRGL). MTRGL combines time series data and discrete features into a temporal graph and employs a memory-based temporal graph neural network. This approach reframes temporal correlation identification as a temporal graph link prediction task, which has shown empirical success. Our experiments on real-world datasets confirm the superior performance of MTRGL, emphasizing its promise in refining automated pair trading strategies.", "published": "2024-01-25 14:21:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14199v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "econ.GN", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
