{"title": "Concept-based indexing in text information retrieval", "abstract": "Traditional information retrieval systems rely on keywords to index documents\nand queries. In such systems, documents are retrieved based on the number of\nshared keywords with the query. This lexical-focused retrieval leads to\ninaccurate and incomplete results when different keywords are used to describe\nthe documents and queries. Semantic-focused retrieval approaches attempt to\novercome this problem by relying on concepts rather than on keywords to\nindexing and retrieval. The goal is to retrieve documents that are semantically\nrelevant to a given user query. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a\nsolution at the indexing level. More precisely, we propose a novel approach for\nsemantic indexing based on concepts identified from a linguistic resource. In\nparticular, our approach relies on the joint use of WordNet and WordNetDomains\nlexical databases for concept identification. Furthermore, we propose a\nsemantic-based concept weighting scheme that relies on a novel definition of\nconcept centrality. The resulting system is evaluated on the TIME test\ncollection. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposition over\ntraditional IR approaches.", "published": "2013-03-07 14:46:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1703v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Efficient learning strategy of Chinese characters based on network\n  approach", "abstract": "Based on network analysis of hierarchical structural relations among Chinese\ncharacters, we develop an efficient learning strategy of Chinese characters. We\nregard a more efficient learning method if one learns the same number of useful\nChinese characters in less effort or time. We construct a node-weighted network\nof Chinese characters, where character usage frequencies are used as node\nweights. Using this hierarchical node-weighted network, we propose a new\nlearning method, the distributed node weight (DNW) strategy, which is based on\na new measure of nodes' importance that takes into account both the weight of\nthe nodes and the hierarchical structure of the network. Chinese character\nlearning strategies, particularly their learning order, are analyzed as\ndynamical processes over the network. We compare the efficiency of three\ntheoretical learning methods and two commonly used methods from mainstream\nChinese textbooks, one for Chinese elementary school students and the other for\nstudents learning Chinese as a second language. We find that the DNW method\nsignificantly outperforms the others, implying that the efficiency of current\nlearning methods of major textbooks can be greatly improved.", "published": "2013-03-07 03:19:34", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1599v1", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
