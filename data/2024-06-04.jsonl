{"title": "Mean field equilibrium asset pricing model with habit formation", "abstract": "This paper presents an asset pricing model in an incomplete market involving\na large number of heterogeneous agents based on the mean field game theory. In\nthe model, we incorporate habit formation in consumption preferences, which has\nbeen widely used to explain various phenomena in financial economics. In order\nto characterize the market-clearing equilibrium, we derive a quadratic-growth\nmean field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) and study its\nwell-posedness and asymptotic behavior in the large population limit.\nAdditionally, we introduce an exponential quadratic Gaussian reformulation of\nthe asset pricing model, in which the solution is obtained in a semi-analytic\nform.", "published": "2024-06-04 09:44:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02155v2", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.PR", "q-fin.TR", "49N80, 91B51, 60H10"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
