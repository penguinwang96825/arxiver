{"title": "OmniGraph: Rich Representation and Graph Kernel Learning", "abstract": "OmniGraph, a novel representation to support a range of NLP classification\ntasks, integrates lexical items, syntactic dependencies and frame semantic\nparses into graphs. Feature engineering is folded into the learning through\nconvolution graph kernel learning to explore different extents of the graph. A\nhigh-dimensional space of features includes individual nodes as well as complex\nsubgraphs. In experiments on a text-forecasting problem that predicts stock\nprice change from news for company mentions, OmniGraph beats several benchmarks\nbased on bag-of-words, syntactic dependencies, and semantic trees. The highly\nexpressive features OmniGraph discovers provide insights into the semantics\nacross distinct market sectors. To demonstrate the method's generality, we also\nreport its high performance results on a fine-grained sentiment corpus.", "published": "2015-10-10 21:22:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02983v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
