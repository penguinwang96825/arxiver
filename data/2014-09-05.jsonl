{"title": "Structure of a media co-occurrence network", "abstract": "Social networks have been of much interest in recent years. We here focus on\na network structure derived from co-occurrences of people in traditional\nnewspaper media. We find three clear deviations from what can be expected in a\nrandom graph. First, the average degree in the empirical network is much lower\nthan expected, and the average weight of a link much higher than expected.\nSecondly, high degree nodes attract disproportionately much weight. Thirdly,\nrelatively much of the weight seems to concentrate between high degree nodes.\nWe believe this can be explained by the fact that most people tend to co-occur\nrepeatedly with the same people. We create a model that replicates these\nobservations qualitatively based on two self-reinforcing processes: (1) more\nfrequently occurring persons are more likely to occur again; and (2) if two\npeople co-occur frequently, they are more likely to co-occur again. This\nsuggest that the media tends to focus on people that are already in the news,\nand that they reinforce existing co-occurrences.", "published": "2014-09-05 11:42:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1744v2", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph"}
