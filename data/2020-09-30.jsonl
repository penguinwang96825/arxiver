{"title": "Toolpath design for additive manufacturing using deep reinforcement learning", "abstract": "Toolpath optimization of metal-based additive manufacturing processes is currently hampered by the high-dimensionality of its design space. In this work, a reinforcement learning platform is proposed that dynamically learns toolpath strategies to build an arbitrary part. To this end, three prominent model-free reinforcement learning formulations are investigated to design additive manufacturing toolpaths and demonstrated for two cases of dense and sparse reward structures. The results indicate that this learning-based toolpath design approach achieves high scores, especially when a dense reward structure is present.", "published": "2020-09-30 01:03:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14365v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Analyzing the Capacity of Distributed Vector Representations to Encode Spatial Information", "abstract": "Vector Symbolic Architectures belong to a family of related cognitive modeling approaches that encode symbols and structures in high-dimensional vectors. Similar to human subjects, whose capacity to process and store information or concepts in short-term memory is subject to numerical restrictions,the capacity of information that can be encoded in such vector representations is limited and one way of modeling the numerical restrictions to cognition. In this paper, we analyze these limits regarding information capacity of distributed representations. We focus our analysis on simple superposition and more complex, structured representations involving convolutive powers to encode spatial information. In two experiments, we find upper bounds for the number of concepts that can effectively be stored in a single vector.", "published": "2020-09-30 18:49:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00055v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

{"title": "Where Does Trust Break Down? A Quantitative Trust Analysis of Deep Neural Networks via Trust Matrix and Conditional Trust Densities", "abstract": "The advances and successes in deep learning in recent years have led to considerable efforts and investments into its widespread ubiquitous adoption for a wide variety of applications, ranging from personal assistants and intelligent navigation to search and product recommendation in e-commerce. With this tremendous rise in deep learning adoption comes questions about the trustworthiness of the deep neural networks that power these applications. Motivated to answer such questions, there has been a very recent interest in trust quantification. In this work, we introduce the concept of trust matrix, a novel trust quantification strategy that leverages the recently introduced question-answer trust metric by Wong et al. to provide deeper, more detailed insights into where trust breaks down for a given deep neural network given a set of questions. More specifically, a trust matrix defines the expected question-answer trust for a given actor-oracle answer scenario, allowing one to quickly spot areas of low trust that needs to be addressed to improve the trustworthiness of a deep neural network. The proposed trust matrix is simple to calculate, humanly interpretable, and to the best of the authors' knowledge is the first to study trust at the actor-oracle answer level. We further extend the concept of trust densities with the notion of conditional trust densities. We experimentally leverage trust matrices to study several well-known deep neural network architectures for image recognition, and further study the trust density and conditional trust densities for an interesting actor-oracle answer scenario. The results illustrate that trust matrices, along with conditional trust densities, can be useful tools in addition to the existing suite of trust quantification metrics for guiding practitioners and regulators in creating and certifying deep learning solutions for trusted operation.", "published": "2020-09-30 14:33:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14701v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "On Detecting Spoofing Strategies in High Frequency Trading", "abstract": "Spoofing is an illegal act of artificially modifying the supply to drive temporarily prices in a given direction for profit. In practice, detection of such an act is challenging due to the complexity of modern electronic platforms and the high frequency at which orders are channeled. We present a micro-structural study of spoofing in a simple static setting. A multilevel imbalance which influences the resulting price movement is introduced upon which we describe the optimization strategy of a potential spoofer. We provide conditions under which a market is more likely to admit spoofing behavior as a function of the characteristics of the market. We describe the optimal spoofing strategy after optimization which allows us to quantify the resulting impact on the imbalance after spoofing. Based on these results we calibrate the model to real Level 2 datasets from TMX, and provide some monitoring procedures based on the Wasserstein distance to detect spoofing strategies in real time.", "published": "2020-09-30 17:48:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14818v2", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Event-Independent Network for Polyphonic Sound Event Localization and Detection", "abstract": "Polyphonic sound event localization and detection is not only detecting what sound events are happening but localizing corresponding sound sources. This series of tasks was first introduced in DCASE 2019 Task 3. In 2020, the sound event localization and detection task introduces additional challenges in moving sound sources and overlapping-event cases, which include two events of the same type with two different direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles. In this paper, a novel event-independent network for polyphonic sound event localization and detection is proposed. Unlike the two-stage method we proposed in DCASE 2019 Task 3, this new network is fully end-to-end. Inputs to the network are first-order Ambisonics (FOA) time-domain signals, which are then fed into a 1-D convolutional layer to extract acoustic features. The network is then split into two parallel branches. The first branch is for sound event detection (SED), and the second branch is for DoA estimation. There are three types of predictions from the network, SED predictions, DoA predictions, and event activity detection (EAD) predictions that are used to combine the SED and DoA features for on-set and off-set estimation. All of these predictions have the format of two tracks indicating that there are at most two overlapping events. Within each track, there could be at most one event happening. This architecture introduces a problem of track permutation. To address this problem, a frame-level permutation invariant training method is used. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect polyphonic sound events and their corresponding DoAs. Its performance on the Task 3 dataset is greatly increased as compared with that of the baseline method.", "published": "2020-09-30 23:01:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00140v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
