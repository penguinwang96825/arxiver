{"title": "SSP: Semantic Space Projection for Knowledge Graph Embedding with Text\n  Descriptions", "abstract": "Knowledge representation is an important, long-history topic in AI, and there\nhave been a large amount of work for knowledge graph embedding which projects\nsymbolic entities and relations into low-dimensional, real-valued vector space.\nHowever, most embedding methods merely concentrate on data fitting and ignore\nthe explicit semantic expression, leading to uninterpretable representations.\nThus, traditional embedding methods have limited potentials for many\napplications such as question answering, and entity classification. To this\nend, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph\n\\textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that\nglobally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in\neach aspect for every triple. Since both aspects and categories are\nsemantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as\nthe semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments justify our\nmodel outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.", "published": "2016-04-17 07:15:33", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04835v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
