{"title": "Market information of the fractional stochastic regularity model", "abstract": "The Fractional Stochastic Regularity Model (FSRM) is an extension of\nBlack-Scholes model describing the multifractal nature of prices. It is based\non a multifractional process with a random Hurst exponent $H_t$, driven by a\nfractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. When the regularity parameter\n$H_t$ is equal to $1/2$, the efficient market hypothesis holds, but when\n$H_t\\neq 1/2$ past price returns contain some information on a future trend or\nmean-reversion of the log-price process. In this paper, we investigate some\nproperties of the fOU process and, thanks to information theory and Shannon's\nentropy, we determine theoretically the serial information of the regularity\nprocess $H_t$ of the FSRM, giving some insight into one's ability to forecast\nfuture price increments and to build statistical arbitrages with this model.", "published": "2024-09-11 10:14:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07159v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "q-fin.ST"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
