{"title": "A Deep Learning Approach to Data-driven Parameterizations for\n  Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis", "abstract": "Nearly all Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesizers today use Mel Cepstral\ncoefficients as the vocal tract parameterization of the speech signal. Mel\nCepstral coefficients were never intended to work in a parametric speech\nsynthesis framework, but as yet, there has been little success in creating a\nbetter parameterization that is more suited to synthesis. In this paper, we use\ndeep learning algorithms to investigate a data-driven parameterization\ntechnique that is designed for the specific requirements of synthesis. We\ncreate an invertible, low-dimensional, noise-robust encoding of the Mel Log\nSpectrum by training a tapered Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). This SDA is\nthen unwrapped and used as the initialization for a Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP). The MLP is fine-tuned by training it to reconstruct the input at the\noutput layer. This MLP is then split down the middle to form encoding and\ndecoding networks. These networks produce a parameterization of the Mel Log\nSpectrum that is intended to better fulfill the requirements of synthesis.\nResults are reported for experiments conducted using this resulting\nparameterization with the ClusterGen speech synthesizer.", "published": "2014-09-30 14:20:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8558v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An agent-driven semantical identifier using radial basis neural networks\n  and reinforcement learning", "abstract": "Due to the huge availability of documents in digital form, and the deception\npossibility raise bound to the essence of digital documents and the way they\nare spread, the authorship attribution problem has constantly increased its\nrelevance. Nowadays, authorship attribution,for both information retrieval and\nanalysis, has gained great importance in the context of security, trust and\ncopyright preservation. This work proposes an innovative multi-agent driven\nmachine learning technique that has been developed for authorship attribution.\nBy means of a preprocessing for word-grouping and time-period related analysis\nof the common lexicon, we determine a bias reference level for the recurrence\nfrequency of the words within analysed texts, and then train a Radial Basis\nNeural Networks (RBPNN)-based classifier to identify the correct author. The\nmain advantage of the proposed approach lies in the generality of the semantic\nanalysis, which can be applied to different contexts and lexical domains,\nwithout requiring any modification. Moreover, the proposed system is able to\nincorporate an external input, meant to tune the classifier, and then\nself-adjust by means of continuous learning reinforcement.", "published": "2014-09-30 11:10:23", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8484v1", "categories": ["cs.NE", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.MA", "68T01, 68T05, 68T10, 68T50, 68U15", "C.2.1; I.2.6; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.NE"}
