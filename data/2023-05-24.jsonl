{"title": "Automated Market Making and Arbitrage Profits in the Presence of Fees", "abstract": "We consider the impact of trading fees on the profits of arbitrageurs trading against an automated marker marker (AMM) or, equivalently, on the adverse selection incurred by liquidity providers due to arbitrage. We extend the model of Milionis et al. [2022] for a general class of two asset AMMs to both introduce fees and discrete Poisson block generation times. In our setting, we are able to compute the expected instantaneous rate of arbitrage profit in closed form. When the fees are low, in the fast block asymptotic regime, the impact of fees takes a particularly simple form: fees simply scale down arbitrage profits by the fraction of time that an arriving arbitrageur finds a profitable trade.", "published": "2023-05-24 00:59:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14604v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "math.OC", "q-fin.PM", "q-fin.PR", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
