{"title": "The Complexity of Blocking All Solutions", "abstract": "We consider the general problem of blocking all solutions of some given\ncombinatorial problem with only few elements. For example, the problem of\ndestroying all maximum cliques of a given graph by forbidding only few\nvertices. Problems of this kind are so fundamental that they have been studied\nunder many different names in many different disjoint research communities\nalready since the 90s. Depending on the context, they have been called the\ninterdiction, most vital vertex, most vital edge, blocker, or vertex deletion\nproblem. Despite their apparent popularity, surprisingly little is known about\nthe computational complexity of interdiction problems in the case where the\noriginal problem is already NP-complete. In this paper, we fill that gap of\nknowledge by showing that a large amount of interdiction problems are even\nharder than NP-hard. Namely, they are complete for the second stage of\nStockmeyer's polynomial hierarchy, the complexity class $\\Sigma^p_2$. Such\ncomplexity insights are important because they imply that all these problems\ncan not be modelled by a compact integer program (unless the unlikely\nconjecture NP $= \\Sigma_2^p$ holds). Concretely, we prove\n$\\Sigma^p_2$-completeness of the following interdiction problems:\nsatisfiability, 3satisfiability, dominating set, set cover, hitting set,\nfeedback vertex set, feedback arc set, uncapacitated facility location,\n$p$-center, $p$-median, independent set, clique, subset sum, knapsack,\nHamiltonian path/cycle (directed/undirected), TSP, $k$ directed vertex disjoint\npath ($k \\geq 2$), Steiner tree. We show that all of these problems share an\nabstract property which implies that their interdiction counterpart is\n$\\Sigma_2^p$-complete. Thus, all of these problems are $\\Sigma_2^p$-complete\n\\enquote{for the same reason}. Our result extends a recent framework by Gr\\\"une\nand Wulf.", "published": "2025-02-07 21:38:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05348v1", "categories": ["cs.CC", "cs.DM", "math.OC", "F.2.2"], "primary_category": "cs.CC"}
{"title": "Induced Disjoint Paths Without an Induced Minor", "abstract": "We exhibit a new obstacle to the nascent algorithmic theory for classes\nexcluding an induced minor. We indeed show that on the class of string graphs\n-- which avoids the 1-subdivision of, say, $K_5$ as an induced minor -- Induced\n2-Disjoint Paths is NP-complete. So, while $k$-Disjoint Paths, for a fixed $k$,\nis polynomial-time solvable in general graphs, the absence of a graph as an\ninduced minor does not make its induced variant tractable, even for $k=2$. This\nanswers a question of Korhonen and Lokshtanov [SODA '24], and complements a\npolynomial-time algorithm for Induced $k$-Disjoint Paths in classes of bounded\ngenus by Kobayashi and Kawarabayashi [SODA '09]. In addition to being string\ngraphs, our produced hard instances are subgraphs of a constant power of\nbounded-degree planar graphs, hence have bounded twin-width and bounded maximum\ndegree.\n  We also leverage our new result to show that there is a fixed subcubic graph\n$H$ such that deciding if an input graph contains $H$ as an induced subdivision\nis NP-complete. Until now, all the graphs $H$ for which such a statement was\nknown had a vertex of degree at least 4. This answers a question by Chudnovsky,\nSeymour, and the fourth author [JCTB '13], and by Le [JGT '19]. Finally we\nresolve another question of Korhonen and Lokshtanov by exhibiting a subcubic\ngraph $H$ without two adjacent degree-3 vertices and such that deciding if an\ninput $n$-vertex graph contains $H$ as an induced minor is NP-complete, and\nunless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails, requires time $2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt\nn)}$. This complements an algorithm running in subexponential time\n$2^{O(n^{2/3} \\log n)}$ by these authors [SODA '24] under the same technical\ncondition.", "published": "2025-02-07 19:45:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05289v1", "categories": ["cs.CC", "cs.DM", "math.CO", "68Q25", "F.2.2"], "primary_category": "cs.CC"}
{"title": "A Randomised Approach to Distributed Sorting", "abstract": "We introduce and analyse a new, extremely simple, randomised sorting\nalgorithm:\n  - choose a pair of indices $\\{i, j\\}$ according to some distribution $q$;\n  - sort the elements in positions $i$ and $j$ of the array in ascending order.\n  Choosing $q_{\\{i,j\\}} \\propto 1/|j - i|$ yields an order-$n (\\log n)^2$\nsorting time. We call it the harmonic sorter.\n  The sorter trivially parallelises in the asynchronous setting, yielding a\nlinear speed-up.

{"title": "Robust valuation and optimal harvesting of forestry resources in the presence of catastrophe risk and parameter uncertainty", "abstract": "We determine forest lease value and optimal harvesting strategies under model\nparameter uncertainty within stochastic bio-economic models that account for\ncatastrophe risk. Catastrophic events are modeled as a Poisson point process,\nwith a two-factor stochastic convenience yield model capturing the lumber spot\nprice dynamics. Using lumber futures and US wildfire data, we estimate model\nparameters through a Kalman filter and maximum likelihood estimation and define\nthe model parameter uncertainty set as the 95% confidence region. We\nnumerically determine the forest lease value under catastrophe risk and\nparameter uncertainty using reflected backward stochastic differential\nequations (RBSDEs) and establish conservative and optimistic bounds for lease\nvalues and optimal stopping boundaries for harvesting, facilitating Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Numerical experiments further explore how parameter uncertainty,\ncatastrophe intensity, and carbon sequestration impact the lease valuation and\nharvesting decision. In particular, we explore the costs arising from this form\nof uncertainty in the form of a reduction of the lease value. These are\nimplicit costs that can be attributed to climate risk and will be emphasized\nthrough the importance of forestry resources in the energy transition process.\nWe conclude that in the presence of parameter uncertainty, it is better to lean\ntoward a conservative strategy reflecting, to some extent, the worst case than\nbeing overly optimistic. Our results also highlight the critical role of\nconvenience yield in determining optimal harvesting strategies.", "published": "2025-02-07 21:24:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05340v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
