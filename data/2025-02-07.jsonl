{"title": "Robust valuation and optimal harvesting of forestry resources in the presence of catastrophe risk and parameter uncertainty", "abstract": "We determine forest lease value and optimal harvesting strategies under model\nparameter uncertainty within stochastic bio-economic models that account for\ncatastrophe risk. Catastrophic events are modeled as a Poisson point process,\nwith a two-factor stochastic convenience yield model capturing the lumber spot\nprice dynamics. Using lumber futures and US wildfire data, we estimate model\nparameters through a Kalman filter and maximum likelihood estimation and define\nthe model parameter uncertainty set as the 95% confidence region. We\nnumerically determine the forest lease value under catastrophe risk and\nparameter uncertainty using reflected backward stochastic differential\nequations (RBSDEs) and establish conservative and optimistic bounds for lease\nvalues and optimal stopping boundaries for harvesting, facilitating Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Numerical experiments further explore how parameter uncertainty,\ncatastrophe intensity, and carbon sequestration impact the lease valuation and\nharvesting decision. In particular, we explore the costs arising from this form\nof uncertainty in the form of a reduction of the lease value. These are\nimplicit costs that can be attributed to climate risk and will be emphasized\nthrough the importance of forestry resources in the energy transition process.\nWe conclude that in the presence of parameter uncertainty, it is better to lean\ntoward a conservative strategy reflecting, to some extent, the worst case than\nbeing overly optimistic. Our results also highlight the critical role of\nconvenience yield in determining optimal harvesting strategies.", "published": "2025-02-07 21:24:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05340v1", "categories": ["q-fin.MF", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "q-fin.MF"}
