Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism.

Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local\nquality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for\nenhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.\nTo achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison\nNetwork (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and\nitem-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in\ntraditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features\nwhich describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture\nthe local quality of routes.

CCB includes a\nComprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can\nupdate the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive\ncomparison.

However, building a unified\nspeech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:\n(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,\nextending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data\nfor fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information\nat different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,\nwhile understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to\ndifficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these\nchallenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization\nand speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an\nUnderstanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level\nsemantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text\nLLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which\nreduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech\nLLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that\nconcurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a\nunified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and\ngeneration capabilities.

Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance.

{"title": "Scalable, Technology-Agnostic Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance for Point Machine using Deep Learning", "abstract": "The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches\ntrain routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical\nsafety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service\ndisruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary\ninterruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work\nrelies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.\nThis not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,\nbut it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and\noperational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance\nrecords, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source\nissues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern\nof PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM\nmovement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only\none input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to\nclassify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving\n>99.99\\% precision, <0.01\\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our\nmethodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on\nseveral electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench\nenvironments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a\nclear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence\nlayer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359\nstandard.", "published": "2025-08-12 13:15:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11692v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.AI", "68T07, 68T05", "I.2.6; I.5.1; I.5.4"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Towards Generalizable Learning Models for EEG-Based Identification of Pain Perception", "abstract": "EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals\nhow the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious\nstimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of\nmachine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant\nvariability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain\nperception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically\nevaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of\nmodels, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for\nidentifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory\nstimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from\n108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and\ncross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional\nmodels suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance,\nwhile deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential\nfor subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability\nremained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its\npotential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other\nhand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a\nstandardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same\ngeneralization constraints.", "published": "2025-08-12 09:57:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11691v1", "categories": ["eess.SP", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
{"title": "Kernel Two-Sample Testing via Directional Components Analysis", "abstract": "We propose a novel kernel-based two-sample test that leverages the spectral\ndecomposition of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to identify and\nutilize well-estimated directional components in reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace (RKHS). Our approach is motivated by the observation that the estimation\nquality of these components varies significantly, with leading eigen-directions\nbeing more reliably estimated in finite samples. By focusing on these\ndirections and aggregating information across multiple kernels, the proposed\ntest achieves higher power and improved robustness, especially in\nhigh-dimensional and unbalanced sample settings. We further develop a\ncomputationally efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating\ncritical values, which is theoretically justified and significantly faster than\npermutation-based alternatives. Extensive simulations and empirical studies on\nmicroarray datasets demonstrate that our method maintains the nominal Type I\nerror rate and delivers superior power compared to other existing MMD-based\ntests.", "published": "2025-08-12 02:04:55", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08564v2", "categories": ["stat.ME", "math.ST", "stat.ML", "stat.TH"], "primary_category": "stat.ME"}

{"title": "Optimum 1-Step Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Reed-Muller Codes", "abstract": "The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes\nRM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding\nmessage symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding\nalgorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or\nat the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some\ncombinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that\nis, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without\nsequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r\nand m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new\nhard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains\nthis error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a\nparallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols\nsimultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the\nerasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to\nd_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first\n1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and\nthe maximum one-step error correction capability.", "published": "2025-08-12 08:28:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08736v2", "categories": ["cs.IT", "math.CO", "math.IT"], "primary_category": "cs.IT"}

While several estimators of these divergences have been\nproposed in the literature with their consistency properties established and\nminimax convergence rates quantified, existing accounts of probabilistic bounds\ngoverning the estimation error are relatively underdeveloped. Here, we make\nprogress in this regard by establishing exponential deviation inequalities for\nsmoothed plug-in estimators and neural estimators by relating the error to an\nappropriate empirical process and leveraging tools from empirical process\ntheory. In particular, our approach does not require the underlying\ndistributions to be compactly supported or have densities bounded away from\nzero, an assumption prevalent in existing results. The deviation inequality\nalso leads to a one-sided concentration bound from the expectation, which is\nuseful in random-coding arguments over continuous alphabets in information\ntheory with potential applications to physical-layer security.

Following the work of Modigliani\nand Miller, it has become a vital part of discussions related to the study of\nfinancial networks and predictions.

Whenever the micro and\nmacroeconomic factors change, there is a high probability of information\nasymmetry in the market, and this asymmetry of information creates turbulence\nin the market. The analysis and interpretation of turbulence caused by the\ndifferences in information is crucial in understanding the nature of the stock\nmarket using price patterns and fluctuations.
