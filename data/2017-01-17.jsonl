{"title": "Community Question Answering Platforms vs. Twitter for Predicting\n  Characteristics of Urban Neighbourhoods", "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate whether text from a Community Question\nAnswering (QA) platform can be used to predict and describe real-world\nattributes. We experiment with predicting a wide range of 62 demographic\nattributes for neighbourhoods of London. We use the text from QA platform of\nYahoo! Answers and compare our results to the ones obtained from Twitter\nmicroblogs. Outcomes show that the correlation between the predicted\ndemographic attributes using text from Yahoo! Answers discussions and the\nobserved demographic attributes can reach an average Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of \\r{ho} = 0.54, slightly higher than the predictions obtained\nusing Twitter data. Our qualitative analysis indicates that there is semantic\nrelatedness between the highest correlated terms extracted from both datasets\nand their relative demographic attributes. Furthermore, the correlations\nhighlight the different natures of the information contained in Yahoo! Answers\nand Twitter. While the former seems to offer a more encyclopedic content, the\nlatter provides information related to the current sociocultural aspects or\nphenomena.", "published": "2017-01-17 12:53:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04653v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.SI"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
