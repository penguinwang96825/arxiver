{"title": "Language Modeling with Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been promising in the field of\nimage generation, however, they have been hard to train for language\ngeneration. GANs were originally designed to output differentiable values, so\ndiscrete language generation is challenging for them which causes high levels\nof instability in training GANs. Consequently, past work has resorted to\npre-training with maximum-likelihood or training GANs without pre-training with\na WGAN objective with a gradient penalty. In this study, we present a\ncomparison of those approaches. Furthermore, we present the results of some\nexperiments that indicate better training and convergence of Wasserstein GANs\n(WGANs) when a weaker regularization term is enforcing the Lipschitz\nconstraint.", "published": "2018-04-08 03:18:13", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02617v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}

Especially, the agent system recommends the sightseeing\nspot and local hospitality corresponding to the current feelings. The system\nsuch as concierge can estimate user's emotion and mood by Emotion Generating\nCalculations and Mental State Transition Network. In this paper, the system\ndecides the next candidates for spots and foods by the reasoning of fuzzy Petri\nNet in order to make more smooth communication between human and smartphone.\nThe system was developed for Hiroshima Tourist Information and described some\nhospitality about the concierge system.", "published": "2018-04-08 09:18:56", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02657v1", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.HC"}
{"title": "Environmental Sound Recognition using Masked Conditional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Neural network based architectures used for sound recognition are usually\nadapted from other application domains, which may not harness sound related\nproperties. The ConditionaL Neural Network (CLNN) is designed to consider the\nrelational properties across frames in a temporal signal, and its extension the\nMasked ConditionaL Neural Network (MCLNN) embeds a filterbank behavior within\nthe network, which enforces the network to learn in frequency bands rather than\nbins. Additionally, it automates the exploration of different feature\ncombinations analogous to handcrafting the optimum combination of features for\na recognition task. We applied the MCLNN to the environmental sounds of the\nESC-10 dataset. The MCLNN achieved competitive accuracies compared to\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and hand-crafted attempts.", "published": "2018-04-08 10:22:02", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02665v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.SD", "eess.AS", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
