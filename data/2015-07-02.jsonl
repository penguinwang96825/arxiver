{"title": "Simple, Fast Semantic Parsing with a Tensor Kernel", "abstract": "We describe a simple approach to semantic parsing based on a tensor product\nkernel. We extract two feature vectors: one for the query and one for each\ncandidate logical form. We then train a classifier using the tensor product of\nthe two vectors. Using very simple features for both, our system achieves an\naverage F1 score of 40.1% on the WebQuestions dataset. This is comparable to\nmore complex systems but is simpler to implement and runs faster.", "published": "2015-07-02 15:58:25", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00639v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
