{"title": "Finding the maximum-a-posteriori behaviour of agents in an agent-based model", "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of finding the most probable set of events that could have led to a set of partial, noisy observations of some dynamical system. In particular, we consider the case of a dynamical system that is a (possibly stochastic) time-stepping agent-based model with a discrete state space, the (possibly noisy) observations are the number of agents that have some given property and the events we're interested in are the decisions made by the agents (their ``expressed behaviours'') as the model evolves.\n  We show that this problem can be reduced to an integer linear programming problem which can subsequently be solved numerically using a standard branch-and-cut algorithm. We describe two implementations, an ``offline'' algorithm that finds the maximum-a-posteriori expressed behaviours given a set of observations over a finite time window, and an ``online'' algorithm that incrementally builds a feasible set of behaviours from a stream of observations that may have no natural beginning or end.\n  We demonstrate both algorithms on a spatial predator-prey model on a 32x32 grid with an initial population of 100 agents.", "published": "2020-05-05 12:16:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02096v1", "categories": ["cs.MA"], "primary_category": "cs.MA"}
{"title": "Long short-term memory networks and laglasso for bond yield forecasting: Peeping inside the black box", "abstract": "Modern decision-making in fixed income asset management benefits from intelligent systems, which involve the use of state-of-the-art machine learning models and appropriate methodologies. We conduct the first study of bond yield forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, validating its potential and identifying its memory advantage. Specifically, we model the 10-year bond yield using univariate LSTMs with three input sequences and five forecasting horizons. We compare those with multilayer perceptrons (MLP), univariate and with the most relevant features. To demystify the notion of black box associated with LSTMs, we conduct the first internal study of the model. To this end, we calculate the LSTM signals through time, at selected locations in the memory cell, using sequence-to-sequence architectures, uni and multivariate. We then proceed to explain the states' signals using exogenous information, for what we develop the LSTM-LagLasso methodology. The results show that the univariate LSTM model with additional memory is capable of achieving similar results as the multivariate MLP using macroeconomic and market information. Furthermore, shorter forecasting horizons require smaller input sequences and vice-versa. The most remarkable property found consistently in the LSTM signals, is the activation/deactivation of units through time, and the specialisation of units by yield range or feature. Those signals are complex but can be explained by exogenous variables. Additionally, some of the relevant features identified via LSTM-LagLasso are not commonly used in forecasting models. In conclusion, our work validates the potential of LSTMs and methodologies for bonds, providing additional tools for financial practitioners.", "published": "2020-05-05 14:23:00", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02217v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP", "cs.CE", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
