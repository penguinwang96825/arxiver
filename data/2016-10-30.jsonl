{"title": "Represent, Aggregate, and Constrain: A Novel Architecture for Machine\n  Reading from Noisy Sources", "abstract": "In order to extract event information from text, a machine reading model must\nlearn to accurately read and interpret the ways in which that information is\nexpressed. But it must also, as the human reader must, aggregate numerous\nindividual value hypotheses into a single coherent global analysis, applying\nglobal constraints which reflect prior knowledge of the domain.\n  In this work we focus on the task of extracting plane crash event information\nfrom clusters of related news articles whose labels are derived via distant\nsupervision. Unlike previous machine reading work, we assume that while most\ntarget values will occur frequently in most clusters, they may also be missing\nor incorrect.\n  We introduce a novel neural architecture to explicitly model the noisy nature\nof the data and to deal with these aforementioned learning issues. Our models\nare trained end-to-end and achieve an improvement of more than 12.1 F$_1$ over\nprevious work, despite using far less linguistic annotation. We apply factor\ngraph constraints to promote more coherent event analyses, with belief\npropagation inference formulated within the transitions of a recurrent neural\nnetwork. We show this technique additionally improves maximum F$_1$ by up to\n2.8 points, resulting in a relative improvement of $50\\%$ over the previous\nstate-of-the-art.", "published": "2016-10-30 22:33:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09722v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Feature-Augmented Neural Networks for Patient Note De-identification", "abstract": "Patient notes contain a wealth of information of potentially great interest\nto medical investigators. However, to protect patients' privacy, Protected\nHealth Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they can\nbe legally released, a process known as patient note de-identification. The\nmain objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possible\nrecall. Recently, the first neural-network-based de-identification system has\nbeen proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it does\nnot rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed,\nbut does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs). In this work, we explore a method to incorporate\nhuman-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to a\nneural-network-based de-identification system. Our results show that the\naddition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves the\nstate-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of the\nmost sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life setting\npatient notes typically come with EHRs, we recommend developers of\nde-identification systems to leverage the information EHRs contain.", "published": "2016-10-30 20:09:46", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09704v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
