{"title": "Learning Lexical Entries for Robotic Commands using Crowdsourcing", "abstract": "Robotic commands in natural language usually contain various spatial\ndescriptions that are semantically similar but syntactically different. Mapping\nsuch syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots\nis challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To\ntackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and\nmanipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and\nuse a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from\nnatural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to\nsimulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing\nplatforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to\nrobot language with paraphrases.", "published": "2016-09-08 19:51:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02549v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
