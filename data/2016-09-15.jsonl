{"title": "Factored Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "We present a new approach for neural machine translation (NMT) using the\nmorphological and grammatical decomposition of the words (factors) in the\noutput side of the neural network. This architecture addresses two main\nproblems occurring in MT, namely dealing with a large target language\nvocabulary and the out of vocabulary (OOV) words. By the means of factors, we\nare able to handle larger vocabulary and reduce the training time (for systems\nwith equivalent target language vocabulary size). In addition, we can produce\nnew words that are not in the vocabulary. We use a morphological analyser to\nget a factored representation of each word (lemmas, Part of Speech tag, tense,\nperson, gender and number). We have extended the NMT approach with attention\nmechanism in order to have two different outputs, one for the lemmas and the\nother for the rest of the factors. The final translation is built using some\n\\textit{a priori} linguistic information. We compare our extension with a\nword-based NMT system. The experiments, performed on the IWSLT'15 dataset\ntranslating from English to French, show that while the performance do not\nalways increase, the system can manage a much larger vocabulary and\nconsistently reduce the OOV rate. We observe up to 2% BLEU point improvement in\na simulated out of domain translation setup.", "published": "2016-09-15 13:15:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04621v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Characterizing the Language of Online Communities and its Relation to\n  Community Reception", "abstract": "This work investigates style and topic aspects of language in online\ncommunities: looking at both utility as an identifier of the community and\ncorrelation with community reception of content. Style is characterized using a\nhybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language model, while topic is\nrepresented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experiments with several Reddit\nforums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic,\neven for communities organized around specific topics. Further, there is a\npositive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the\nstyle similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.", "published": "2016-09-15 19:07:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04779v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction beyond the Sentence Boundary", "abstract": "The growing demand for structured knowledge has led to great interest in\nrelation extraction, especially in cases with limited supervision. However,\nexisting distance supervision approaches only extract relations expressed in\nsingle sentences. In general, cross-sentence relation extraction is\nunder-explored, even in the supervised-learning setting. In this paper, we\npropose the first approach for applying distant supervision to cross- sentence\nrelation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation that\ncan incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus\nproviding a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We\nextract features from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and\nrobustness when confronted with linguistic variation and analysis error.\nExperiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine show that\nour approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only a small\nexisting knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles.\nCompared to the existing distant supervision paradigm, our approach extracted\ntwice as many relations at similar precision, thus demonstrating the prevalence\nof cross-sentence relations and the promise of our approach.", "published": "2016-09-15 22:01:26", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04873v3", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Context Aware Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Clustering", "abstract": "In this article we propose a method to refine the clustering results obtained\nwith the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, imposing consistency\nconstraints on the final labeling of the data. The research community focused\nits effort on the initialization and on the optimization part of this method,\nwithout paying attention to the final cluster assignments. We propose a game\ntheoretic framework in which each object to be clustered is represented as a\nplayer, which has to choose its cluster membership. The information obtained\nwith NMF is used to initialize the strategy space of the players and a weighted\ngraph is used to model the interactions among the players. These interactions\nallow the players to choose a cluster which is coherent with the clusters\nchosen by similar players, a property which is not guaranteed by NMF, since it\nproduces a soft clustering of the data. The results on common benchmarks show\nthat our model is able to improve the performances of many NMF formulations.", "published": "2016-09-15 13:23:43", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04628v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.GT"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
