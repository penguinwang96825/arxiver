{"title": "Integrate Document Ranking Information into Confidence Measure\n  Calculation for Spoken Term Detection", "abstract": "This paper proposes an algorithm to improve the calculation of confidence\nmeasure for spoken term detection (STD). Given an input query term, the\nalgorithm first calculates a measurement named document ranking weight for each\ndocument in the speech database to reflect its relevance with the query term by\nsumming all the confidence measures of the hypothesized term occurrences in\nthis document. The confidence measure of each term occurrence is then\nre-estimated through linear interpolation with the calculated document ranking\nweight to improve its reliability by integrating document-level information.\nExperiments are conducted on three standard STD tasks for Tamil, Vietnamese and\nEnglish respectively. The experimental results all demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art\nmethod for confidence measure calculation. Furthermore, this algorithm is still\neffective even if a high accuracy speech recognizer is not available, which\nmakes it applicable for the languages with limited speech resources.", "published": "2015-09-07 04:40:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01899v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

In this study we develop techniques for extracting parallel\ndata for one particular dialect of Arabic (Iraqi Arabic) from out-of-domain\ncorpora in different dialects of Arabic or in Modern Standard Arabic. We\ncompare two different data selection strategies (cross-entropy based and\nsubmodular selection) and demonstrate that a very small but highly targeted\namount of found data can improve the performance of a baseline machine\ntranslation system. We furthermore report on preliminary experiments on using\nautomatically translated speech data as additional training data.", "published": "2015-09-07 07:54:17", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01938v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Unsupervised Discovery of Linguistic Structure Including Two-level\n  Acoustic Patterns Using Three Cascaded Stages of Iterative Optimization", "abstract": "Techniques for unsupervised discovery of acoustic patterns are getting\nincreasingly attractive, because huge quantities of speech data are becoming\navailable but manual annotations remain hard to acquire. In this paper, we\npropose an approach for unsupervised discovery of linguistic structure for the\ntarget spoken language given raw speech data. This linguistic structure\nincludes two-level (subword-like and word-like) acoustic patterns, the lexicon\nof word-like patterns in terms of subword-like patterns and the N-gram language\nmodel based on word-like patterns. All patterns, models, and parameters can be\nautomatically learned from the unlabelled speech corpus. This is achieved by an\ninitialization step followed by three cascaded stages for acoustic, linguistic,\nand lexical iterative optimization. The lexicon of word-like patterns defines\nallowed consecutive sequence of HMMs for subword-like patterns. In each\niteration, model training and decoding produces updated labels from which the\nlexicon and HMMs can be further updated. In this way, model parameters and\ndecoded labels are respectively optimized in each iteration, and the knowledge\nabout the linguistic structure is learned gradually layer after layer. The\nproposed approach was tested in preliminary experiments on a corpus of Mandarin\nbroadcast news, including a task of spoken term detection with performance\ncompared to a parallel test using models trained in a supervised way. Results\nshow that the proposed system not only yields reasonable performance on its\nown, but is also complimentary to existing large vocabulary ASR systems.", "published": "2015-09-07 22:23:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02208v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Unsupervised Spoken Term Detection with Spoken Queries by Multi-level\n  Acoustic Patterns with Varying Model Granularity", "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach for unsupervised Spoken Term Detection\nwith spoken queries using multiple sets of acoustic patterns automatically\ndiscovered from the target corpus. The different pattern HMM\nconfigurations(number of states per model, number of distinct models, number of\nGaussians per state)form a three-dimensional model granularity space. Different\nsets of acoustic patterns automatically discovered on different points properly\ndistributed over this three-dimensional space are complementary to one another,\nthus can jointly capture the characteristics of the spoken terms. By\nrepresenting the spoken content and spoken query as sequences of acoustic\npatterns, a series of approaches for matching the pattern index sequences while\nconsidering the signal variations are developed. In this way, not only the\non-line computation load can be reduced, but the signal distributions caused by\ndifferent speakers and acoustic conditions can be reasonably taken care of. The\nresults indicate that this approach significantly outperformed the unsupervised\nfeature-based DTW baseline by 16.16\\% in mean average precision on the TIMIT\ncorpus.", "published": "2015-09-07 22:40:31", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02213v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Enhancing Automatically Discovered Multi-level Acoustic Patterns\n  Considering Context Consistency With Applications in Spoken Term Detection", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing the multiple sets of\nacoustic patterns automatically discovered from a given corpus. In a previous\nwork it was proposed that different HMM configurations (number of states per\nmodel, number of distinct models) for the acoustic patterns form a\ntwo-dimensional space. Multiple sets of acoustic patterns automatically\ndiscovered with the HMM configurations properly located on different points\nover this two-dimensional space were shown to be complementary to one another,\njointly capturing the characteristics of the given corpus. By representing the\ngiven corpus as sequences of acoustic patterns on different HMM sets, the\npattern indices in these sequences can be relabeled considering the context\nconsistency across the different sequences. Good improvements were observed in\npreliminary experiments of pattern spoken term detection (STD) performed on\nboth TIMIT and Mandarin Broadcast News with such enhanced patterns.", "published": "2015-09-07 22:56:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02217v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "An Approach to the Analysis of the South Slavic Medieval Labels Using\n  Image Texture", "abstract": "The paper presents a new script classification method for the discrimination\nof the South Slavic medieval labels. It consists in the textural analysis of\nthe script types. In the first step, each letter is coded by the equivalent\nscript type, which is defined by its typographical features. Obtained coded\ntext is subjected to the run-length statistical analysis and to the adjacent\nlocal binary pattern analysis in order to extract the features. The result\nshows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes\nthe feature classification more effective. It is the basis for the\nclassification process of the script identification by using an extension of a\nstate-of-the-art approach for document clustering. The proposed method is\nevaluated on an example of hand-engraved in stone and hand-printed in paper\nlabels in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic. Experiments demonstrate\nvery positive results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "published": "2015-09-07 10:39:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01978v1", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "I.4; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CV"}
