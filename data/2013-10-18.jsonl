{"title": "Text Classification For Authorship Attribution Analysis", "abstract": "Authorship attribution mainly deals with undecided authorship of literary\ntexts. Authorship attribution is useful in resolving issues like uncertain\nauthorship, recognize authorship of unknown texts, spot plagiarism so on.\nStatistical methods can be used to set apart the approach of an author\nnumerically. The basic methodologies that are made use in computational\nstylometry are word length, sentence length, vocabulary affluence, frequencies\netc. Each author has an inborn style of writing, which is particular to\nhimself. Statistical quantitative techniques can be used to differentiate the\napproach of an author in a numerical way. The problem can be broken down into\nthree sub problems as author identification, author characterization and\nsimilarity detection. The steps involved are pre-processing, extracting\nfeatures, classification and author identification. For this different\nclassifiers can be used. Here fuzzy learning classifier and SVM are used. After\nauthor identification the SVM was found to have more accuracy than Fuzzy\nclassifier. Later combined the classifiers to obtain a better accuracy when\ncompared to individual SVM and fuzzy classifier.", "published": "2013-10-18 04:18:09", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4909v1", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.DL"}
{"title": "A Logic-based Approach for Recognizing Textual Entailment Supported by\n  Ontological Background Knowledge", "abstract": "We present the architecture and the evaluation of a new system for\nrecognizing textual entailment (RTE). In RTE we want to identify automatically\nthe type of a logical relation between two input texts. In particular, we are\ninterested in proving the existence of an entailment between them. We conceive\nour system as a modular environment allowing for a high-coverage syntactic and\nsemantic text analysis combined with logical inference. For the syntactic and\nsemantic analysis we combine a deep semantic analysis with a shallow one\nsupported by statistical models in order to increase the quality and the\naccuracy of results. For RTE we use logical inference of first-order employing\nmodel-theoretic techniques and automated reasoning tools. The inference is\nsupported with problem-relevant background knowledge extracted automatically\nand on demand from external sources like, e.g., WordNet, YAGO, and OpenCyc, or\nother, more experimental sources with, e.g., manually defined presupposition\nresolutions, or with axiomatized general and common sense knowledge. The\nresults show that fine-grained and consistent knowledge coming from diverse\nsources is a necessary condition determining the correctness and traceability\nof results.", "published": "2013-10-18 08:10:32", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4938v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LO"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Distributional semantics beyond words: Supervised learning of analogy\n  and paraphrase", "abstract": "There have been several efforts to extend distributional semantics beyond\nindividual words, to measure the similarity of word pairs, phrases, and\nsentences (briefly, tuples; ordered sets of words, contiguous or\nnoncontiguous). One way to extend beyond words is to compare two tuples using a\nfunction that combines pairwise similarities between the component words in the\ntuples. A strength of this approach is that it works with both relational\nsimilarity (analogy) and compositional similarity (paraphrase). However, past\nwork required hand-coding the combination function for different tasks. The\nmain contribution of this paper is that combination functions are generated by\nsupervised learning. We achieve state-of-the-art results in measuring\nrelational similarity between word pairs (SAT analogies and SemEval~2012 Task\n2) and measuring compositional similarity between noun-modifier phrases and\nunigrams (multiple-choice paraphrase questions).", "published": "2013-10-18 14:50:39", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5042v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "H.3.1; I.2.6; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
