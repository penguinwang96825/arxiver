{"title": "Hierarchical Dirichlet process for tracking complex topical structure\n  evolution and its application to autism research literature", "abstract": "In this paper we describe a novel framework for the discovery of the topical\ncontent of a data corpus, and the tracking of its complex structural changes\nacross the temporal dimension. In contrast to previous work our model does not\nimpose a prior on the rate at which documents are added to the corpus nor does\nit adopt the Markovian assumption which overly restricts the type of changes\nthat the model can capture. Our key technical contribution is a framework based\non (i) discretization of time into epochs, (ii) epoch-wise topic discovery\nusing a hierarchical Dirichlet process-based model, and (iii) a temporal\nsimilarity graph which allows for the modelling of complex topic changes:\nemergence and disappearance, evolution, and splitting and merging. The power of\nthe proposed framework is demonstrated on the medical literature corpus\nconcerned with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - an increasingly important\nresearch subject of significant social and healthcare importance. In addition\nto the collected ASD literature corpus which we will make freely available, our\ncontributions also include two free online tools we built as aids to ASD\nresearchers. These can be used for semantically meaningful navigation and\nsearching, as well as knowledge discovery from this large and rapidly growing\ncorpus of literature.", "published": "2015-02-08 10:25:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02233v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Improving Term Frequency Normalization for Multi-topical Documents, and\n  Application to Language Modeling Approaches", "abstract": "Term frequency normalization is a serious issue since lengths of documents\nare various. Generally, documents become long due to two different reasons -\nverbosity and multi-topicality. First, verbosity means that the same topic is\nrepeatedly mentioned by terms related to the topic, so that term frequency is\nmore increased than the well-summarized one. Second, multi-topicality indicates\nthat a document has a broad discussion of multi-topics, rather than single\ntopic. Although these document characteristics should be differently handled,\nall previous methods of term frequency normalization have ignored these\ndifferences and have used a simplified length-driven approach which decreases\nthe term frequency by only the length of a document, causing an unreasonable\npenalization. To attack this problem, we propose a novel TF normalization\nmethod which is a type of partially-axiomatic approach. We first formulate two\nformal constraints that the retrieval model should satisfy for documents having\nverbose and multi-topicality characteristic, respectively. Then, we modify\nlanguage modeling approaches to better satisfy these two constraints, and\nderive novel smoothing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod increases significantly the precision for keyword queries, and\nsubstantially improves MAP (Mean Average Precision) for verbose queries.", "published": "2015-02-08 17:32:44", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02277v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "H.3.3"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
