{"title": "Agent Learning via Early Experience", "abstract": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own\nexperience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.\nHowever, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning\nremains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards\n(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn\ntool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

In contrast, pruning is typically\ncarried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output\nmismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such\nerrors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively\nmodifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned\nparameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the\ngeometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and\nsimultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.\nFurthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that\nstrongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error\nrecovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect\nthese principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that\nensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By\ncombining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed\nmethod effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to\nbe more important in a geometry-preserving manner.

We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has\nalready produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its\noutput. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory\nand rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models\nand datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.\nWe observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps\nprimarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct\ninitially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a\nquestion-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token\nefficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate\nanswers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated\nby this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a\ncandidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens\nby 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.", "published": "2025-10-09 14:57:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08308v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}

{"title": "NaViL: Rethinking Scaling Properties of Native Multimodal Large Language Models under Data Constraints", "abstract": "Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected\nwith pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the\nmultimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due\nto the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of\nMLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and\nscaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through\ncareful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal\nmeta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,\nwe further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the\npositively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.\nBased on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a\nsimple and cost-effective recipe.

This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal.

The\nmodel is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand\ninteraction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing\nsystem-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each\njoint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net\neffects.

This flexible\nformulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation\ntasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and\ninterpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,\nhowever, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:\nthe temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames\nare compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level\nconditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with\nVideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)\nparadigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose\na hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:\nspatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is\nachieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a\ncontinuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the\nVAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen\nbackbone.

An iterative algorithm employing an\nalternating optimization approach is subsequently developed to determine the\noptimal solution, significantly reducing the solution complexity. Simulation\nresults validate the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system performance.", "published": "2025-10-09 01:42:54", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07668v1", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.SP"}
