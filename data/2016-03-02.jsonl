{"title": "Improving Named Entity Recognition for Chinese Social Media with Word\n  Segmentation Representation Learning", "abstract": "Named entity recognition, and other information extraction tasks, frequently\nuse linguistic features such as part of speech tags or chunkings. For languages\nwhere word boundaries are not readily identified in text, word segmentation is\na key first step to generating features for an NER system. While using word\nboundary tags as features are helpful, the signals that aid in identifying\nthese boundaries may provide richer information for an NER system. New\nstate-of-the-art word segmentation systems use neural models to learn\nrepresentations for predicting word boundaries. We show that these same\nrepresentations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield significant\nimprovements in NER for Chinese social media. In our experiments, jointly\ntraining NER and word segmentation with an LSTM-CRF model yields nearly 5%\nabsolute improvement over previously published results.", "published": "2016-03-02 16:41:40", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00786v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Counter-fitting Word Vectors to Linguistic Constraints", "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel counter-fitting method which injects\nantonymy and synonymy constraints into vector space representations in order to\nimprove the vectors' capability for judging semantic similarity. Applying this\nmethod to publicly available pre-trained word vectors leads to a new state of\nthe art performance on the SimLex-999 dataset. We also show how the method can\nbe used to tailor the word vector space for the downstream task of dialogue\nstate tracking, resulting in robust improvements across different dialogue\ndomains.", "published": "2016-03-02 21:19:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00892v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Character-based Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (MT) has reached state-of-the-art results.\nHowever, one of the main challenges that neural MT still faces is dealing with\nvery large vocabularies and morphologically rich languages. In this paper, we\npropose a neural MT system using character-based embeddings in combination with\nconvolutional and highway layers to replace the standard lookup-based word\nrepresentations. The resulting unlimited-vocabulary and affix-aware source word\nembeddings are tested in a state-of-the-art neural MT based on an\nattention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network. The proposed MT scheme\nprovides improved results even when the source language is not morphologically\nrich. Improvements up to 3 BLEU points are obtained in the German-English WMT\ntask.", "published": "2016-03-02 18:01:57", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00810v3", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
