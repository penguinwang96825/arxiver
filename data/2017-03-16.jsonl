{"title": "Legal Question Answering using Ranking SVM and Deep Convolutional Neural\n  Network", "abstract": "This paper presents a study of employing Ranking SVM and Convolutional Neural\nNetwork for two missions: legal information retrieval and question answering in\nthe Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment. For the first task,\nour proposed model used a triple of features (LSI, Manhattan, Jaccard), and is\nbased on paragraph level instead of article level as in previous studies. In\nfact, each single-paragraph article corresponds to a particular paragraph in a\nhuge multiple-paragraph article. For the legal question answering task,\nadditional statistical features from information retrieval task integrated into\nConvolutional Neural Network contribute to higher accuracy.", "published": "2017-03-16 01:06:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05320v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "14J30 (Primary)", "H.3; H.3.3; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Improving Document Clustering by Eliminating Unnatural Language", "abstract": "Technical documents contain a fair amount of unnatural language, such as\ntables, formulas, pseudo-codes, etc. Unnatural language can be an important\nfactor of confusing existing NLP tools. This paper presents an effective method\nof distinguishing unnatural language from natural language, and evaluates the\nimpact of unnatural language detection on NLP tasks such as document\nclustering. We view this problem as an information extraction task and build a\nmulticlass classification model identifying unnatural language components into\nfour categories. First, we create a new annotated corpus by collecting slides\nand papers in various formats, PPT, PDF, and HTML, where unnatural language\ncomponents are annotated into four categories. We then explore features\navailable from plain text to build a statistical model that can handle any\nformat as long as it is converted into plain text. Our experiments show that\nremoving unnatural language components gives an absolute improvement in\ndocument clustering up to 15%. Our corpus and tool are publicly available.", "published": "2017-03-16 16:32:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05706v2", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
