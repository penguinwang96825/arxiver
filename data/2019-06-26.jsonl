{"title": "Correlators of Polynomial Processes", "abstract": "In the setting of polynomial jump-diffusion dynamics, we provide an explicit formula for computing correlators, namely, cross-moments of the process at different time points along its path. The formula appears as a linear combination of exponentials of the generator matrix, extending the well-known moment formula for polynomial processes. The developed framework can, for example, be applied in financial pricing, such as for path-dependent options and in a stochastic volatility models context. In applications to options, having closed and compact formulations is attractive for sensitivity analysis and risk management, since Greeks can be derived explicitly.", "published": "2019-06-26 19:57:59", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11320v3", "categories": ["math.PR", "math.ST", "q-fin.CP", "q-fin.MF"], "primary_category": "math.PR"}
