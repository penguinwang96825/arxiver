{"title": "An NLP Assistant for Clide", "abstract": "This report describes an NLP assistant for the collaborative development\nenvironment Clide, that supports the development of NLP applications by\nproviding easy access to some common NLP data structures. The assistant\nvisualizes text fragments and their dependencies by displaying the semantic\ngraph of a sentence, the coreference chain of a paragraph and mined triples\nthat are extracted from a paragraph's semantic graphs and linked using its\ncoreference chain. Using this information and a logic programming library, we\ncreate an NLP database which is used by a series of queries to mine the\ntriples. The algorithm is tested by translating a natural language text\ndescribing a graph to an actual graph that is shown as an annotation in the\ntext editor.", "published": "2014-09-07 02:31:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2073v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
