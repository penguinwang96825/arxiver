{"title": "N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations", "abstract": "We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the Transformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number of time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal in proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its depth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical limitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we consider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for which the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome by using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find, however, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a remedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide explanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE Transformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that this fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on the challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for modifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved accuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine translation.", "published": "2020-10-22 00:48:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11358v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "The HUAWEI Speaker Diarisation System for the VoxCeleb Speaker Diarisation Challenge", "abstract": "This paper describes system setup of our submission to speaker diarisation track (Track 4) of VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2020. Our diarisation system consists of a well-trained neural network based speech enhancement model as pre-processing front-end of input speech signals. We replace conventional energy-based voice activity detection (VAD) with a neural network based VAD. The neural network based VAD provides more accurate annotation of speech segments containing only background music, noise, and other interference, which is crucial to diarisation performance. We apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) of x-vectors and variational Bayesian hidden Markov model (VB-HMM) based iterative clustering for speaker clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system achieves substantial improvements over the baseline system, yielding diarisation error rate (DER) of 10.45%, and Jacard error rate (JER) of 22.46% on the evaluation set.", "published": "2020-10-22 12:42:07", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11657v2", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.CL", "eess.AS"], "primary_category": "cs.SD"}
{"title": "Improving Policy-Constrained Kidney Exchange via Pre-Screening", "abstract": "In barter exchanges, participants swap goods with one another without exchanging money; exchanges are often facilitated by a central clearinghouse, with the goal of maximizing the aggregate quality (or number) of swaps. Barter exchanges are subject to many forms of uncertainty--in participant preferences, the feasibility and quality of various swaps, and so on. Our work is motivated by kidney exchange, a real-world barter market in which patients in need of a kidney transplant swap their willing living donors, in order to find a better match. Modern exchanges include 2- and 3-way swaps, making the kidney exchange clearing problem NP-hard. Planned transplants often fail for a variety of reasons--if the donor organ is refused by the recipient's medical team, or if the donor and recipient are found to be medically incompatible. Due to 2- and 3-way swaps, failed transplants can \"cascade\" through an exchange; one US-based exchange estimated that about 85% of planned transplants failed in 2019. Many optimization-based approaches have been designed to avoid these failures; however most exchanges cannot implement these methods due to legal and policy constraints. Instead we consider a setting where exchanges can query the preferences of certain donors and recipients--asking whether they would accept a particular transplant. We characterize this as a two-stage decision problem, in which the exchange program (a) queries a small number of transplants before committing to a matching, and (b) constructs a matching according to fixed policy. We show that selecting these edges is a challenging combinatorial problem, which is non-monotonic and non-submodular, in addition to being NP-hard. We propose both a greedy heuristic and a Monte Carlo tree search, which outperforms previous approaches, using experiments on both synthetic data and real kidney exchange data from the United Network for Organ Sharing.", "published": "2020-10-22 21:07:36", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12069v1", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
{"title": "Text Mining to Identify and Extract Novel Disease Treatments From Unstructured Datasets", "abstract": "Objective: We aim to learn potential novel cures for diseases from unstructured text sources. More specifically, we seek to extract drug-disease pairs of potential cures to diseases by a simple reasoning over the structure of spoken text.\n  Materials and Methods: We use Google Cloud to transcribe podcast episodes of an NPR radio show. We then build a pipeline for systematically pre-processing the text to ensure quality input to the core classification model, which feeds to a series of post-processing steps for obtaining filtered results. Our classification model itself uses a language model pre-trained on PubMed text. The modular nature of our pipeline allows for ease of future developments in this area by substituting higher quality components at each stage of the pipeline. As a validation measure, we use ROBOKOP, an engine over a medical knowledge graph with only validated pathways, as a ground truth source for checking the existence of the proposed pairs. For the proposed pairs not found in ROBOKOP, we provide further verification using Chemotext.\n  Results: We found 30.4% of our proposed pairs in the ROBOKOP database. For example, our model successfully identified that Omeprazole can help treat heartburn.We discuss the significance of this result, showing some examples of the proposed pairs.\n  Discussion and Conclusion: The agreement of our results with the existing knowledge source indicates a step in the right direction. Given the plug-and-play nature of our framework, it is easy to add, remove, or modify parts to improve the model as necessary. We discuss the results showing some examples, and note that this is a potentially new line of research that has further scope to be explored. Although our approach was originally oriented on radio podcast transcripts, it is input-agnostic and could be applied to any source of textual data and to any problem of interest.", "published": "2020-10-22 19:52:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07959v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "Adversarial Attacks on Deep Algorithmic Trading Policies", "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become an appealing solution to algorithmic trading such as high frequency trading of stocks and cyptocurrencies. However, DRL have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. It follows that algorithmic trading DRL agents may also be compromised by such adversarial techniques, leading to policy manipulation. In this paper, we develop a threat model for deep trading policies, and propose two attack techniques for manipulating the performance of such policies at test-time. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks against benchmark and real-world DQN trading agents.", "published": "2020-10-22 02:26:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11388v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
{"title": "Robust Text-Dependent Speaker Verification via Character-Level Information Preservation for the SdSV Challenge 2020", "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to Task 1 of the Short-duration Speaker Verification (SdSV) challenge 2020. Task 1 is a text-dependent speaker verification task, where both the speaker and phrase are required to be verified. The submitted systems were composed of TDNN-based and ResNet-based front-end architectures, in which the frame-level features were aggregated with various pooling methods (e.g., statistical, self-attentive, ghostVLAD pooling). Although the conventional pooling methods provide embeddings with a sufficient amount of speaker-dependent information, our experiments show that these embeddings often lack phrase-dependent information. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new pooling and score compensation methods that leverage a CTC-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for taking the lexical content into account. Both methods showed improvement over the conventional techniques, and the best performance was achieved by fusing all the experimented systems, which showed 0.0785% MinDCF and 2.23% EER on the challenge's evaluation subset.", "published": "2020-10-22 03:22:24", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11408v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}

{"title": "The NTU-AISG Text-to-speech System for Blizzard Challenge 2020", "abstract": "We report our NTU-AISG Text-to-speech (TTS) entry systems for the Blizzard Challenge 2020 in this paper. There are two TTS tasks in this year's challenge, one is a Mandarin TTS task, the other is a Shanghai dialect TTS task. We have participated both. One of the main challenges is to build TTS systems with low-resource constraints, particularly for the case of Shanghai dialect, of which about three hours data are available to participants. To overcome the constraint, we adopt an average-speaker modeling method. That is, we first employ external Mandarin data to train both End-to-end acoustic model and WaveNet vocoder, then we use Shanghai dialect to tune the acoustic model and WaveNet vocoder respectively. Apart from this, we have no Shanghai dialect lexicon despite syllable transcripts are provided for the training data. Since we are not sure if similar syllable transcripts are provided for the evaluation data during the training stage, we use Mandarin lexicon for Shanghai dialect instead. With the letter, as decomposed from the corresponding Mandarin syllable, as input, though the naturalness and original speaker similarity of the synthesized speech are good, subjective evaluation results indicate the intelligibility of the synthesized speech is deeply undermined for the Shanghai dialect TTS system.", "published": "2020-10-22 07:18:08", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11489v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.SD"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
{"title": "DBNET: DOA-driven beamforming network for end-to-end farfield sound source separation", "abstract": "Many deep learning techniques are available to perform source separation and reduce background noise. However, designing an end-to-end multi-channel source separation method using deep learning and conventional acoustic signal processing techniques still remains challenging. In this paper we propose a direction-of-arrival-driven beamforming network (DBnet) consisting of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and beamforming layers for end-to-end source separation. We propose to train DBnet using loss functions that are solely based on the distances between the separated speech signals and the target speech signals, without a need for the ground-truth DOAs of speakers. To improve the source separation performance, we also propose end-to-end extensions of DBnet which incorporate post masking networks. We evaluate the proposed DBnet and its extensions on a very challenging dataset, targeting realistic far-field sound source separation in reverberant and noisy environments. The experimental results show that the proposed extended DBnet using a convolutional-recurrent post masking network outperforms state-of-the-art source separation methods.", "published": "2020-10-22 09:52:05", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11566v1", "categories": ["eess.AS", "cs.AI", "eess.SP"], "primary_category": "eess.AS"}
