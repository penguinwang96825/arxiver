{"title": "Optimal Execution in Intraday Energy Markets under Hawkes Processes with Transient Impact", "abstract": "This paper investigates optimal execution strategies in intraday energy\nmarkets through a mutually exciting Hawkes process model. Calibrated to data\nfrom the German intraday electricity market, the model effectively captures key\nempirical features, including intra-session volatility, distinct intraday\nmarket activity patterns, and the Samuelson effect as gate closure approaches.\nBy integrating a transient price impact model with a bivariate Hawkes process\nto model the market order flow, we derive an optimal trading trajectory for\nenergy companies managing large volumes, accounting for the specific trading\npatterns in these markets. A back-testing analysis compares the proposed\nstrategy against standard benchmarks such as Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)\nand Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), demonstrating substantial cost\nreductions across various hourly trading products in intraday energy markets.", "published": "2025-04-14 14:51:18", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10282v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "49J15, 91G80"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
