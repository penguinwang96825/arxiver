{"title": "Basic Classes of Grammars with Prohibition", "abstract": "A practical tool for natural language modeling and development of\nhuman-machine interaction is developed in the context of formal grammars and\nlanguages. A new type of formal grammars, called grammars with prohibition, is\nintroduced. Grammars with prohibition provide more powerful tools for natural\nlanguage generation and better describe processes of language learning than the\nconventional formal grammars. Here we study relations between languages\ngenerated by different grammars with prohibition based on conventional types of\nformal grammars such as context-free or context sensitive grammars. Besides, we\ncompare languages generated by different grammars with prohibition and\nlanguages generated by conventional formal grammars. In particular, it is\ndemonstrated that they have essentially higher computational power and\nexpressive possibilities in comparison with the conventional formal grammars.\nThus, while conventional formal grammars are recursive and subrecursive\nalgorithms, many classes of grammars with prohibition are superrecursive\nalgorithms. Results presented in this work are aimed at the development of\nhuman-machine interaction, modeling natural languages, empowerment of\nprogramming languages, computer simulation, better software systems, and theory\nof recursion.", "published": "2013-02-21 04:58:48", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5181v1", "categories": ["cs.FL", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.FL"}
