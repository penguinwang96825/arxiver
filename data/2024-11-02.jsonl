{"title": "Combining Financial Data and News Articles for Stock Price Movement Prediction Using Large Language Models", "abstract": "Predicting financial markets and stock price movements requires analyzing a\ncompany's performance, historic price movements, industry-specific events\nalongside the influence of human factors such as social media and press\ncoverage. We assume that financial reports (such as income statements, balance\nsheets, and cash flow statements), historical price data, and recent news\narticles can collectively represent aforementioned factors. We combine\nfinancial data in tabular format with textual news articles and employ\npre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict market movements. Recent\nresearch in LLMs has demonstrated that they are able to perform both tabular\nand text classification tasks, making them our primary model to classify the\nmulti-modal data. We utilize retrieval augmentation techniques to retrieve and\nattach relevant chunks of news articles to financial metrics related to a\ncompany and prompt the LLMs in zero, two, and four-shot settings. Our dataset\ncontains news articles collected from different sources, historic stock price,\nand financial report data for 20 companies with the highest trading volume\nacross different industries in the stock market. We utilized recently released\nlanguage models for our LLM-based classifier, including GPT- 3 and 4, and\nLLaMA- 2 and 3 models. We introduce an LLM-based classifier capable of\nperforming classification tasks using combination of tabular (structured) and\ntextual (unstructured) data. By using this model, we predicted the movement of\na given stock's price in our dataset with a weighted F1-score of 58.5% and\n59.1% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.175 for both 3-month and\n6-month periods.", "published": "2024-11-02 21:53:20", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01368v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"title": "FinBERT-BiLSTM: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Volatile Cryptocurrency Market Prices Using Market Sentiment Dynamics", "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a key tool in financial markets, helping to\npredict asset prices and guide investment decisions. In highly volatile\nmarkets, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH),\nforecasting becomes more difficult due to extreme price fluctuations driven by\nmarket sentiment, technological changes, and regulatory shifts. Traditionally,\nforecasting relied on statistical methods, but as markets became more complex,\ndeep learning models like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and the newer FinBERT-LSTM emerged to\ncapture intricate patterns. Building upon recent advancements and addressing\nthe volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets, we propose a hybrid model\nthat combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks with\nFinBERT to enhance forecasting accuracy for these assets. This approach fills a\nkey gap in forecasting volatile financial markets by blending advanced time\nseries models with sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights for investors\nand analysts navigating unpredictable markets.", "published": "2024-11-02 14:43:06", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12748v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
