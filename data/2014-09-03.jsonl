{"title": "On the Properties of Neural Machine Translation: Encoder-Decoder\n  Approaches", "abstract": "Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical\nmachine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine\ntranslation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder\nextracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence,\nand the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In\nthis paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine\ntranslation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated\nrecursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine\ntranslation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words,\nbut its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the\nnumber of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated\nrecursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence\nautomatically.", "published": "2014-09-03 21:03:41", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1259v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Overcoming the Curse of Sentence Length for Neural Machine Translation\n  using Automatic Segmentation", "abstract": "The authors of (Cho et al., 2014a) have shown that the recently introduced\nneural network translation systems suffer from a significant drop in\ntranslation quality when translating long sentences, unlike existing\nphrase-based translation systems. In this paper, we propose a way to address\nthis issue by automatically segmenting an input sentence into phrases that can\nbe easily translated by the neural network translation model. Once each segment\nhas been independently translated by the neural machine translation model, the\ntranslated clauses are concatenated to form a final translation. Empirical\nresults show a significant improvement in translation quality for long\nsentences.", "published": "2014-09-03 21:00:49", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1257v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.NE", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
