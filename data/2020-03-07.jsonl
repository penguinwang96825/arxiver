{"title": "ECSP: A New Task for Emotion-Cause Span-Pair Extraction and\n  Classification", "abstract": "Emotion cause analysis such as emotion cause extraction (ECE) and\nemotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) have gradually attracted the attention of\nmany researchers. However, there are still two shortcomings in the existing\nresearch: 1) In most cases, emotion expression and cause are not the whole\nclause, but the span in the clause, so extracting the clause-pair rather than\nthe span-pair greatly limits its applications in real-world scenarios; 2) It is\nnot enough to extract the emotion expression clause without identifying the\nemotion categories, the presence of emotion clause does not necessarily convey\nemotional information explicitly due to different possible causes. In this\npaper, we propose a new task: Emotion-Cause Span-Pair extraction and\nclassification (ECSP), which aims to extract the potential span-pair of emotion\nand corresponding causes in a document, and make emotion classification for\neach pair. In the new ECSP task, ECE and ECPE can be regarded as two special\ncases at the clause-level. We propose a span-based extract-then-classify (ETC)\nmodel, where emotion and cause are directly extracted and paired from the\ndocument under the supervision of target span boundaries, and corresponding\ncategories are then classified using their pair representations and localized\ncontext. Experiments show that our proposed ETC model outperforms the SOTA\nmodel of ECE and ECPE task respectively and gets a fair-enough results on ECSP\ntask.", "published": "2020-03-07 03:36:47", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03507v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Automatic Recognition of the General-Purpose Communicative Functions\n  defined by the ISO 24617-2 Standard for Dialog Act Annotation", "abstract": "ISO 24617-2, the standard for dialog act annotation, defines a hierarchically\norganized set of general-purpose communicative functions. The automatic\nrecognition of these functions, although practically unexplored, is relevant\nfor a dialog system, since they provide cues regarding the intention behind the\nsegments and how they should be interpreted. We explore the recognition of\ngeneral-purpose communicative functions in the DialogBank, which is a reference\nset of dialogs annotated according to this standard. To do so, we propose\nadaptations of existing approaches to flat dialog act recognition that allow\nthem to deal with the hierarchical classification problem. More specifically,\nwe propose the use of a hierarchical network with cascading outputs and maximum\na posteriori path estimation to predict the communicative function at each\nlevel of the hierarchy, preserve the dependencies between the functions in the\npath, and decide at which level to stop. Furthermore, since the amount of\ndialogs in the DialogBank is reduced, we rely on transfer learning processes to\nreduce overfitting and improve performance. The results of our experiments show\nthat the hierarchical approach outperforms a flat one and that each of its\ncomponents plays an important role towards the recognition of general-purpose\ncommunicative functions.", "published": "2020-03-07 11:21:03", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03556v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "H.1.2; H.3.1; I.2.7"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Discovering linguistic (ir)regularities in word embeddings through\n  max-margin separating hyperplanes", "abstract": "We experiment with new methods for learning how related words are positioned\nrelative to each other in word embedding spaces. Previous approaches learned\nconstant vector offsets: vectors that point from source tokens to target tokens\nwith an assumption that these offsets were parallel to each other. We show that\nthe offsets between related tokens are closer to orthogonal than parallel, and\nthat they have low cosine similarities. We proceed by making a different\nassumption; target tokens are linearly separable from source and un-labeled\ntokens. We show that a max-margin hyperplane can separate target tokens and\nthat vectors orthogonal to this hyperplane represent the relationship between\nsource and targets. We find that this representation of the relationship\nobtains the best results in dis-covering linguistic regularities.

{"title": "Multi-task Learning Based Neural Bridging Reference Resolution", "abstract": "We propose a multi task learning-based neural model for resolving bridging\nreferences tackling two key challenges. The first challenge is the lack of\nlarge corpora annotated with bridging references. To address this, we use\nmulti-task learning to help bridging reference resolution with coreference\nresolution. We show that substantial improvements of up to 8 p.p. can be\nachieved on full bridging resolution with this architecture. The second\nchallenge is the different definitions of bridging used in different corpora,\nmeaning that hand-coded systems or systems using special features designed for\none corpus do not work well with other corpora. Our neural model only uses a\nsmall number of corpus independent features, thus can be applied to different\ncorpora. Evaluations with very different bridging corpora (ARRAU, ISNOTES,\nBASHI and SCICORP) suggest that our architecture works equally well on all\ncorpora, and achieves the SoTA results on full bridging resolution for all\ncorpora, outperforming the best reported results by up to 36.3 p.p..", "published": "2020-03-07 21:21:29", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03666v2", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "A Post-processing Method for Detecting Unknown Intent of Dialogue System\n  via Pre-trained Deep Neural Network Classifier", "abstract": "With the maturity and popularity of dialogue systems, detecting user's\nunknown intent in dialogue systems has become an important task. It is also one\nof the most challenging tasks since we can hardly get examples, prior knowledge\nor the exact numbers of unknown intents. In this paper, we propose SofterMax\nand deep novelty detection (SMDN), a simple yet effective post-processing\nmethod for detecting unknown intent in dialogue systems based on pre-trained\ndeep neural network classifiers. Our method can be flexibly applied on top of\nany classifiers trained in deep neural networks without changing the model\narchitecture. We calibrate the confidence of the softmax outputs to compute the\ncalibrated confidence score (i.e., SofterMax) and use it to calculate the\ndecision boundary for unknown intent detection. Furthermore, we feed the\nfeature representations learned by the deep neural networks into traditional\nnovelty detection algorithm to detect unknown intents from different\nperspectives. Finally, we combine the methods above to perform the joint\nprediction. Our method classifies examples that differ from known intents as\nunknown and does not require any examples or prior knowledge of it. We have\nconducted extensive experiments on three benchmark dialogue datasets. The\nresults show that our method can yield significant improvements compared with\nthe state-of-the-art baselines", "published": "2020-03-07 03:29:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03504v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Frozen Binomials on the Web: Word Ordering and Language Conventions in\n  Online Text", "abstract": "There is inherent information captured in the order in which we write words\nin a list. The orderings of binomials --- lists of two words separated by `and'\nor `or' --- has been studied for more than a century. These binomials are\ncommon across many areas of speech, in both formal and informal text. In the\nlast century, numerous explanations have been given to describe what order\npeople use for these binomials, from differences in semantics to differences in\nphonology. These rules describe primarily `frozen' binomials that exist in\nexactly one ordering and have lacked large-scale trials to determine efficacy.\n  Online text provides a unique opportunity to study these lists in the context\nof informal text at a very large scale. In this work, we expand the view of\nbinomials to include a large-scale analysis of both frozen and non-frozen\nbinomials in a quantitative way. Using this data, we then demonstrate that most\npreviously proposed rules are ineffective at predicting binomial ordering. By\ntracking the order of these binomials across time and communities we are able\nto establish additional, unexplored dimensions central to these predictions.\n  Expanding beyond the question of individual binomials, we also explore the\nglobal structure of binomials in various communities, establishing a new model\nfor these lists and analyzing this structure for non-frozen and frozen\nbinomials. Additionally, novel analysis of trinomials --- lists of length three\n--- suggests that none of the binomials analysis applies in these cases.\nFinally, we demonstrate how large data sets gleaned from the web can be used in\nconjunction with older theories to expand and improve on old questions.", "published": "2020-03-07 17:22:52", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03612v1", "categories": ["cs.SI", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.SI"}

Our work makes the first attempt to build such a\ndataset. Different from creating general-domain VQA datasets where the images\nare widely accessible and there are many crowdsourcing workers available and\ncapable of generating question-answer pairs, developing a medical VQA dataset\nis much more challenging. First, due to privacy concerns, pathology images are\nusually not publicly available.
