{"title": "The Manifold of Human Emotions", "abstract": "Sentiment analysis predicts the presence of positive or negative emotions in\na text document. In this paper, we consider higher dimensional extensions of\nthe sentiment concept, which represent a richer set of human emotions. Our\napproach goes beyond previous work in that our model contains a continuous\nmanifold rather than a finite set of human emotions. We investigate the\nresulting model, compare it to psychological observations, and explore its\npredictive capabilities.", "published": "2013-01-15 03:45:27", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3214v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "The Expressive Power of Word Embeddings", "abstract": "We seek to better understand the difference in quality of the several\npublicly released embeddings. We propose several tasks that help to distinguish\nthe characteristics of different embeddings. Our evaluation of sentiment\npolarity and synonym/antonym relations shows that embeddings are able to\ncapture surprisingly nuanced semantics even in the absence of sentence\nstructure. Moreover, benchmarking the embeddings shows great variance in\nquality and characteristics of the semantics captured by the tested embeddings.\nFinally, we show the impact of varying the number of dimensions and the\nresolution of each dimension on the effective useful features captured by the\nembedding space. Our contributions highlight the importance of embeddings for\nNLP tasks and the effect of their quality on the final results.", "published": "2013-01-15 04:52:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3226v4", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL", "stat.ML"], "primary_category": "cs.LG"}
