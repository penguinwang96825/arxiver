{"title": "Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States", "abstract": "Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational\ndata that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a\npopular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological\ndata analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many\nreal-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order\ninteractions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive\ncost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of\nsuch complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser\nsimplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while\nmaintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.\n  In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of\nSCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling\nprobability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the\nspectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the\ncorresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a \"kernel-ignoring\"\ndecomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we\nexploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic\ncomplexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is\ndemonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.", "published": "2025-02-11 13:51:42", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.CG", "cs.DM", "cs.NA", "cs.SI", "math.NA"], "primary_category": "stat.ML"}
{"title": "Minimal Shortfall Strategies for Liquidation of a Basket of Stocks using Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "This paper studies the ubiquitous problem of liquidating large quantities of\nhighly correlated stocks, a task frequently encountered by institutional\ninvestors and proprietary trading firms. Traditional methods in this setting\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality, making them impractical for\nhigh-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a novel method based on\nstochastic optimal control to optimally tackle this complex multidimensional\nproblem. The proposed method minimizes the overall execution shortfall of\nhighly correlated stocks using a reinforcement learning approach. We rigorously\nestablish the convergence of our optimal trading strategy and present an\nimplementation of our algorithm using intra-day market data.", "published": "2025-02-11 18:55:14", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07868v1", "categories": ["q-fin.TR", "math.OC", "q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.TR"}
{"title": "Integrating the implied regularity into implied volatility models: A study on free arbitrage model", "abstract": "Implied volatility IV is a key metric in financial markets, reflecting market\nexpectations of future price fluctuations. Research has explored IV's\nrelationship with moneyness, focusing on its connection to the implied Hurst\nexponent H. Our study reveals that H approaches 1/2 when moneyness equals 1,\nmarking a critical point in market efficiency expectations. We developed an IV\nmodel that integrates H to capture these dynamics more effectively. This model\nconsiders the interaction between H and the underlying-to-strike price ratio\nS/K, crucial for capturing IV variations based on moneyness. Using Optuna\noptimization across multiple indexes, the model outperformed SABR and fSABR in\naccuracy. This approach provides a more detailed representation of market\nexpectations and IV-H dynamics, improving options pricing and volatility\nforecasting while enhancing theoretical and pratcical financial analysis.", "published": "2025-02-11 12:44:45", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07518v1", "categories": ["q-fin.CP"], "primary_category": "q-fin.CP"}
{"title": "Intraday order transition dynamics in high, medium, and low market cap stocks: A Markov chain approach", "abstract": "An empirical stochastic analysis of high-frequency, tick-by-tick order data\nof NASDAQ100 listed stocks is conducted using a first-order discrete-time\nMarkov chain model to explore intraday order transition dynamics. This analysis\nfocuses on three market cap categories: High, Medium, and Low. Time-homogeneous\ntransition probability matrices are estimated and compared across time-zones\nand market cap categories, and we found that limit orders exhibit higher degree\nof inertia (DoI), i.e., the probability of placing consecutive limit order is\nhigher, during the opening hour. However, in the subsequent hour, the DoI of\nlimit order decreases, while that of market order increases. Limit order\nadjustments via additions and deletions of limit orders increases significantly\nafter the opening hour. All the order transitions then stabilize during\nmid-hours. As the closing hour approaches, consecutive order executions surge,\nwith decreased placement of buy and sell limit orders following sell and buy\nexecutions, respectively. In terms of the differences in order transitions\nbetween stocks of different market cap, DoI of orders is stronger in high and\nmedium market cap stocks. On the other hand, lower market cap stocks show a\nhigher probability of limit order modifications and greater likelihood of\nsubmitting sell/buy limit orders after buy/sell executions. Further, order\ntransitions are clustered across all stocks, except during opening and closing\nhours. The findings of this study may be useful in understanding intraday order\nplacement dynamics across stocks of varying market cap, thus aiding market\nparticipants in making informed order placements at different times of trading\nhour.", "published": "2025-02-11 15:13:10", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07625v1", "categories": ["q-fin.ST", "q-fin.TR"], "primary_category": "q-fin.ST"}
