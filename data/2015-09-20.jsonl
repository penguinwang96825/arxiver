{"title": "Early text classification: a Naive solution", "abstract": "Text classification is a widely studied problem, and it can be considered\nsolved for some domains and under certain circumstances. There are scenarios,\nhowever, that have received little or no attention at all, despite its\nrelevance and applicability. One of such scenarios is early text\nclassification, where one needs to know the category of a document by using\npartial information only. A document is processed as a sequence of terms, and\nthe goal is to devise a method that can make predictions as fast as possible.\nThe importance of this variant of the text classification problem is evident in\ndomains like sexual predator detection, where one wants to identify an offender\nas early as possible. This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naive\nBayes classifier for approaching this problem. Specifically, we assess its\nperformance when classifying documents after seeing an increasingly number of\nterms. A simple modification to the standard naive Bayes implementation allows\nus to make predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge\nnaive Bayes has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive\nexperimental evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early\ntext classification. What is more, we show that this simple solution is very\ncompetitive when compared with state of the art methodologies that are more\nelaborated. We foresee our work will pave the way for the development of more\neffective early text classification techniques based in the naive Bayes\nformulation.", "published": "2015-09-20 21:01:51", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06053v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
