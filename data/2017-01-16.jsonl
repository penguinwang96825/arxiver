{"title": "Deep Memory Networks for Attitude Identification", "abstract": "We consider the task of identifying attitudes towards a given set of entities\nfrom text. Conventionally, this task is decomposed into two separate subtasks:\ntarget detection that identifies whether each entity is mentioned in the text,\neither explicitly or implicitly, and polarity classification that classifies\nthe exact sentiment towards an identified entity (the target) into positive,\nnegative, or neutral.\n  Instead, we show that attitude identification can be solved with an\nend-to-end machine learning architecture, in which the two subtasks are\ninterleaved by a deep memory network. In this way, signals produced in target\ndetection provide clues for polarity classification, and reversely, the\npredicted polarity provides feedback to the identification of targets.\nMoreover, the treatments for the set of targets also influence each other --\nthe learned representations may share the same semantics for some targets but\nvary for others. The proposed deep memory network, the AttNet, outperforms\nmethods that do not consider the interactions between the subtasks or those\namong the targets, including conventional machine learning methods and the\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models.", "published": "2017-01-16 06:49:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04189v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Machine Translation Approaches and Survey for Indian Languages", "abstract": "In this study, we present an analysis regarding the performance of the\nstate-of-art Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) on multiple\nIndian languages. We report baseline systems on several language pairs. The\nmotivation of this study is to promote the development of SMT and linguistic\nresources for these language pairs, as the current state-of-the-art is quite\nbleak due to sparse data resources. The success of an SMT system is contingent\non the availability of a large parallel corpus. Such data is necessary to\nreliably estimate translation probabilities. We report the performance of\nbaseline systems translating from Indian languages (Bengali, Guajarati, Hindi,\nMalayalam, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu) into English with average 10%\naccurate results for all the language pairs.", "published": "2017-01-16 13:55:01", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04290v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.CL"}
{"title": "Semantic classifier approach to document classification", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new document classification method, bridging\ndiscrepancies (so-called semantic gap) between the training set and the\napplication sets of textual data. We demonstrate its superiority over classical\ntext classification approaches, including traditional classifier ensembles. The\nmethod consists in combining a document categorization technique with a single\nclassifier or a classifier ensemble (SEMCOM algorithm - Committee with Semantic\nCategorizer).", "published": "2017-01-16 14:02:19", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04292v1", "categories": ["cs.IR", "cs.CL"], "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
